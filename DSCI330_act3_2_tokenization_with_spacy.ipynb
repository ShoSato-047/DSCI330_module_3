and, at fifty-four, was still a very fine man.\\nfew women could think more of their personal appearance than he did,\\nnor could the valet of any new made lord be more delighted with\\nthe place he held in society.  he considered the blessing of beauty\\nas inferior only to the blessing of a baronetcy; and the sir walter elliot,\\nwho united these gifts, was the constant object of his warmest respect\\nand devotion.\\n\\nhis good looks and his rank had one fair claim on his attachment;\\nsince to them he must have owed a wife of very superior character\\nto any thing deserved by his own.  lady elliot had been an excellent woman,\\nsensible and amiable; whose judgement and conduct, if they might be\\npardoned the youthful infatuation which made her lady elliot,\\nhad never required indulgence afterwards.--she had humoured,\\nor softened, or concealed his failings, and promoted his real\\nrespectability for seventeen years; and though not the very happiest\\nbeing in the world herself, had found enough in her duties, her friends,\\nand her children, to attach her to life, and make it no matter of\\nindifference to her when she was called on to quit them.\\n--three girls, the two eldest sixteen and fourteen, was an awful legacy\\nfor a mother to bequeath, an awful charge rather, to confide to\\nthe authority and guidance of a conceited, silly father.\\nshe had, however, one very intimate friend, a sensible, deserving woman,\\nwho had been brought, by strong attachment to herself, to settle\\nclose by her, in the village of kellynch; and on her kindness and advice,\\nlady elliot mainly relied for the best help and maintenance of\\nthe good principles and instruction which she had been anxiously\\ngiving her daughters.\\n\\nthis friend, and sir walter, did not marry, whatever might have been\\nanticipated on that head by their acquaintance.  thirteen years\\nhad passed away since lady elliot\\'s death, and they were still\\nnear neighbours and intimate friends, and one remained a widower,\\nthe other a widow.\\n\\nthat lady russell, of steady age and character, and extremely\\nwell provided for, should have no thought of a second marriage,\\nneeds no apology to the public, which is rather apt to be unreasonably\\ndiscontented when a woman does marry again, than when she does not;\\nbut sir walter\\'s continuing in singleness requires explanation.\\nbe it known then, that sir walter, like a good father, (having met with\\none or two private disappointments in very unreasonable applications),\\nprided himself on remaining single for his dear daughters\\' sake.\\nfor one daughter, his eldest, he would really have given up any thing,\\nwhich he had not been very much tempted to do.  elizabeth had succeeded,\\nat sixteen, to all that was possible, of her mother\\'s rights\\nand consequence; and being very handsome, and very like himself,\\nher influence had always been great, and they had gone on together\\nmost happily.  his two other children were of very inferior value.\\nmary had acquired a little artificial importance, by becoming\\nmrs charles musgrove; but anne, with an elegance of mind and sweetness\\nof character, which must have placed her high with any people\\nof real understanding, was nobody with either father or sister;\\nher word had no weight, her convenience was always to give way--\\nshe was only anne.\\n\\nto lady russell, indeed, she was a most dear and highly valued\\ngod-daughter, favourite, and friend.  lady russell loved them all;\\nbut it was only in anne that she could fancy the mother to revive again.\\n\\na few years before, anne elliot had been a very pretty girl,\\nbut her bloom had vanished early; and as even in its height,\\nher father had found little to admire in her, (so totally different\\nwere her delicate features and mild dark eyes from his own),\\nthere could be nothing in them, now that she was faded and thin,\\nto excite his esteem. he had never indulged much hope, he had now none,\\nof ever reading her name in any other page of his favourite work.\\nall equality of alliance must rest with elizabeth, for mary had merely\\nconnected herself with an old country family of respectability and\\nlarge fortune, and had therefore given all the honour and received none:\\nelizabeth would, one day or other, marry suitably.\\n\\nit sometimes happens that a woman is handsomer at twenty-nine than\\nshe was ten years before; and, generally speaking, if there has been\\nneither ill health nor anxiety, it is a time of life at which scarcely any\\ncharm is lost.  it was so with elizabeth, still the same handsome\\nmiss elliot that she had begun to be thirteen years ago, and sir walter\\nmight be excused, therefore, in forgetting her age, or, at least,\\nbe deemed only half a fool, for thinking himself and elizabeth\\nas blooming as ever, amidst the wreck of the good looks of everybody else;\\nfor he could plainly see how old all the rest of his family and\\nacquaintance were growing.  anne haggard, mary coarse, every face\\nin the neighbourhood worsting, and the rapid increase of the crow\\'s foot\\nabout lady russell\\'s temples had long been a distress to him.\\n\\nelizabeth did not quite equal her father in personal contentment.\\nthirteen years had seen her mistress of kellynch hall, presiding and\\ndirecting with a self-possession and decision which could never have given\\nthe idea of her being younger than she was.  for thirteen years had\\nshe been doing the honours, and laying down the domestic law at home,\\nand leading the way to the chaise and four, and walking immediately after\\nlady russell out of all the drawing-rooms and dining-rooms in the country.\\nthirteen winters\\' revolving frosts had seen her opening every ball\\nof credit which a scanty neighbourhood afforded, and thirteen springs\\nshewn their blossoms, as she travelled up to london with her father,\\nfor a few weeks\\' annual enjoyment of the great world.  she had\\nthe remembrance of all this, she had the consciousness of being\\nnine-and-twenty to give her some regrets and some apprehensions;\\nshe was fully satisfied of being still quite as handsome as ever,\\nbut she felt her approach to the years of danger, and would have rejoiced\\nto be certain of being properly solicited by baronet-blood within\\nthe next twelvemonth or two.  then might she again take up\\nthe book of books with as much enjoyment as in her early youth,\\nbut now she liked it not.  always to be presented with the date of\\nher own birth and see no marriage follow but that of a youngest sister,\\nmade the book an evil; and more than once, when her father had left it\\nopen on the table near her, had she closed it, with averted eyes,\\nand pushed it away.\\n\\nshe had had a disappointment, moreover, which that book,\\nand especially the history of her own family, must ever present\\nthe remembrance of.  the heir presumptive, the very william walter\\nelliot, esq., whose rights had been so generously supported\\nby her father, had disappointed her.\\n\\nshe had, while a very young girl, as soon as she had known him to be,\\nin the event of her having no brother, the future baronet,\\nmeant to marry him, and her father had always meant that she should.\\nhe had not been known to them as a boy; but soon after lady elliot\\'s death,\\nsir walter had sought the acquaintance, and though his overtures\\nhad not been met with any warmth, he had persevered in seeking it,\\nmaking allowance for the modest drawing-back of youth; and, in one of\\ntheir spring excursions to london, when elizabeth was in her first bloom,\\nmr elliot had been forced into the introduction.\\n\\nhe was at that time a very young man, just engaged in the study of the law;\\nand elizabeth found him extremely agreeable, and every plan in his favour\\nwas confirmed.  he was invited to kellynch hall; he was talked of\\nand expected all the rest of the year; but he never came.\\nthe following spring he was seen again in town, found equally agreeable,\\nagain encouraged, invited, and expected, and again he did not come;\\nand the next tidings were that he was married.  instead of pushing\\nhis fortune in the line marked out for the heir of the house of elliot,\\nhe had purchased independence by uniting himself to a rich woman\\nof inferior birth.\\n\\nsir walter has resented it.  as the head of the house, he felt that\\nhe ought to have been consulted, especially after taking the young man\\nso publicly by the hand; \"for they must have been seen together,\"\\nhe observed, \"once at tattersall\\'s, and twice in the lobby of\\nthe house of commons.\"  his disapprobation was expressed,\\nbut apparently very little regarded.  mr elliot had attempted no apology,\\nand shewn himself as unsolicitous of being longer noticed by the family,\\nas sir walter considered him unworthy of it:  all acquaintance between\\nthem had ceased.\\n\\nthis very awkward history of mr elliot was still, after an interval\\nof several years, felt with anger by elizabeth, who had liked the man\\nfor himself, and still more for being her father\\'s heir, and whose\\nstrong family pride could see only in him a proper match for sir walter\\nelliot\\'s eldest daughter.  there was not a baronet from a to z whom\\nher feelings could have so willingly acknowledged as an equal.\\nyet so miserably had he conducted himself, that though she was\\nat this present time (the summer of 1814) wearing black ribbons\\nfor his wife, she could not admit him to be worth thinking of again.\\nthe disgrace of his first marriage might, perhaps, as there was\\nno reason to suppose it perpetuated by offspring, have been got over,\\nhad he not done worse; but he had, as by the accustomary intervention\\nof kind friends, they had been informed, spoken most disrespectfully\\nof them all, most slightingly and contemptuously of the very blood\\nhe belonged to, and the honours which were hereafter to be his own.\\nthis could not be pardoned.\\n\\nsuch were elizabeth elliot\\'s sentiments and sensations; such the cares\\nto alloy, the agitations to vary, the sameness and the elegance,\\nthe prosperity and the nothingness of her scene of life;\\nsuch the feelings to give interest to a long, uneventful residence\\nin one country circle, to fill the vacancies which there were no habits\\nof utility abroad, no talents or accomplishments for home, to occupy.\\n\\nbut now, another occupation and solicitude of mind was beginning to be\\nadded to these.  her father was growing distressed for money.\\nshe knew, that when he now took up the baronetage, it was to drive\\nthe heavy bills of his tradespeople, and the unwelcome hints of\\nmr shepherd, his agent, from his thoughts.  the kellynch property was good,\\nbut not equal to sir walter\\'s apprehension of the state required\\nin its possessor.  while lady elliot lived, there had been method,\\nmoderation, and economy, which had just kept him within his income;\\nbut with her had died all such right-mindedness, and from that period\\nhe had been constantly exceeding it.  it had not been possible\\nfor him to spend less; he had done nothing but what sir walter elliot\\nwas imperiously called on to do; but blameless as he was, he was\\nnot only growing dreadfully in debt, but was hearing of it so often,\\nthat it became vain to attempt concealing it longer, even partially,\\nfrom his daughter.  he had given her some hints of it the last spring\\nin town; he had gone so far even as to say, \"can we retrench?\\ndoes it occur to you that there is any one article in which\\nwe can retrench?\" and elizabeth, to do her justice, had, in the first\\nardour of female alarm, set seriously to think what could be done,\\nand had finally proposed these two branches of economy, to cut off\\nsome unnecessary charities, and to refrain from new furnishing\\nthe drawing-room; to which expedients she afterwards added\\nthe happy thought of their taking no present down to anne,\\nas had been the usual yearly custom.  but these measures,\\nhowever good in themselves, were insufficient for the real extent\\nof the evil, the whole of which sir walter found himself obliged\\nto confess to her soon afterwards.  elizabeth had nothing to propose\\nof deeper efficacy.  she felt herself ill-used and unfortunate,\\nas did her father; and they were neither of them able to devise\\nany means of lessening their expenses without compromising their dignity,\\nor relinquishing their comforts in a way not to be borne.\\n\\nthere was only a small part of his estate that sir walter could dispose of;\\nbut had every acre been alienable, it would have made no difference.\\nhe had condescended to mortgage as far as he had the power,\\nbut he would never condescend to sell.  no; he would never disgrace\\nhis name so far.  the kellynch estate should be transmitted whole\\nand entire, as he had received it.\\n\\ntheir two confidential friends, mr shepherd, who lived in\\nthe neighbouring market town, and lady russell, were called to advise them;\\nand both father and daughter seemed to expect that something should be\\nstruck out by one or the other to remove their embarrassments\\nand reduce their expenditure, without involving the loss of\\nany indulgence of taste or pride.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 2\\n\\n\\nmr shepherd, a civil, cautious lawyer, who, whatever might be his hold\\nor his views on sir walter, would rather have the disagreeable\\nprompted by anybody else, excused himself from offering the slightest hint,\\nand only begged leave to recommend an implicit reference to\\nthe excellent judgement of lady russell, from whose known good sense\\nhe fully expected to have just such resolute measures advised as\\nhe meant to see finally adopted.\\n\\nlady russell was most anxiously zealous on the subject, and gave it\\nmuch serious consideration.  she was a woman rather of sound than of\\nquick abilities, whose difficulties in coming to any decision\\nin this instance were great, from the opposition of two leading principles.\\nshe was of strict integrity herself, with a delicate sense of honour;\\nbut she was as desirous of saving sir walter\\'s feelings, as solicitous\\nfor the credit of the family, as aristocratic in her ideas of what\\nwas due to them, as anybody of sense and honesty could well be.\\nshe was a benevolent, charitable, good woman, and capable of\\nstrong attachments, most correct in her conduct, strict in her notions\\nof decorum, and with manners that were held a standard of good-breeding.\\nshe had a cultivated mind, and was, generally speaking,\\nrational and consistent; but she had prejudices on the side of ancestry;\\nshe had a value for rank and consequence, which blinded her a little\\nto the faults of those who possessed them.  herself the widow of\\nonly a knight, she gave the dignity of a baronet all its due;\\nand sir walter, independent of his claims as an old acquaintance,\\nan attentive neighbour, an obliging landlord, the husband of her\\nvery dear friend, the father of anne and her sisters, was,\\nas being sir walter, in her apprehension, entitled to a great deal\\nof compassion and consideration under his present difficulties.\\n\\nthey must retrench; that did not admit of a doubt.  but she was\\nvery anxious to have it done with the least possible pain to him\\nand elizabeth. she drew up plans of economy, she made exact calculations,\\nand she did what nobody else thought of doing:  she consulted anne,\\nwho never seemed considered by the others as having any interest\\nin the question. she consulted, and in a degree was influenced by her\\nin marking out the scheme of retrenchment which was at last submitted\\nto sir walter. every emendation of anne\\'s had been on the side of\\nhonesty against importance.  she wanted more vigorous measures,\\na more complete reformation, a quicker release from debt,\\na much higher tone of indifference for everything but justice and equity.\\n\\n\"if we can persuade your father to all this,\" said lady russell,\\nlooking over her paper, \"much may be done.  if he will adopt\\nthese regulations, in seven years he will be clear; and i hope\\nwe may be able to convince him and elizabeth, that kellynch hall has\\na respectability in itself which cannot be affected by these reductions;\\nand that the true dignity of sir walter elliot will be very far from\\nlessened in the eyes of sensible people, by acting like a man of principle.\\nwhat will he be doing, in fact, but what very many of our first families\\nhave done, or ought to do?  there will be nothing singular in his case;\\nand it is singularity which often makes the worst part of our suffering,\\nas it always does of our conduct.  i have great hope of prevailing.\\nwe must be serious and decided; for after all, the person who\\nhas contracted debts must pay them; and though a great deal is due to\\nthe feelings of the gentleman, and the head of a house, like your father,\\nthere is still more due to the character of an honest man.\"\\n\\nthis was the principle on which anne wanted her father to be proceeding,\\nhis friends to be urging him.  she considered it as an act\\nof indispensable duty to clear away the claims of creditors with\\nall the expedition which the most comprehensive retrenchments\\ncould secure, and saw no dignity in anything short of it.\\nshe wanted it to be prescribed, and felt as a duty.  she rated\\nlady russell\\'s influence highly; and as to the severe degree\\nof self-denial which her own conscience prompted, she believed\\nthere might be little more difficulty in persuading them to a complete,\\nthan to half a reformation.  her knowledge of her father\\nand elizabeth inclined her to think that the sacrifice of one pair\\nof horses would be hardly less painful than of both, and so on,\\nthrough the whole list of lady russell\\'s too gentle reductions.\\n\\nhow anne\\'s more rigid requisitions might have been taken\\nis of little consequence.  lady russell\\'s had no success at all:\\ncould not be put up with, were not to be borne. \"what! every comfort\\nof life knocked off!  journeys, london, servants, horses, table--\\ncontractions and restrictions every where!  to live no longer\\nwith the decencies even of a private gentleman!  no, he would sooner\\nquit kellynch hall at once, than remain in it on such disgraceful terms.\"\\n\\n\"quit kellynch hall.\"  the hint was immediately taken up by mr shepherd,\\nwhose interest was involved in the reality of sir walter\\'s retrenching,\\nand who was perfectly persuaded that nothing would be done without\\na change of abode.  \"since the idea had been started in the very quarter\\nwhich ought to dictate, he had no scruple,\" he said, \"in confessing\\nhis judgement to be entirely on that side.  it did not appear to him\\nthat sir walter could materially alter his style of living in a house\\nwhich had such a character of hospitality and ancient dignity to support.\\nin any other place sir walter might judge for himself; and would\\nbe looked up to, as regulating the modes of life in whatever way\\nhe might choose to model his household.\"\\n\\nsir walter would quit kellynch hall; and after a very few days more\\nof doubt and indecision, the great question of whither he should go\\nwas settled, and the first outline of this important change made out.\\n\\nthere had been three alternatives, london, bath, or another house\\nin the country.  all anne\\'s wishes had been for the latter.\\na small house in their own neighbourhood, where they might still have\\nlady russell\\'s society, still be near mary, and still have the pleasure\\nof sometimes seeing the lawns and groves of kellynch, was the object\\nof her ambition.  but the usual fate of anne attended her,\\nin having something very opposite from her inclination fixed on.\\nshe disliked bath, and did not think it agreed with her;\\nand bath was to be her home.\\n\\nsir walter had at first thought more of london; but mr shepherd felt\\nthat he could not be trusted in london, and had been skilful enough\\nto dissuade him from it, and make bath preferred.  it was a much safer\\nplace for a gentleman in his predicament:  he might there be important\\nat comparatively little expense.  two material advantages of bath\\nover london had of course been given all their weight:  its more convenient\\ndistance from kellynch, only fifty miles, and lady russell\\'s spending\\nsome part of every winter there; and to the very great satisfaction\\nof lady russell, whose first views on the projected change had been\\nfor bath, sir walter and elizabeth were induced to believe that\\nthey should lose neither consequence nor enjoyment by settling there.\\n\\nlady russell felt obliged to oppose her dear anne\\'s known wishes.\\nit would be too much to expect sir walter to descend into a small house\\nin his own neighbourhood.  anne herself would have found\\nthe mortifications of it more than she foresaw, and to sir walter\\'s\\nfeelings they must have been dreadful.  and with regard to anne\\'s\\ndislike of bath, she considered it as a prejudice and mistake arising,\\nfirst, from the circumstance of her having been three years\\nat school there, after her mother\\'s death; and secondly,\\nfrom her happening to be not in perfectly good spirits the only winter\\nwhich she had afterwards spent there with herself.\\n\\nlady russell was fond of bath, in short, and disposed to think\\nit must suit them all; and as to her young friend\\'s health,\\nby passing all the warm months with her at kellynch lodge,\\nevery danger would be avoided; and it was in fact, a change which must\\ndo both health and spirits good.  anne had been too little from home,\\ntoo little seen. her spirits were not high.  a larger society\\nwould improve them.  she wanted her to be more known.\\n\\nthe undesirableness of any other house in the same neighbourhood\\nfor sir walter was certainly much strengthened by one part,\\nand a very material part of the scheme, which had been happily\\nengrafted on the beginning.  he was not only to quit his home,\\nbut to see it in the hands of others; a trial of fortitude,\\nwhich stronger heads than sir walter\\'s have found too much.\\nkellynch hall was to be let.  this, however, was a profound secret,\\nnot to be breathed beyond their own circle.\\n\\nsir walter could not have borne the degradation of being known\\nto design letting his house.  mr shepherd had once mentioned the word\\n\"advertise,\" but never dared approach it again.  sir walter spurned\\nthe idea of its being offered in any manner; forbad the slightest hint\\nbeing dropped of his having such an intention; and it was only on\\nthe supposition of his being spontaneously solicited by some most\\nunexceptionable applicant, on his own terms, and as a great favour,\\nthat he would let it at all.\\n\\nhow quick come the reasons for approving what we like!  lady russell had\\nanother excellent one at hand, for being extremely glad that sir walter\\nand his family were to remove from the country.  elizabeth had been\\nlately forming an intimacy, which she wished to see interrupted.\\nit was with the daughter of mr shepherd, who had returned,\\nafter an unprosperous marriage, to her father\\'s house, with\\nthe additional burden of two children.  she was a clever young woman,\\nwho understood the art of pleasing--the art of pleasing, at least,\\nat kellynch hall; and who had made herself so acceptable to miss elliot,\\nas to have been already staying there more than once, in spite of all\\nthat lady russell, who thought it a friendship quite out of place,\\ncould hint of caution and reserve.\\n\\nlady russell, indeed, had scarcely any influence with elizabeth,\\nand seemed to love her, rather because she would love her,\\nthan because elizabeth deserved it.  she had never received from her more\\nthan outward attention, nothing beyond the observances of complaisance;\\nhad never succeeded in any point which she wanted to carry,\\nagainst previous inclination.  she had been repeatedly very earnest\\nin trying to get anne included in the visit to london, sensibly open\\nto all the injustice and all the discredit of the selfish arrangements\\nwhich shut her out, and on many lesser occasions had endeavoured\\nto give elizabeth the advantage of her own better judgement and experience;\\nbut always in vain:  elizabeth would go her own way; and never had she\\npursued it in more decided opposition to lady russell than in\\nthis selection of mrs clay; turning from the society of so deserving\\na sister, to bestow her affection and confidence on one who ought\\nto have been nothing to her but the object of distant civility.\\n\\nfrom situation, mrs clay was, in lady russell\\'s estimate, a very unequal,\\nand in her character she believed a very dangerous companion;\\nand a removal that would leave mrs clay behind, and bring a choice\\nof more suitable intimates within miss elliot\\'s reach, was therefore\\nan object of first-rate importance.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 3\\n\\n\\n\"i must take leave to observe, sir walter,\" said mr shepherd\\none morning at kellynch hall, as he laid down the newspaper,\\n\"that the present juncture is much in our favour.  this peace will\\nbe turning all our rich naval officers ashore.  they will be\\nall wanting a home.  could not be a better time, sir walter,\\nfor having a choice of tenants, very responsible tenants.\\nmany a noble fortune has been made during the war.  if a rich admiral\\nwere to come in our way, sir walter--\"\\n\\n\"he would be a very lucky man, shepherd,\" replied sir walter;\\n\"that\\'s all i have to remark.  a prize indeed would kellynch hall\\nbe to him; rather the greatest prize of all, let him have taken\\never so many before; hey, shepherd?\"\\n\\nmr shepherd laughed, as he knew he must, at this wit, and then added--\\n\\n\"i presume to observe, sir walter, that, in the way of business,\\ngentlemen of the navy are well to deal with.  i have had a little knowledge\\nof their methods of doing business; and i am free to confess that they\\nhave very liberal notions, and are as likely to make desirable tenants\\nas any set of people one should meet with.  therefore, sir walter,\\nwhat i would take leave to suggest is, that if in consequence of\\nany rumours getting abroad of your intention; which must be contemplated\\nas a possible thing, because we know how difficult it is to keep\\nthe actions and designs of one part of the world from the notice\\nand curiosity of the other; consequence has its tax; i, john shepherd,\\nmight conceal any family-matters that i chose, for nobody would think it\\nworth their while to observe me; but sir walter elliot has eyes upon him\\nwhich it may be very difficult to elude; and therefore, thus much\\ni venture upon, that it will not greatly surprise me if,\\nwith all our caution, some rumour of the truth should get abroad;\\nin the supposition of which, as i was going to observe, since applications\\nwill unquestionably follow, i should think any from our wealthy\\nnaval commanders particularly worth attending to; and beg leave to add,\\nthat two hours will bring me over at any time, to save you\\nthe trouble of replying.\"\\n\\nsir walter only nodded.  but soon afterwards, rising and pacing the room,\\nhe observed sarcastically--\\n\\n\"there are few among the gentlemen of the navy, i imagine, who would\\nnot be surprised to find themselves in a house of this description.\"\\n\\n\"they would look around them, no doubt, and bless their good fortune,\"\\nsaid mrs clay, for mrs clay was present:  her father had driven her over,\\nnothing being of so much use to mrs clay\\'s health as a drive to kellynch:\\n\"but i quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might be\\na very desirable tenant.  i have known a good deal of the profession;\\nand besides their liberality, they are so neat and careful\\nin all their ways!  these valuable pictures of yours, sir walter,\\nif you chose to leave them, would be perfectly safe.  everything in\\nand about the house would be taken such excellent care of!\\nthe gardens and shrubberies would be kept in almost as high order\\nas they are now.  you need not be afraid, miss elliot, of your own\\nsweet flower gardens being neglected.\"\\n\\n\"as to all that,\" rejoined sir walter coolly, \"supposing i were induced\\nto let my house, i have by no means made up my mind as to the privileges\\nto be annexed to it.  i am not particularly disposed to favour a tenant.\\nthe park would be open to him of course, and few navy officers,\\nor men of any other description, can have had such a range;\\nbut what restrictions i might impose on the use of the pleasure-grounds,\\nis another thing.  i am not fond of the idea of my shrubberies being\\nalways approachable; and i should recommend miss elliot to be on her guard\\nwith respect to her flower garden.  i am very little disposed\\nto grant a tenant of kellynch hall any extraordinary favour,\\ni assure you, be he sailor or soldier.\"\\n\\nafter a short pause, mr shepherd presumed to say--\\n\\n\"in all these cases, there are established usages which\\nmake everything plain and easy between landlord and tenant.\\nyour interest, sir walter, is in pretty safe hands.  depend upon me\\nfor taking care that no tenant has more than his just rights.\\ni venture to hint, that sir walter elliot cannot be half so jealous\\nfor his own, as john shepherd will be for him.\"\\n\\nhere anne spoke--\\n\\n\"the navy, i think, who have done so much for us, have at least\\nan equal claim with any other set of men, for all the comforts and\\nall the privileges which any home can give.  sailors work hard enough\\nfor their comforts, we must all allow.\"\\n\\n\"very true, very true.  what miss anne says, is very true,\"\\nwas mr shepherd\\'s rejoinder, and \"oh! certainly,\" was his daughter\\'s;\\nbut sir walter\\'s remark was, soon afterwards--\\n\\n\"the profession has its utility, but i should be sorry to see\\nany friend of mine belonging to it.\"\\n\\n\"indeed!\" was the reply, and with a look of surprise.\\n\\n\"yes; it is in two points offensive to me; i have two strong grounds\\nof objection to it.  first, as being the means of bringing persons\\nof obscure birth into undue distinction, and raising men to honours\\nwhich their fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of; and secondly,\\nas it cuts up a man\\'s youth and vigour most horribly; a sailor grows old\\nsooner than any other man.  i have observed it all my life.\\na man is in greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise\\nof one whose father, his father might have disdained to speak to,\\nand of becoming prematurely an object of disgust himself, than in\\nany other line.  one day last spring, in town, i was in company\\nwith two men, striking instances of what i am talking of;\\nlord st ives, whose father we all know to have been a country curate,\\nwithout bread to eat; i was to give place to lord st ives,\\nand a certain admiral baldwin, the most deplorable-looking personage\\nyou can imagine; his face the colour of mahogany, rough and rugged\\nto the last degree; all lines and wrinkles, nine grey hairs of a side,\\nand nothing but a dab of powder at top.  `in the name of heaven,\\nwho is that old fellow?\\' said i to a friend of mine who was standing near,\\n(sir basil morley).  `old fellow!\\' cried sir basil, `it is admiral baldwin.\\nwhat do you take his age to be?\\'  `sixty,\\' said i, `or perhaps sixty-two.\\'\\n`forty,\\' replied sir basil, `forty, and no more.\\'  picture to yourselves\\nmy amazement; i shall not easily forget admiral baldwin.\\ni never saw quite so wretched an example of what a sea-faring life can do;\\nbut to a degree, i know it is the same with them all:  they are all\\nknocked about, and exposed to every climate, and every weather,\\ntill they are not fit to be seen.  it is a pity they are not knocked\\non the head at once, before they reach admiral baldwin\\'s age.\"\\n\\n\"nay, sir walter,\" cried mrs clay, \"this is being severe indeed.\\nhave a little mercy on the poor men.  we are not all born to be handsome.\\nthe sea is no beautifier, certainly; sailors do grow old betimes;\\ni have observed it; they soon lose the look of youth.  but then,\\nis not it the same with many other professions, perhaps most other?\\nsoldiers, in active service, are not at all better off:  and even in\\nthe quieter professions, there is a toil and a labour of the mind,\\nif not of the body, which seldom leaves a man\\'s looks to the natural\\neffect of time.  the lawyer plods, quite care-worn; the physician\\nis up at all hours, and travelling in all weather; and even\\nthe clergyman--\" she stopt a moment to consider what might\\ndo for the clergyman;--\"and even the clergyman, you know is obliged\\nto go into infected rooms, and expose his health and looks to\\nall the injury of a poisonous atmosphere.  in fact, as i have\\nlong been convinced, though every profession is necessary and honourable\\nin its turn, it is only the lot of those who are not obliged to follow any,\\nwho can live in a regular way, in the country, choosing their own hours,\\nfollowing their own pursuits, and living on their own property,\\nwithout the torment of trying for more; it is only their lot, i say,\\nto hold the blessings of health and a good appearance to the utmost:\\ni know no other set of men but what lose something of their personableness\\nwhen they cease to be quite young.\"\\n\\nit seemed as if mr shepherd, in this anxiety to bespeak\\nsir walter\\'s good will towards a naval officer as tenant,\\nhad been gifted with foresight; for the very first application\\nfor the house was from an admiral croft, with whom he shortly afterwards\\nfell into company in attending the quarter sessions at taunton; and indeed,\\nhe had received a hint of the admiral from a london correspondent.\\nby the report which he hastened over to kellynch to make,\\nadmiral croft was a native of somersetshire, who having acquired\\na very handsome fortune, was wishing to settle in his own country,\\nand had come down to taunton in order to look at some advertised places\\nin that immediate neighbourhood, which, however, had not suited him;\\nthat accidentally hearing--(it was just as he had foretold,\\nmr shepherd observed, sir walter\\'s concerns could not be kept a secret,)--\\naccidentally hearing of the possibility of kellynch hall being to let,\\nand understanding his (mr shepherd\\'s) connection with the owner,\\nhe had introduced himself to him in order to make particular inquiries,\\nand had, in the course of a pretty long conference, expressed as strong\\nan inclination for the place as a man who knew it only by description\\ncould feel; and given mr shepherd, in his explicit account of himself,\\nevery proof of his being a most responsible, eligible tenant.\\n\\n\"and who is admiral croft?\" was sir walter\\'s cold suspicious inquiry.\\n\\nmr shepherd answered for his being of a gentleman\\'s family,\\nand mentioned a place; and anne, after the little pause which followed,\\nadded--\\n\\n\"he is a rear admiral of the white.  he was in the trafalgar action,\\nand has been in the east indies since; he was stationed there,\\ni believe, several years.\"\\n\\n\"then i take it for granted,\" observed sir walter, \"that his face\\nis about as orange as the cuffs and capes of my livery.\"\\n\\nmr shepherd hastened to assure him, that admiral croft was a very hale,\\nhearty, well-looking man, a little weather-beaten, to be sure,\\nbut not much, and quite the gentleman in all his notions and behaviour;\\nnot likely to make the smallest difficulty about terms, only wanted\\na comfortable home, and to get into it as soon as possible;\\nknew he must pay for his convenience; knew what rent a ready-furnished\\nhouse of that consequence might fetch; should not have been surprised\\nif sir walter had asked more; had inquired about the manor;\\nwould be glad of the deputation, certainly, but made no great point of it;\\nsaid he sometimes took out a gun, but never killed; quite the gentleman.\\n\\nmr shepherd was eloquent on the subject; pointing out all\\nthe circumstances of the admiral\\'s family, which made him\\npeculiarly desirable as a tenant.  he was a married man,\\nand without children; the very state to be wished for.  a house was\\nnever taken good care of, mr shepherd observed, without a lady:\\nhe did not know, whether furniture might not be in danger of suffering\\nas much where there was no lady, as where there were many children.\\na lady, without a family, was the very best preserver of furniture\\nin the world.  he had seen mrs croft, too; she was at taunton\\nwith the admiral, and had been present almost all the time they were\\ntalking the matter over.\\n\\n\"and a very well-spoken, genteel, shrewd lady, she seemed to be,\"\\ncontinued he; \"asked more questions about the house, and terms,\\nand taxes, than the admiral himself, and seemed more conversant\\nwith business; and moreover, sir walter, i found she was not quite\\nunconnected in this country, any more than her husband; that is to say,\\nshe is sister to a gentleman who did live amongst us once;\\nshe told me so herself:  sister to the gentleman who lived\\na few years back at monkford.  bless me! what was his name?\\nat this moment i cannot recollect his name, though i have heard it so lately.\\npenelope, my dear, can you help me to the name of the gentleman\\nwho lived at monkford:  mrs croft\\'s brother?\"\\n\\nbut mrs clay was talking so eagerly with miss elliot, that she did not\\nhear the appeal.\\n\\n\"i have no conception whom you can mean, shepherd; i remember\\nno gentleman resident at monkford since the time of old governor trent.\"\\n\\n\"bless me! how very odd!  i shall forget my own name soon, i suppose.\\na name that i am so very well acquainted with; knew the gentleman\\nso well by sight; seen him a hundred times; came to consult me once,\\ni remember, about a trespass of one of his neighbours; farmer\\'s man\\nbreaking into his orchard; wall torn down; apples stolen;\\ncaught in the fact; and afterwards, contrary to my judgement,\\nsubmitted to an amicable compromise.  very odd indeed!\"\\n\\nafter waiting another moment--\\n\\n\"you mean mr wentworth, i suppose?\" said anne.\\n\\nmr shepherd was all gratitude.\\n\\n\"wentworth was the very name!  mr wentworth was the very man.\\nhe had the curacy of monkford, you know, sir walter, some time back,\\nfor two or three years.  came there about the year ---5, i take it.\\nyou remember him, i am sure.\"\\n\\n\"wentworth?  oh! ay,--mr wentworth, the curate of monkford.\\nyou misled me by the term gentleman.  i thought you were speaking of\\nsome man of property:  mr wentworth was nobody, i remember;\\nquite unconnected; nothing to do with the strafford family.\\none wonders how the names of many of our nobility become so common.\"\\n\\nas mr shepherd perceived that this connexion of the crofts did them\\nno service with sir walter, he mentioned it no more; returning,\\nwith all his zeal, to dwell on the circumstances more indisputably\\nin their favour; their age, and number, and fortune; the high idea\\nthey had formed of kellynch hall, and extreme solicitude for\\nthe advantage of renting it; making it appear as if they ranked\\nnothing beyond the happiness of being the tenants of sir walter elliot:\\nan extraordinary taste, certainly, could they have been supposed in\\nthe secret of sir walter\\'s estimate of the dues of a tenant.\\n\\nit succeeded, however; and though sir walter must ever look with\\nan evil eye on anyone intending to inhabit that house, and think them\\ninfinitely too well off in being permitted to rent it on the highest terms,\\nhe was talked into allowing mr shepherd to proceed in the treaty,\\nand authorising him to wait on admiral croft, who still remained\\nat taunton, and fix a day for the house being seen.\\n\\nsir walter was not very wise; but still he had experience enough\\nof the world to feel, that a more unobjectionable tenant,\\nin all essentials, than admiral croft bid fair to be, could hardly offer.\\nso far went his understanding; and his vanity supplied a little\\nadditional soothing, in the admiral\\'s situation in life, which was just\\nhigh enough, and not too high.  \"i have let my house to admiral croft,\"\\nwould sound extremely well; very much better than to any mere mr--;\\na mr (save, perhaps, some half dozen in the nation,) always needs\\na note of explanation.  an admiral speaks his own consequence,\\nand, at the same time, can never make a baronet look small.\\nin all their dealings and intercourse, sir walter elliot must ever\\nhave the precedence.\\n\\nnothing could be done without a reference to elizabeth:\\nbut her inclination was growing so strong for a removal,\\nthat she was happy to have it fixed and expedited by a tenant at hand;\\nand not a word to suspend decision was uttered by her.\\n\\nmr shepherd was completely empowered to act; and no sooner had\\nsuch an end been reached, than anne, who had been a most attentive listener\\nto the whole, left the room, to seek the comfort of cool air for her\\nflushed cheeks; and as she walked along a favourite grove, said,\\nwith a gentle sigh, \"a few months more, and he, perhaps,\\nmay be walking here.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 4\\n\\n\\nhe was not mr wentworth, the former curate of monkford,\\nhowever suspicious appearances may be, but a captain frederick wentworth,\\nhis brother, who being made commander in consequence of the action\\noff st domingo, and not immediately employed, had come into somersetshire,\\nin the summer of 1806; and having no parent living, found a home\\nfor half a year at monkford.  he was, at that time, a remarkably fine\\nyoung man, with a great deal of intelligence, spirit, and brilliancy;\\nand anne an extremely pretty girl, with gentleness, modesty, taste,\\nand feeling.  half the sum of attraction, on either side, might have\\nbeen enough, for he had nothing to do, and she had hardly anybody to love;\\nbut the encounter of such lavish recommendations could not fail.\\nthey were gradually acquainted, and when acquainted, rapidly and\\ndeeply in love.  it would be difficult to say which had seen\\nhighest perfection in the other, or which had been the happiest:\\nshe, in receiving his declarations and proposals, or he in\\nhaving them accepted.\\n\\na short period of exquisite felicity followed, and but a short one.\\ntroubles soon arose.  sir walter, on being applied to, without actually\\nwithholding his consent, or saying it should never be, gave it all\\nthe negative of great astonishment, great coldness, great silence,\\nand a professed resolution of doing nothing for his daughter.\\nhe thought it a very degrading alliance; and lady russell, though with\\nmore tempered and pardonable pride, received it as a most unfortunate one.\\n\\nanne elliot, with all her claims of birth, beauty, and mind,\\nto throw herself away at nineteen; involve herself at nineteen\\nin an engagement with a young man, who had nothing but himself\\nto recommend him, and no hopes of attaining affluence, but in the chances\\nof a most uncertain profession, and no connexions to secure\\neven his farther rise in the profession, would be, indeed, a throwing away,\\nwhich she grieved to think of!  anne elliot, so young; known to so few,\\nto be snatched off by a stranger without alliance or fortune;\\nor rather sunk by him into a state of most wearing, anxious,\\nyouth-killing dependence!  it must not be, if by any fair interference\\nof friendship, any representations from one who had almost a mother\\'s love,\\nand mother\\'s rights, it would be prevented.\\n\\ncaptain wentworth had no fortune.  he had been lucky in his profession;\\nbut spending freely, what had come freely, had realized nothing.\\nbut he was confident that he should soon be rich:\\nfull of life and ardour, he knew that he should soon have a ship,\\nand soon be on a station that would lead to everything he wanted.\\nhe had always been lucky; he knew he should be so still.\\nsuch confidence, powerful in its own warmth, and bewitching in\\nthe wit which often expressed it, must have been enough for anne;\\nbut lady russell saw it very differently.  his sanguine temper,\\nand fearlessness of mind, operated very differently on her.\\nshe saw in it but an aggravation of the evil.  it only added a\\ndangerous character to himself.  he was brilliant, he was headstrong.\\nlady russell had little taste for wit, and of anything approaching\\nto imprudence a horror.  she deprecated the connexion in every light.\\n\\nsuch opposition, as these feelings produced, was more than\\nanne could combat.  young and gentle as she was, it might yet\\nhave been possible to withstand her father\\'s ill-will,\\nthough unsoftened by one kind word or look on the part of her sister;\\nbut lady russell, whom she had always loved and relied on, could not,\\nwith such steadiness of opinion, and such tenderness of manner,\\nbe continually advising her in vain.  she was persuaded to believe\\nthe engagement a wrong thing:  indiscreet, improper, hardly capable\\nof success, and not deserving it.  but it was not a merely selfish caution,\\nunder which she acted, in putting an end to it.  had she not\\nimagined herself consulting his good, even more than her own,\\nshe could hardly have given him up.  the belief of being prudent,\\nand self-denying, principally for his advantage, was her chief consolation,\\nunder the misery of a parting, a final parting; and every consolation\\nwas required, for she had to encounter all the additional pain of opinions,\\non his side, totally unconvinced and unbending, and of his feeling himself\\nill used by so forced a relinquishment.  he had left the country\\nin consequence.\\n\\na few months had seen the beginning and the end of their acquaintance;\\nbut not with a few months ended anne\\'s share of suffering from it.\\nher attachment and regrets had, for a long time, clouded every\\nenjoyment of youth, and an early loss of bloom and spirits\\nhad been their lasting effect.\\n\\nmore than seven years were gone since this little history\\nof sorrowful interest had reached its close; and time had\\nsoftened down much, perhaps nearly all of peculiar attachment to him,\\nbut she had been too dependent on time alone; no aid had been given\\nin change of place (except in one visit to bath soon after the rupture),\\nor in any novelty or enlargement of society.  no one had ever\\ncome within the kellynch circle, who could bear a comparison with\\nfrederick wentworth, as he stood in her memory.  no second attachment,\\nthe only thoroughly natural, happy, and sufficient cure,\\nat her time of life, had been possible to the nice tone of her mind,\\nthe fastidiousness of her taste, in the small limits of the society\\naround them.  she had been solicited, when about two-and-twenty,\\nto change her name, by the young man, who not long afterwards found\\na more willing mind in her younger sister; and lady russell had\\nlamented her refusal; for charles musgrove was the eldest son of a man,\\nwhose landed property and general importance were second in that country,\\nonly to sir walter\\'s, and of good character and appearance;\\nand however lady russell might have asked yet for something more,\\nwhile anne was nineteen, she would have rejoiced to see her at twenty-two\\nso respectably removed from the partialities and injustice of\\nher father\\'s house, and settled so permanently near herself.\\nbut in this case, anne had left nothing for advice to do;\\nand though lady russell, as satisfied as ever with her own discretion,\\nnever wished the past undone, she began now to have the anxiety\\nwhich borders on hopelessness for anne\\'s being tempted, by some man\\nof talents and independence, to enter a state for which she held her\\nto be peculiarly fitted by her warm affections and domestic habits.\\n\\nthey knew not each other\\'s opinion, either its constancy or its change,\\non the one leading point of anne\\'s conduct, for the subject was never\\nalluded to; but anne, at seven-and-twenty, thought very differently\\nfrom what she had been made to think at nineteen.  she did not blame\\nlady russell, she did not blame herself for having been guided by her;\\nbut she felt that were any young person, in similar circumstances,\\nto apply to her for counsel, they would never receive any of such\\ncertain immediate wretchedness, such uncertain future good.\\nshe was persuaded that under every disadvantage of disapprobation at home,\\nand every anxiety attending his profession, all their probable fears,\\ndelays, and disappointments, she should yet have been a happier woman\\nin maintaining the engagement, than she had been in the sacrifice of it;\\nand this, she fully believed, had the usual share, had even more than\\nthe usual share of all such solicitudes and suspense been theirs,\\nwithout reference to the actual results of their case, which,\\nas it happened, would have bestowed earlier prosperity than\\ncould be reasonably calculated on.  all his sanguine expectations,\\nall his confidence had been justified.  his genius and ardour\\nhad seemed to foresee and to command his prosperous path.\\nhe had, very soon after their engagement ceased, got employ:\\nand all that he had told her would follow, had taken place.\\nhe had distinguished himself, and early gained the other step in rank,\\nand must now, by successive captures, have made a handsome fortune.\\nshe had only navy lists and newspapers for her authority,\\nbut she could not doubt his being rich; and, in favour of his constancy,\\nshe had no reason to believe him married.\\n\\nhow eloquent could anne elliot have been! how eloquent, at least,\\nwere her wishes on the side of early warm attachment, and a cheerful\\nconfidence in futurity, against that over-anxious caution which\\nseems to insult exertion and distrust providence!  she had been forced\\ninto prudence in her youth, she learned romance as she grew older:\\nthe natural sequel of an unnatural beginning.\\n\\nwith all these circumstances, recollections and feelings,\\nshe could not hear that captain wentworth\\'s sister was likely\\nto live at kellynch without a revival of former pain; and many a stroll,\\nand many a sigh, were necessary to dispel the agitation of the idea.\\nshe often told herself it was folly, before she could harden her nerves\\nsufficiently to feel the continual discussion of the crofts\\nand their business no evil.  she was assisted, however, by that\\nperfect indifference and apparent unconsciousness, among the only three\\nof her own friends in the secret of the past, which seemed almost to deny\\nany recollection of it.  she could do justice to the superiority\\nof lady russell\\'s motives in this, over those of her father and elizabeth;\\nshe could honour all the better feelings of her calmness;\\nbut the general air of oblivion among them was highly important\\nfrom whatever it sprung; and in the event of admiral croft\\'s really\\ntaking kellynch hall, she rejoiced anew over the conviction which\\nhad always been most grateful to her, of the past being known to\\nthose three only among her connexions, by whom no syllable,\\nshe believed, would ever be whispered, and in the trust that among his,\\nthe brother only with whom he had been residing, had received\\nany information of their short-lived engagement.  that brother had been\\nlong removed from the country and being a sensible man, and, moreover,\\na single man at the time, she had a fond dependence on no human creature\\'s\\nhaving heard of it from him.\\n\\nthe sister, mrs croft, had then been out of england, accompanying\\nher husband on a foreign station, and her own sister, mary,\\nhad been at school while it all occurred; and never admitted by\\nthe pride of some, and the delicacy of others, to the smallest knowledge\\nof it afterwards.\\n\\nwith these supports, she hoped that the acquaintance between herself\\nand the crofts, which, with lady russell, still resident in kellynch,\\nand mary fixed only three miles off, must be anticipated,\\nneed not involve any particular awkwardness.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 5\\n\\n\\non the morning appointed for admiral and mrs croft\\'s seeing kellynch hall,\\nanne found it most natural to take her almost daily walk to lady russell\\'s,\\nand keep out of the way till all was over; when she found it most natural\\nto be sorry that she had missed the opportunity of seeing them.\\n\\nthis meeting of the two parties proved highly satisfactory,\\nand decided the whole business at once.  each lady was previously\\nwell disposed for an agreement, and saw nothing, therefore,\\nbut good manners in the other; and with regard to the gentlemen,\\nthere was such an hearty good humour, such an open, trusting liberality\\non the admiral\\'s side, as could not but influence sir walter,\\nwho had besides been flattered into his very best and most polished\\nbehaviour by mr shepherd\\'s assurances of his being known, by report,\\nto the admiral, as a model of good breeding.\\n\\nthe house and grounds, and furniture, were approved, the crofts\\nwere approved, terms, time, every thing, and every body, was right;\\nand mr shepherd\\'s clerks were set to work, without there having been\\na single preliminary difference to modify of all that\\n\"this indenture sheweth.\"\\n\\nsir walter, without hesitation, declared the admiral to be\\nthe best-looking sailor he had ever met with, and went so far as to say,\\nthat if his own man might have had the arranging of his hair,\\nhe should not be ashamed of being seen with him any where;\\nand the admiral, with sympathetic cordiality, observed to his wife\\nas they drove back through the park, \"i thought we should soon\\ncome to a deal, my dear, in spite of what they told us at taunton.\\nthe baronet will never set the thames on fire, but there seems to be\\nno harm in him.\"  reciprocal compliments, which would have been\\nesteemed about equal.\\n\\nthe crofts were to have possession at michaelmas; and as sir walter\\nproposed removing to bath in the course of the preceding month,\\nthere was no time to be lost in making every dependent arrangement.\\n\\nlady russell, convinced that anne would not be allowed to be of any use,\\nor any importance, in the choice of the house which they were\\ngoing to secure, was very unwilling to have her hurried away so soon,\\nand wanted to make it possible for her to stay behind till she might\\nconvey her to bath herself after christmas; but having engagements\\nof her own which must take her from kellynch for several weeks,\\nshe was unable to give the full invitation she wished, and anne\\nthough dreading the possible heats of september in all the white glare\\nof bath, and grieving to forego all the influence so sweet and so sad\\nof the autumnal months in the country, did not think that,\\neverything considered, she wished to remain.  it would be most right,\\nand most wise, and, therefore must involve least suffering\\nto go with the others.\\n\\nsomething occurred, however, to give her a different duty.\\nmary, often a little unwell, and always thinking a great deal\\nof her own complaints, and always in the habit of claiming anne\\nwhen anything was the matter, was indisposed; and foreseeing\\nthat she should not have a day\\'s health all the autumn, entreated,\\nor rather required her, for it was hardly entreaty, to come to\\nuppercross cottage, and bear her company as long as she should want her,\\ninstead of going to bath.\\n\\n\"i cannot possibly do without anne,\" was mary\\'s reasoning;\\nand elizabeth\\'s reply was, \"then i am sure anne had better stay,\\nfor nobody will want her in bath.\"\\n\\nto be claimed as a good, though in an improper style, is at least\\nbetter than being rejected as no good at all; and anne, glad to\\nbe thought of some use, glad to have anything marked out as a duty,\\nand certainly not sorry to have the scene of it in the country,\\nand her own dear country, readily agreed to stay.\\n\\nthis invitation of mary\\'s removed all lady russell\\'s difficulties,\\nand it was consequently soon settled that anne should not go to bath\\ntill lady russell took her, and that all the intervening time\\nshould be divided between uppercross cottage and kellynch lodge.\\n\\nso far all was perfectly right; but lady russell was almost startled\\nby the wrong of one part of the kellynch hall plan, when it burst on her,\\nwhich was, mrs clay\\'s being engaged to go to bath with sir walter\\nand elizabeth, as a most important and valuable assistant to the latter\\nin all the business before her.  lady russell was extremely sorry\\nthat such a measure should have been resorted to at all, wondered,\\ngrieved, and feared; and the affront it contained to anne,\\nin mrs clay\\'s being of so much use, while anne could be of none,\\nwas a very sore aggravation.\\n\\nanne herself was become hardened to such affronts; but she felt\\nthe imprudence of the arrangement quite as keenly as lady russell.\\nwith a great deal of quiet observation, and a knowledge,\\nwhich she often wished less, of her father\\'s character, she was\\nsensible that results the most serious to his family from the intimacy\\nwere more than possible.  she did not imagine that her father\\nhad at present an idea of the kind.  mrs clay had freckles,\\nand a projecting tooth, and a clumsy wrist, which he was continually\\nmaking severe remarks upon, in her absence; but she was young,\\nand certainly altogether well-looking, and possessed, in an acute mind\\nand assiduous pleasing manners, infinitely more dangerous attractions\\nthan any merely personal might have been.  anne was so impressed\\nby the degree of their danger, that she could not excuse herself\\nfrom trying to make it perceptible to her sister.  she had little hope\\nof success; but elizabeth, who in the event of such a reverse would be\\nso much more to be pitied than herself, should never, she thought,\\nhave reason to reproach her for giving no warning.\\n\\nshe spoke, and seemed only to offend.  elizabeth could not conceive\\nhow such an absurd suspicion should occur to her, and indignantly\\nanswered for each party\\'s perfectly knowing their situation.\\n\\n\"mrs clay,\" said she, warmly, \"never forgets who she is;\\nand as i am rather better acquainted with her sentiments than you can be,\\ni can assure you, that upon the subject of marriage they are\\nparticularly nice, and that she reprobates all inequality of condition\\nand rank more strongly than most people.  and as to my father,\\ni really should not have thought that he, who has kept himself single\\nso long for our sakes, need be suspected now.  if mrs clay were\\na very beautiful woman, i grant you, it might be wrong to have her\\nso much with me; not that anything in the world, i am sure,\\nwould induce my father to make a degrading match, but he might\\nbe rendered unhappy.  but poor mrs clay who, with all her merits,\\ncan never have been reckoned tolerably pretty, i really think poor\\nmrs clay may be staying here in perfect safety.  one would imagine\\nyou had never heard my father speak of her personal misfortunes,\\nthough i know you must fifty times.  that tooth of her\\'s\\nand those freckles.  freckles do not disgust me so very much\\nas they do him.  i have known a face not materially disfigured by a few,\\nbut he abominates them.  you must have heard him notice\\nmrs clay\\'s freckles.\"\\n\\n\"there is hardly any personal defect,\" replied anne,\\n\"which an agreeable manner might not gradually reconcile one to.\"\\n\\n\"i think very differently,\" answered elizabeth, shortly;\\n\"an agreeable manner may set off handsome features, but can never\\nalter plain ones.  however, at any rate, as i have a great deal more\\nat stake on this point than anybody else can have, i think it\\nrather unnecessary in you to be advising me.\"\\n\\nanne had done; glad that it was over, and not absolutely hopeless\\nof doing good.  elizabeth, though resenting the suspicion,\\nmight yet be made observant by it.\\n\\nthe last office of the four carriage-horses was to draw sir walter,\\nmiss elliot, and mrs clay to bath.  the party drove off in very good spirits;\\nsir walter prepared with condescending bows for all the afflicted\\ntenantry and cottagers who might have had a hint to show themselves,\\nand anne walked up at the same time, in a sort of desolate tranquillity,\\nto the lodge, where she was to spend the first week.\\n\\nher friend was not in better spirits than herself. lady russell felt this\\nbreak-up of the family exceedingly.  their respectability was\\nas dear to her as her own, and a daily intercourse had become\\nprecious by habit.  it was painful to look upon their deserted grounds,\\nand still worse to anticipate the new hands they were to fall into;\\nand to escape the solitariness and the melancholy of so altered a village,\\nand be out of the way when admiral and mrs croft first arrived,\\nshe had determined to make her own absence from home begin\\nwhen she must give up anne.  accordingly their removal was made together,\\nand anne was set down at uppercross cottage, in the first stage\\nof lady russell\\'s journey.\\n\\nuppercross was a moderate-sized village, which a few years back\\nhad been completely in the old english style, containing only\\ntwo houses superior in appearance to those of the yeomen and labourers;\\nthe mansion of the squire, with its high walls, great gates, and old trees,\\nsubstantial and unmodernized, and the compact, tight parsonage,\\nenclosed in its own neat garden, with a vine and a pear-tree\\ntrained round its casements; but upon the marriage of the young \\'squire,\\nit had received the improvement of a farm-house elevated into a cottage,\\nfor his residence, and uppercross cottage, with its veranda,\\nfrench windows, and other prettiness, was quite as likely to catch\\nthe traveller\\'s eye as the more consistent and considerable aspect\\nand premises of the great house, about a quarter of a mile farther on.\\n\\nhere anne had often been staying.  she knew the ways of uppercross\\nas well as those of kellynch.  the two families were so continually meeting,\\nso much in the habit of running in and out of each other\\'s house\\nat all hours, that it was rather a surprise to her to find mary alone;\\nbut being alone, her being unwell and out of spirits was almost\\na matter of course.  though better endowed than the elder sister,\\nmary had not anne\\'s understanding nor temper.  while well, and happy,\\nand properly attended to, she had great good humour and excellent spirits;\\nbut any indisposition sunk her completely.  she had no resources\\nfor solitude; and inheriting a considerable share of the elliot\\nself-importance, was very prone to add to every other distress\\nthat of fancying herself neglected and ill-used.  in person, she was\\ninferior to both sisters, and had, even in her bloom, only reached\\nthe dignity of being \"a fine girl.\"  she was now lying on the faded sofa\\nof the pretty little drawing-room, the once elegant furniture of which\\nhad been gradually growing shabby, under the influence of four summers\\nand two children; and, on anne\\'s appearing, greeted her with--\\n\\n\"so, you are come at last!  i began to think i should never see you.\\ni am so ill i can hardly speak.  i have not seen a creature\\nthe whole morning!\"\\n\\n\"i am sorry to find you unwell,\" replied anne.  \"you sent me\\nsuch a good account of yourself on thursday!\"\\n\\n\"yes, i made the best of it; i always do:  but i was very far from well\\nat the time; and i do not think i ever was so ill in my life\\nas i have been all this morning:  very unfit to be left alone, i am sure.\\nsuppose i were to be seized of a sudden in some dreadful way,\\nand not able to ring the bell!  so, lady russell would not get out.\\ni do not think she has been in this house three times this summer.\"\\n\\nanne said what was proper, and enquired after her husband.\\n\"oh! charles is out shooting.  i have not seen him since seven o\\'clock.\\nhe would go, though i told him how ill i was.  he said he should not\\nstay out long; but he has never come back, and now it is almost one.\\ni assure you, i have not seen a soul this whole long morning.\"\\n\\n\"you have had your little boys with you?\"\\n\\n\"yes, as long as i could bear their noise; but they are so unmanageable\\nthat they do me more harm than good.  little charles does not mind\\na word i say, and walter is growing quite as bad.\"\\n\\n\"well, you will soon be better now,\" replied anne, cheerfully.\\n\"you know i always cure you when i come.  how are your neighbours\\nat the great house?\"\\n\\n\"i can give you no account of them.  i have not seen one of them to-day,\\nexcept mr musgrove, who just stopped and spoke through the window,\\nbut without getting off his horse; and though i told him how ill i was,\\nnot one of them have been near me.  it did not happen to suit\\nthe miss musgroves, i suppose, and they never put themselves\\nout of their way.\"\\n\\n\"you will see them yet, perhaps, before the morning is gone.\\nit is early.\"\\n\\n\"i never want them, i assure you.  they talk and laugh a great deal\\ntoo much for me.  oh! anne, i am so very unwell!  it was quite unkind\\nof you not to come on thursday.\"\\n\\n\"my dear mary, recollect what a comfortable account you sent me of yourself!\\nyou wrote in the cheerfullest manner, and said you were perfectly well,\\nand in no hurry for me; and that being the case, you must be aware\\nthat my wish would be to remain with lady russell to the last:\\nand besides what i felt on her account, i have really been so busy,\\nhave had so much to do, that i could not very conveniently have\\nleft kellynch sooner.\"\\n\\n\"dear me! what can you possibly have to do?\"\\n\\n\"a great many things, i assure you.  more than i can recollect\\nin a moment; but i can tell you some.  i have been making\\na duplicate of the catalogue of my father\\'s books and pictures.\\ni have been several times in the garden with mackenzie,\\ntrying to understand, and make him understand, which of elizabeth\\'s plants\\nare for lady russell.  i have had all my own little concerns\\nto arrange, books and music to divide, and all my trunks to repack,\\nfrom not having understood in time what was intended as to the waggons:\\nand one thing i have had to do, mary, of a more trying nature:\\ngoing to almost every house in the parish, as a sort of take-leave.\\ni was told that they wished it.  but all these things took up\\na great deal of time.\"\\n\\n\"oh! well!\" and after a moment\\'s pause, \"but you have never asked me\\none word about our dinner at the pooles yesterday.\"\\n\\n\"did you go then?  i have made no enquiries, because i concluded\\nyou must have been obliged to give up the party.\"\\n\\n\"oh yes! i went.  i was very well yesterday; nothing at all\\nthe matter with me till this morning.  it would have been strange\\nif i had not gone.\"\\n\\n\"i am very glad you were well enough, and i hope you had a pleasant party.\"\\n\\n\"nothing remarkable.  one always knows beforehand what the dinner will be,\\nand who will be there; and it is so very uncomfortable not having\\na carriage of one\\'s own.  mr and mrs musgrove took me, and we were\\nso crowded!  they are both so very large, and take up so much room;\\nand mr musgrove always sits forward.  so, there was i, crowded into\\nthe back seat with henrietta and louise; and i think it very likely\\nthat my illness to-day may be owing to it.\"\\n\\na little further perseverance in patience and forced cheerfulness\\non anne\\'s side produced nearly a cure on mary\\'s.  she could soon\\nsit upright on the sofa, and began to hope she might be able\\nto leave it by dinner-time.  then, forgetting to think of it,\\nshe was at the other end of the room, beautifying a nosegay;\\nthen, she ate her cold meat; and then she was well enough\\nto propose a little walk.\\n\\n\"where shall we go?\" said she, when they were ready.  \"i suppose\\nyou will not like to call at the great house before they have\\nbeen to see you?\"\\n\\n\"i have not the smallest objection on that account,\" replied anne.\\n\"i should never think of standing on such ceremony with people i know\\nso well as mrs and the miss musgroves.\"\\n\\n\"oh! but they ought to call upon you as soon as possible.\\nthey ought to feel what is due to you as my sister.  however,\\nwe may as well go and sit with them a little  while, and when we\\nhave that over, we can enjoy our walk.\"\\n\\nanne had always thought such a style of intercourse highly imprudent;\\nbut she had ceased to endeavour to check it, from believing that,\\nthough there were on each side continual subjects of offence,\\nneither family could now do without it.  to the great house accordingly\\nthey went, to sit the full half hour in the old-fashioned square parlour,\\nwith a small carpet and shining floor, to which the present\\ndaughters of the house were gradually giving the proper air of confusion\\nby a grand piano-forte and a harp, flower-stands and little tables\\nplaced in every direction.  oh! could the originals of the portraits\\nagainst the wainscot, could the gentlemen in brown velvet and\\nthe ladies in blue satin have seen what was going on, have been conscious\\nof such an overthrow of all order and neatness!  the portraits themselves\\nseemed to be staring in astonishment.\\n\\nthe musgroves, like their houses, were in a state of alteration,\\nperhaps of improvement.  the father and mother were in the old\\nenglish style, and the young people in the new.  mr and mrs musgrove\\nwere a very good sort of people; friendly and hospitable,\\nnot much educated, and not at all elegant.  their children had\\nmore modern minds and manners.  there was a numerous family;\\nbut the only two grown up, excepting charles, were henrietta and louisa,\\nyoung ladies of nineteen and twenty, who had brought from school at exeter\\nall the usual stock of accomplishments, and were now like thousands\\nof other young ladies, living to be fashionable, happy, and merry.\\ntheir dress had every advantage, their faces were rather pretty,\\ntheir spirits extremely good, their manner unembarrassed and pleasant;\\nthey were of consequence at home, and favourites abroad.\\nanne always contemplated them as some of the happiest creatures\\nof her acquaintance; but still, saved as we all are, by some\\ncomfortable feeling of superiority from wishing for the possibility\\nof exchange, she would not have given up her own more elegant\\nand cultivated mind for all their enjoyments; and envied them nothing\\nbut that seemingly perfect good understanding and agreement together,\\nthat good-humoured mutual affection, of which she had known\\nso little herself with either of her sisters.\\n\\nthey were received with great cordiality.  nothing seemed amiss\\non the side of the great house family, which was generally,\\nas anne very well knew, the least to blame.  the half hour was\\nchatted away pleasantly enough; and she was not at all surprised\\nat the end of it, to have their walking party joined by both\\nthe miss musgroves, at mary\\'s particular invitation.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 6\\n\\n\\nanne had not wanted this visit to uppercross, to learn that a removal\\nfrom one set of people to another, though at a distance of only three miles,\\nwill often include a total change of conversation, opinion, and idea.\\nshe had never been staying there before, without being struck by it,\\nor without wishing that other elliots could have her advantage\\nin seeing how unknown, or unconsidered there, were the affairs\\nwhich at kellynch hall were treated as of such general publicity\\nand pervading interest; yet, with all this experience, she believed\\nshe must now submit to feel that another lesson, in the art of knowing\\nour own nothingness beyond our own circle, was become necessary for her;\\nfor certainly, coming as she did, with a heart full of the subject\\nwhich had been completely occupying both houses in kellynch for many weeks,\\nshe had expected rather more curiosity and sympathy than she found\\nin the separate but very similar remark of mr and mrs musgrove:\\n\"so, miss anne, sir walter and your sister are gone; and what part of bath\\ndo you think they will settle in?\" and this, without much\\nwaiting for an answer; or in the young ladies\\' addition of,\\n\"i hope we shall be in bath in the winter; but remember, papa,\\nif we do go, we must be in a good situation:  none of your\\nqueen squares for us!\" or in the anxious supplement from mary, of--\\n\"upon my word, i shall be pretty well off, when you are all gone away\\nto be happy at bath!\"\\n\\nshe could only resolve to avoid such self-delusion in future,\\nand think with heightened gratitude of the extraordinary blessing\\nof having one such truly sympathising friend as lady russell.\\n\\nthe mr musgroves had their own game to guard, and to destroy,\\ntheir own horses, dogs, and newspapers to engage them, and the females\\nwere fully occupied in all the other common subjects of housekeeping,\\nneighbours, dress, dancing, and music.  she acknowledged it to be\\nvery fitting, that every little social commonwealth should dictate\\nits own matters of discourse; and hoped, ere long, to become\\na not unworthy member of the one she was now transplanted into.\\nwith the prospect of spending at least two months at uppercross,\\nit was highly incumbent on her to clothe her imagination, her memory,\\nand all her ideas in as much of uppercross as possible.\\n\\nshe had no dread of these two months.  mary was not so repulsive\\nand unsisterly as elizabeth, nor so inaccessible to all influence of hers;\\nneither was there anything among the other component parts\\nof the cottage inimical to comfort.  she was always on friendly terms\\nwith her brother-in-law; and in the children, who loved her nearly as well,\\nand respected her a great deal more than their mother, she had\\nan object of interest, amusement, and wholesome exertion.\\n\\ncharles musgrove was civil and agreeable; in sense and temper he was\\nundoubtedly superior to his wife, but not of powers, or conversation,\\nor grace, to make the past, as they were connected together,\\nat all a dangerous contemplation; though, at the same time,\\nanne could believe, with lady russell, that a more equal match\\nmight have greatly improved him; and that a woman of real understanding\\nmight have given more consequence to his character, and more usefulness,\\nrationality, and elegance to his habits and pursuits.  as it was,\\nhe did nothing with much zeal, but sport; and his time was otherwise\\ntrifled away, without benefit from books or anything else.\\nhe had very good spirits, which never seemed much affected by\\nhis wife\\'s occasional lowness, bore with her unreasonableness\\nsometimes to anne\\'s admiration, and upon the whole, though there was\\nvery often a little disagreement (in which she had sometimes more share\\nthan she wished, being appealed to by both parties), they might pass\\nfor a happy couple.  they were always perfectly agreed in the want\\nof more money, and a strong inclination for a handsome present\\nfrom his father; but here, as on most topics, he had the superiority,\\nfor while mary thought it a great shame that such a present was not made,\\nhe always contended for his father\\'s having many other uses for his money,\\nand a right to spend it as he liked.\\n\\nas to the management of their children, his theory was much better\\nthan his wife\\'s, and his practice not so bad.  \"i could manage them\\nvery well, if it were not for mary\\'s interference,\" was what\\nanne often heard him say, and had a good deal of faith in;\\nbut when listening in turn to mary\\'s reproach of \"charles spoils\\nthe children so that i cannot get them into any order,\" she never had\\nthe smallest temptation to say, \"very true.\"\\n\\none of the least agreeable circumstances of her residence there\\nwas her being treated with too much confidence by all parties,\\nand being too much in the secret of the complaints of each house.\\nknown to have some influence with her sister, she was continually requested,\\nor at least receiving hints to exert it, beyond what was practicable.\\n\"i wish you could persuade mary not to be always fancying herself ill,\"\\nwas charles\\'s language; and, in an unhappy mood, thus spoke mary:\\n\"i do believe if charles were to see me dying, he would not think\\nthere was anything the matter with me.  i am sure, anne, if you would,\\nyou might persuade him that i really am very ill--a great deal worse\\nthan i ever own.\"\\n\\nmary\\'s declaration was, \"i hate sending the children to the great house,\\nthough their grandmamma is always wanting to see them, for she humours\\nand indulges them to such a degree, and gives them so much trash\\nand sweet things, that they are sure to come back sick and cross\\nfor the rest of the day.\"  and mrs musgrove took the first opportunity\\nof being alone with anne, to say, \"oh! miss anne, i cannot help wishing\\nmrs charles had a little of your method with those children.\\nthey are quite different creatures with you!  but to be sure,\\nin general they are so spoilt!  it is a pity you cannot put your sister\\nin the way of managing them.  they are as fine healthy children\\nas ever were seen, poor little dears! without partiality;\\nbut mrs charles knows no more how they should be treated--!\\nbless me! how troublesome they are sometimes.  i assure you, miss anne,\\nit prevents my wishing to see them at our house so often as\\ni otherwise should.  i believe mrs charles is not quite pleased\\nwith my not inviting them oftener; but you know it is very bad\\nto have children with one that one is obligated to be checking\\nevery moment; \"don\\'t do this,\" and \"don\\'t do that;\"  or that one can\\nonly keep in tolerable order by more cake than is good for them.\"\\n\\nshe had this communication, moreover, from mary.  \"mrs musgrove thinks\\nall her servants so steady, that it would be high treason\\nto call it in question; but i am sure, without exaggeration,\\nthat her upper house-maid and laundry-maid, instead of being\\nin their business, are gadding about the village, all day long.\\ni meet them wherever i go; and i declare, i never go twice into my nursery\\nwithout seeing something of them.  if jemima were not the trustiest,\\nsteadiest creature in the world, it would be enough to spoil her;\\nfor she tells me, they are always tempting her to take a walk with them.\"\\nand on mrs musgrove\\'s side, it was, \"i make a rule of never interfering\\nin any of my daughter-in-law\\'s concerns, for i know it would not do;\\nbut i shall tell you, miss anne, because you may be able to set things\\nto rights, that i have no very good opinion of mrs charles\\'s nursery-maid:\\ni hear strange stories of her; she is always upon the gad; and from\\nmy own knowledge, i can declare, she is such a fine-dressing lady,\\nthat she is enough to ruin any servants she comes near.\\nmrs charles quite swears by her, i know; but i just give you this hint,\\nthat you may be upon the watch; because, if you see anything amiss,\\nyou need not be afraid of mentioning it.\"\\n\\nagain, it was mary\\'s complaint, that mrs musgrove was very apt\\nnot to give her the precedence that was her due, when they dined\\nat the great house with other families; and she did not see any reason\\nwhy she was to be considered so much at home as to lose her place.\\nand one day when anne was walking with only the musgroves, one of them\\nafter talking of rank, people of rank, and jealousy of rank, said,\\n\"i have no scruple of observing to you, how nonsensical some persons are\\nabout their place, because all the world knows how easy and indifferent\\nyou are about it; but i wish anybody could give mary a hint that\\nit would be a great deal better if she were not so very tenacious,\\nespecially if she would not be always putting herself forward to take\\nplace of mamma.  nobody doubts her right to have precedence of mamma,\\nbut it would be more becoming in her not to be always insisting on it.\\nit is not that mamma cares about it the least in the world,\\nbut i know it is taken notice of by many persons.\"\\n\\nhow was anne to set all these matters to rights?  she could do little more\\nthan listen patiently, soften every grievance, and excuse each\\nto the other; give them all hints of the forbearance necessary\\nbetween such near neighbours, and make those hints broadest\\nwhich were meant for her sister\\'s benefit.\\n\\nin all other respects, her visit began and proceeded very well.\\nher own spirits improved by change of place and subject,\\nby being removed three miles from kellynch; mary\\'s ailments lessened\\nby having a constant companion, and their daily intercourse\\nwith the other family, since there was neither superior affection,\\nconfidence, nor employment in the cottage, to be interrupted by it,\\nwas rather an advantage.  it was certainly carried nearly as far as possible,\\nfor they met every morning, and hardly ever spent an evening asunder;\\nbut she believed they should not have done so well without the sight\\nof mr and mrs musgrove\\'s respectable forms in the usual places,\\nor without the talking, laughing, and singing of their daughters.\\n\\nshe played a great deal better than either of the miss musgroves,\\nbut having no voice, no knowledge of the harp, and no fond parents,\\nto sit by and fancy themselves delighted, her performance was\\nlittle thought of, only out of civility, or to refresh the others,\\nas she was well aware.  she knew that when she played she was\\ngiving pleasure only to herself; but this was no new sensation.\\nexcepting one short period of her life, she had never, since the age\\nof fourteen, never since the loss of her dear mother, known the happiness\\nof being listened to, or encouraged by any just appreciation or real taste.\\nin music she had been always used to feel alone in the world;\\nand mr and mrs musgrove\\'s fond partiality for their own daughters\\'\\nperformance, and total indifference to any other person\\'s,\\ngave her much more pleasure for their sakes, than mortification\\nfor her own.\\n\\nthe party at the great house was sometimes increased by other company.\\nthe neighbourhood was not large, but the musgroves were visited\\nby everybody, and had more dinner-parties, and more callers,\\nmore visitors by invitation and by chance, than any other family.\\nthere were more completely popular.\\n\\nthe girls were wild for dancing; and the evenings ended, occasionally,\\nin an unpremeditated little ball.  there was a family of cousins\\nwithin a walk of uppercross, in less affluent circumstances,\\nwho depended on the musgroves for all their pleasures:  they would come\\nat any time, and help play at anything, or dance anywhere; and anne,\\nvery much preferring the office of musician to a more active post,\\nplayed country dances to them by the hour together; a kindness which\\nalways recommended her musical powers to the notice of mr and mrs musgrove\\nmore than anything else, and often drew this compliment;--\\n\"well done, miss anne! very well done indeed!  lord bless me!\\nhow those little fingers of yours fly about!\"\\n\\nso passed the first three weeks.  michaelmas came; and now anne\\'s heart\\nmust be in kellynch again.  a beloved home made over to others;\\nall the precious rooms and furniture, groves, and prospects,\\nbeginning to own other eyes and other limbs!  she could not\\nthink of much else on the 29th of september; and she had this\\nsympathetic touch in the evening from mary, who, on having occasion\\nto note down the day of the month, exclaimed, \"dear me, is not this\\nthe day the crofts were to come to kellynch?  i am glad i did not\\nthink of it before.  how low it makes me!\"\\n\\nthe crofts took possession with true naval alertness, and were\\nto be visited.  mary deplored the necessity for herself.\\n\"nobody knew how much she should suffer.  she should put it off\\nas long as she could;\" but was not easy till she had talked charles\\ninto driving her over on an early day, and was in a very animated,\\ncomfortable state of imaginary agitation, when she came back.\\nanne had very sincerely rejoiced in there being no means of her going.\\nshe wished, however to see the crofts, and was glad to be within\\nwhen the visit was returned.  they came:  the master of the house\\nwas not at home, but the two sisters were together; and as it chanced\\nthat mrs croft fell to the share of anne, while the admiral sat by mary,\\nand made himself very agreeable by his good-humoured notice\\nof her little boys, she was well able to watch for a likeness,\\nand if it failed her in the features, to catch it in the voice,\\nor in the turn of sentiment and expression.\\n\\nmrs croft, though neither tall nor fat, had a squareness,\\nuprightness, and vigour of form, which gave importance to her person.\\nshe had bright dark eyes, good teeth, and altogether an agreeable face;\\nthough her reddened and weather-beaten complexion, the consequence\\nof her having been almost as much at sea as her husband, made her seem to\\nhave lived some years longer in the world than her real eight-and-thirty.\\nher manners were open, easy, and decided, like one who had\\nno distrust of herself, and no doubts of what to do; without any\\napproach to coarseness, however, or any want of good humour.\\nanne gave her credit, indeed, for feelings of great consideration\\ntowards herself, in all that related to kellynch, and it pleased her:\\nespecially, as she had satisfied herself in the very first half minute,\\nin the instant even of introduction, that there was not the smallest\\nsymptom of any knowledge or suspicion on mrs croft\\'s side, to give a bias\\nof any sort.  she was quite easy on that head, and consequently\\nfull of strength and courage, till for a moment electrified by\\nmrs croft\\'s suddenly saying,--\\n\\n\"it was you, and not your sister, i find, that my brother had\\nthe pleasure of being acquainted with, when he was in this country.\"\\n\\nanne hoped she had outlived the age of blushing; but the age of emotion\\nshe certainly had not.\\n\\n\"perhaps you may not have heard that he is married?\" added mrs croft.\\n\\nshe could now answer as she ought; and was happy to feel,\\nwhen mrs croft\\'s next words explained it to be mr wentworth\\nof whom she spoke, that she had said nothing which might not do\\nfor either brother. she immediately felt how reasonable it was,\\nthat mrs croft should be thinking and speaking of edward,\\nand not of frederick; and with shame at her own forgetfulness\\napplied herself to the knowledge of their former neighbour\\'s\\npresent state with proper interest.\\n\\nthe rest was all tranquillity; till, just as they were moving,\\nshe heard the admiral say to mary--\\n\\n\"we are expecting a brother of mrs croft\\'s here soon; i dare say\\nyou know him by name.\"\\n\\nhe was cut short by the eager attacks of the little boys,\\nclinging to him like an old friend, and declaring he should not go;\\nand being too much engrossed by proposals of carrying them away\\nin his coat pockets, &c., to have another moment for finishing\\nor recollecting what he had begun, anne was left to persuade herself,\\nas well as she could, that the same brother must still be in question.\\nshe could not, however, reach such a degree of certainty,\\nas not to be anxious to hear whether anything had been said on the subject\\nat the other house, where the crofts had previously been calling.\\n\\nthe folks of the great house were to spend the evening of this day\\nat the cottage; and it being now too late in the year for such visits\\nto be made on foot, the coach was beginning to be listened for,\\nwhen the youngest miss musgrove walked in.  that she was coming\\nto apologize, and that they should have to spend the evening by themselves,\\nwas the first black idea; and mary was quite ready to be affronted,\\nwhen louisa made all right by saying, that she only came on foot,\\nto leave more room for the harp, which was bringing in the carriage.\\n\\n\"and i will tell you our reason,\" she added, \"and all about it.\\ni am come on to give you notice, that papa and mamma are\\nout of spirits this evening, especially mamma; she is thinking so much\\nof poor richard!  and we agreed it would be best to have the harp,\\nfor it seems to amuse her more than the piano-forte.  i will tell you\\nwhy she is out of spirits.  when the crofts called this morning,\\n(they called here afterwards, did not they?), they happened to say,\\nthat her brother, captain wentworth, is just returned to england,\\nor paid off, or something, and is coming to see them almost directly;\\nand most unluckily it came into mamma\\'s head, when they were gone,\\nthat wentworth, or something very like it, was the name of\\npoor richard\\'s captain at one time; i do not know when or where,\\nbut a great while before he died, poor fellow!  and upon looking over\\nhis letters and things, she found it was so, and is perfectly sure\\nthat this must be the very man, and her head is quite full of it,\\nand of poor richard!  so we must be as merry as we can, that she may not\\nbe dwelling upon such gloomy things.\"\\n\\nthe real circumstances of this pathetic piece of family history were,\\nthat the musgroves had had the ill fortune of a very troublesome,\\nhopeless son; and the good fortune to lose him before he reached\\nhis twentieth year; that he had been sent to sea because he was stupid\\nand unmanageable on shore; that he had been very little cared for\\nat any time by his family, though quite as much as he deserved;\\nseldom heard of, and scarcely at all regretted, when the intelligence\\nof his death abroad had worked its way to uppercross, two years before.\\n\\nhe had, in fact, though his sisters were now doing all they could for him,\\nby calling him \"poor richard,\" been nothing better than a thick-headed,\\nunfeeling, unprofitable dick musgrove, who had never done anything\\nto entitle himself to more than the abbreviation of his name,\\nliving or dead.\\n\\nhe had been several years at sea, and had, in the course of those removals\\nto which all midshipmen are liable, and especially such midshipmen\\nas every captain wishes to get rid of, been six months on board\\ncaptain frederick wentworth\\'s frigate, the laconia; and from the laconia\\nhe had, under the influence of his captain, written the only two letters\\nwhich his father and mother had ever received from him during the whole\\nof his absence; that is to say, the only two disinterested letters;\\nall the rest had been mere applications for money.\\n\\nin each letter he had spoken well of his captain; but yet,\\nso little were they in the habit of attending to such matters,\\nso unobservant and incurious were they as to the names of men or ships,\\nthat it had made scarcely any impression at the time; and that mrs musgrove\\nshould have been suddenly struck, this very day, with a recollection\\nof the name of wentworth, as connected with her son, seemed one of those\\nextraordinary bursts of mind which do sometimes occur.\\n\\nshe had gone to her letters, and found it all as she supposed;\\nand the re-perusal of these letters, after so long an interval,\\nher poor son gone for ever, and all the strength of his faults forgotten,\\nhad affected her spirits exceedingly, and thrown her into\\ngreater grief for him than she had know on first hearing of his death.\\nmr musgrove was, in a lesser degree, affected likewise; and when\\nthey reached the cottage, they were evidently in want, first,\\nof being listened to anew on this subject, and afterwards,\\nof all the relief which cheerful companions could give them.\\n\\nto hear them talking so much of captain wentworth, repeating his name\\nso often, puzzling over past years, and at last ascertaining that it might,\\nthat it probably would, turn out to be the very same captain wentworth\\nwhom they recollected meeting, once or twice, after their coming back\\nfrom clifton--a very fine young man--but they could not say whether\\nit was seven or eight years ago, was a new sort of trial to anne\\'s nerves.\\nshe found, however, that it was one to which she must inure herself.\\nsince he actually was expected in the country, she must teach herself\\nto be insensible on such points.  and not only did it appear that\\nhe was expected, and speedily, but the musgroves, in their warm gratitude\\nfor the kindness he had shewn poor dick, and very high respect\\nfor his character, stamped as it was by poor dick\\'s having been\\nsix months under his care, and mentioning him in strong,\\nthough not perfectly well-spelt praise, as \"a fine dashing felow,\\nonly two perticular about the schoolmaster,\" were bent on\\nintroducing themselves, and seeking his acquaintance, as soon as\\nthey could hear of his arrival.\\n\\nthe resolution of doing so helped to form the comfort of their evening.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 7\\n\\n\\na very few days more, and captain wentworth was known to be at kellynch,\\nand mr musgrove had called on him, and come back warm in his praise,\\nand he was engaged with the crofts to dine at uppercross,\\nby the end of another week.  it had been a great disappointment\\nto mr musgrove to find that no earlier day could be fixed,\\nso impatient was he to shew his gratitude, by seeing captain wentworth\\nunder his own roof, and welcoming him to all that was strongest\\nand best in his cellars.  but a week must pass; only a week,\\nin anne\\'s reckoning, and then, she supposed, they must meet;\\nand soon she began to wish that she could feel secure even for a week.\\n\\ncaptain wentworth made a very early return to mr musgrove\\'s civility,\\nand she was all but calling there in the same half hour.\\nshe and mary were actually setting forward for the great house,\\nwhere, as she afterwards learnt, they must inevitably have found him,\\nwhen they were stopped by the eldest boy\\'s being at that moment\\nbrought home in consequence of a bad fall.  the child\\'s situation\\nput the visit entirely aside; but she could not hear of her escape\\nwith indifference, even in the midst of the serious anxiety\\nwhich they afterwards felt on his account.\\n\\nhis collar-bone was found to be dislocated, and such injury\\nreceived in the back, as roused the most alarming ideas.\\nit was an afternoon of distress, and anne had every thing to do at once;\\nthe apothecary to send for, the father to have pursued and informed,\\nthe mother to support and keep from hysterics, the servants to control,\\nthe youngest child to banish, and the poor suffering one to attend\\nand soothe; besides sending, as soon as she recollected it,\\nproper notice to the other house, which brought her an accession\\nrather of frightened, enquiring companions, than of very useful assistants.\\n\\nher brother\\'s return was the first comfort; he could take best care\\nof his wife; and the second blessing was the arrival of the apothecary.\\ntill he came and had examined the child, their apprehensions were\\nthe worse for being vague; they suspected great injury, but knew not where;\\nbut now the collar-bone was soon replaced, and though mr robinson\\nfelt and felt, and rubbed, and looked grave, and spoke low words\\nboth to the father and the aunt, still they were all to hope the best,\\nand to be able to part and eat their dinner in tolerable ease of mind;\\nand then it was, just before they parted, that the two young aunts\\nwere able so far to digress from their nephew\\'s state, as to give\\nthe information of captain wentworth\\'s visit; staying five minutes behind\\ntheir father and mother, to endeavour to express how perfectly delighted\\nthey were with him, how much handsomer, how infinitely more agreeable\\nthey thought him than any individual among their male acquaintance,\\nwho had been at all a favourite before.  how glad they had been\\nto hear papa invite him to stay dinner, how sorry when he said\\nit was quite out of his power, and how glad again when he had promised\\nin reply to papa and mamma\\'s farther pressing invitations to come\\nand dine with them on the morrow--actually on the morrow;\\nand he had promised it in so pleasant a manner, as if he felt\\nall the motive of their attention just as he ought.  and in short,\\nhe had looked and said everything with such exquisite grace,\\nthat they could assure them all, their heads were both turned by him;\\nand off they ran, quite as full of glee as of love, and apparently\\nmore full of captain wentworth than of little charles.\\n\\nthe same story and the same raptures were repeated, when the two girls came\\nwith their father, through the gloom of the evening, to make enquiries;\\nand mr musgrove, no longer under the first uneasiness about his heir,\\ncould add his confirmation and praise, and hope there would be now\\nno occasion for putting captain wentworth off, and only be sorry to think\\nthat the cottage party, probably, would not like to leave the little boy,\\nto give him the meeting.  \"oh no; as to leaving the little boy,\"\\nboth father and mother were in much too strong and recent alarm\\nto bear the thought; and anne, in the joy of the escape,\\ncould not help adding her warm protestations to theirs.\\n\\ncharles musgrove, indeed, afterwards, shewed more of inclination;\\n\"the child was going on so well, and he wished so much to be introduced\\nto captain wentworth, that, perhaps, he might join them in the evening;\\nhe would not dine from home, but he might walk in for half an hour.\"\\nbut in this he was eagerly opposed by his wife, with \"oh! no, indeed,\\ncharles, i cannot bear to have you go away.  only think if anything\\nshould happen?\"\\n\\nthe child had a good night, and was going on well the next day.\\nit must be a work of time to ascertain that no injury had been\\ndone to the spine; but mr robinson found nothing to increase alarm,\\nand charles musgrove began, consequently, to feel no necessity\\nfor longer confinement.  the child was to be kept in bed and amused\\nas quietly as possible; but what was there for a father to do?\\nthis was quite a female case, and it would be highly absurd in him,\\nwho could be of no use at home, to shut himself up.  his father\\nvery much wished him to meet captain wentworth, and there being\\nno sufficient reason against it, he ought to go; and it ended in his\\nmaking a bold, public declaration, when he came in from shooting,\\nof his meaning to dress directly, and dine at the other house.\\n\\n\"nothing can be going on better than the child,\" said he;\\n\"so i told my father, just now, that i would come, and he thought me\\nquite right.  your sister being with you, my love, i have no scruple at all.\\nyou would not like to leave him yourself, but you see i can be of no use.\\nanne will send for me if anything is the matter.\"\\n\\nhusbands and wives generally understand when opposition will be vain.\\nmary knew, from charles\\'s manner of speaking, that he was\\nquite determined on going, and that it would be of no use to teaze him.\\nshe said nothing, therefore, till he was out of the room,\\nbut as soon as there was only anne to hear--\\n\\n\"so you and i are to be left to shift by ourselves, with this\\npoor sick child; and not a creature coming near us all the evening!\\ni knew how it would be.  this is always my luck.  if there is\\nanything disagreeable going on men are always sure to get out of it,\\nand charles is as bad as any of them.  very unfeeling!  i must say\\nit is very unfeeling of him to be running away from his poor little boy.\\ntalks of his being going on so well!  how does he know that he is\\ngoing on well, or that there may not be a sudden change half an hour hence?\\ni did not think charles would have been so unfeeling.  so here he is to\\ngo away and enjoy himself, and because i am the poor mother,\\ni am not to be allowed to stir; and yet, i am sure, i am more unfit\\nthan anybody else to be about the child.  my being the mother\\nis the very reason why my feelings should not be tried.  i am not at all\\nequal to it.  you saw how hysterical i was yesterday.\"\\n\\n\"but that was only the effect of the suddenness of your alarm--\\nof the shock.  you will not be hysterical again.  i dare say we shall have\\nnothing to distress us.  i perfectly understand mr robinson\\'s directions,\\nand have no fears; and indeed, mary, i cannot wonder at your husband.\\nnursing does not belong to a man; it is not his province.\\na sick child is always the mother\\'s property:  her own feelings\\ngenerally make it so.\"\\n\\n\"i hope i am as fond of my child as any mother, but i do not know\\nthat i am of any more use in the sick-room than charles,\\nfor i cannot be always scolding and teazing the poor child when it is ill;\\nand you saw, this morning, that if i told him to keep quiet,\\nhe was sure to begin kicking about.  i have not nerves\\nfor the sort of thing.\"\\n\\n\"but, could you be comfortable yourself, to be spending\\nthe whole evening away from the poor boy?\"\\n\\n\"yes; you see his papa can, and why should not i?  jemima is so careful;\\nand she could send us word every hour how he was.  i really think\\ncharles might as well have told his father we would all come.\\ni am not more alarmed about little charles now than he is.\\ni was dreadfully alarmed yesterday, but the case is very different to-day.\"\\n\\n\"well, if you do not think it too late to give notice for yourself,\\nsuppose you were to go, as well as your husband.  leave little charles\\nto my care.  mr and mrs musgrove cannot think it wrong while i remain\\nwith him.\"\\n\\n\"are you serious?\" cried mary, her eyes brightening.  \"dear me!\\nthat\\'s a very good thought, very good, indeed.  to be sure,\\ni may just as well go as not, for i am of no use at home--am i?\\nand it only harasses me.  you, who have not a mother\\'s feelings,\\nare a great deal the properest person.  you can make little charles\\ndo anything; he always minds you at a word.  it will be a great deal better\\nthan leaving him only with jemima.  oh! i shall certainly go;\\ni am sure i ought if i can, quite as much as charles, for they want me\\nexcessively to be acquainted with captain wentworth, and i know\\nyou do not mind being left alone.  an excellent thought of yours,\\nindeed, anne.  i will go and tell charles, and get ready directly.\\nyou can send for us, you know, at a moment\\'s notice, if anything\\nis the matter; but i dare say there will be nothing to alarm you.\\ni should not go, you may be sure, if i did not feel quite at ease\\nabout my dear child.\"\\n\\nthe next moment she was tapping at her husband\\'s dressing-room door,\\nand as anne followed her up stairs, she was in time for\\nthe whole conversation, which began with mary\\'s saying,\\nin a tone of great exultation--\\n\\n\"i mean to go with you, charles, for i am of no more use at home\\nthan you are.  if i were to shut myself up for ever with the child,\\ni should not be able to persuade him to do anything he did not like.\\nanne will stay; anne undertakes to stay at home and take care of him.\\nit is anne\\'s own proposal, and so i shall go with you, which will be\\na great deal better, for i have not dined at the other house since tuesday.\"\\n\\n\"this is very kind of anne,\" was her husband\\'s answer, \"and i should be\\nvery glad to have you go; but it seems rather hard that she should be\\nleft at home by herself, to nurse our sick child.\"\\n\\nanne was now at hand to take up her own cause, and the sincerity\\nof her manner being soon sufficient to convince him, where conviction\\nwas at least very agreeable, he had no farther scruples as to her being\\nleft to dine alone, though he still wanted her to join them in the evening,\\nwhen the child might be at rest for the night, and kindly urged her\\nto let him come and fetch her, but she was quite unpersuadable;\\nand this being the case, she had ere long the pleasure of seeing them\\nset off together in high spirits.  they were gone, she hoped,\\nto be happy, however oddly constructed such happiness might seem;\\nas for herself, she was left with as many sensations of comfort,\\nas were, perhaps, ever likely to be hers.  she knew herself to be\\nof the first utility to the child; and what was it to her\\nif frederick wentworth were only half a mile distant, making himself\\nagreeable to others?\\n\\nshe would have liked to know how he felt as to a meeting.\\nperhaps indifferent, if indifference could exist under such circumstances.\\nhe must be either indifferent or unwilling.  had he wished\\never to see her again, he need not have waited till this time;\\nhe would have done what she could not but believe that in his place\\nshe should have done long ago, when events had been early giving him\\nthe independence which alone had been wanting.\\n\\nher brother and sister came back delighted with their new acquaintance,\\nand their visit in general.  there had been music, singing,\\ntalking, laughing, all that was most agreeable; charming manners\\nin captain wentworth, no shyness or reserve; they seemed all\\nto know each other perfectly, and he was coming the very next morning\\nto shoot with charles.  he was to come to breakfast, but not at the cottage,\\nthough that had been proposed at first; but then he had been pressed\\nto come to the great house instead, and he seemed afraid of being\\nin mrs charles musgrove\\'s way, on account of the child, and therefore,\\nsomehow, they hardly knew how, it ended in charles\\'s being to meet him\\nto breakfast at his father\\'s.\\n\\nanne understood it.  he wished to avoid seeing her.  he had inquired\\nafter her, she found, slightly, as might suit a former slight acquaintance,\\nseeming to acknowledge such as she had acknowledged, actuated, perhaps,\\nby the same view of escaping introduction when they were to meet.\\n\\nthe morning hours of the cottage were always later than those\\nof the other house, and on the morrow the difference was so great\\nthat mary and anne were not more than beginning breakfast when\\ncharles came in to say that they were just setting off, that he was\\ncome for his dogs, that his sisters were following with captain wentworth;\\nhis sisters meaning to visit mary and the child, and captain wentworth\\nproposing also to wait on her for a few minutes if not inconvenient;\\nand though charles had answered for the child\\'s being in no such state\\nas could make it inconvenient, captain wentworth would not be satisfied\\nwithout his running on to give notice.\\n\\nmary, very much gratified by this attention, was delighted to receive him,\\nwhile a thousand feelings rushed on anne, of which this was\\nthe most consoling, that it would soon be over.  and it was soon over.\\nin two minutes after charles\\'s preparation, the others appeared;\\nthey were in the drawing-room.  her eye half met captain wentworth\\'s,\\na bow, a curtsey passed; she heard his voice; he talked to mary,\\nsaid all that was right, said something to the miss musgroves,\\nenough to mark an easy footing; the room seemed full, full of persons\\nand voices, but a few minutes ended it.  charles shewed himself\\nat the window, all was ready, their visitor had bowed and was gone,\\nthe miss musgroves were gone too, suddenly resolving to walk\\nto the end of the village with the sportsmen:  the room was cleared,\\nand anne might finish her breakfast as she could.\\n\\n\"it is over! it is over!\" she repeated to herself again and again,\\nin nervous gratitude.  \"the worst is over!\"\\n\\nmary talked, but she could not attend.  she had seen him.\\nthey had met.  they had been once more in the same room.\\n\\nsoon, however, she began to reason with herself, and try to be feeling less.\\neight years, almost eight years had passed, since all had been given up.\\nhow absurd to be resuming the agitation which such an interval\\nhad banished into distance and indistinctness!  what might not\\neight years do?  events of every description, changes, alienations,\\nremovals--all, all must be comprised in it, and oblivion of the past--\\nhow natural, how certain too!  it included nearly a third part\\nof her own life.\\n\\nalas! with all her reasoning, she found, that to retentive feelings\\neight years may be little more than nothing.\\n\\nnow, how were his sentiments to be read?  was this like\\nwishing to avoid her?  and the next moment she was hating herself\\nfor the folly which asked the question.\\n\\non one other question which perhaps her utmost wisdom\\nmight not have prevented, she was soon spared all suspense;\\nfor, after the miss musgroves had returned and finished their visit\\nat the cottage she had this spontaneous information from mary: --\\n\\n\"captain wentworth is not very gallant by you, anne, though he was\\nso attentive to me.  henrietta asked him what he thought of you,\\nwhen they went away, and he said, `you were so altered he should not\\nhave known you again.\\'\"\\n\\nmary had no feelings to make her respect her sister\\'s in a common way,\\nbut she was perfectly unsuspicious of being inflicting any peculiar wound.\\n\\n\"altered beyond his knowledge.\"  anne fully submitted, in silent,\\ndeep mortification.  doubtless it was so, and she could take no revenge,\\nfor he was not altered, or not for the worse.  she had already\\nacknowledged it to herself, and she could not think differently,\\nlet him think of her as he would.  no:  the years which had destroyed\\nher youth and bloom had only given him a more glowing, manly,\\nopen look, in no respect lessening his personal advantages.\\nshe had seen the same frederick wentworth.\\n\\n\"so altered that he should not have known her again!\"  these were words\\nwhich could not but dwell with her.  yet she soon began to rejoice\\nthat she had heard them.  they were of sobering tendency;\\nthey allayed agitation; they composed, and consequently must\\nmake her happier.\\n\\nfrederick wentworth had used such words, or something like them,\\nbut without an idea that they would be carried round to her.\\nhe had thought her wretchedly altered, and in the first moment of appeal,\\nhad spoken as he felt.  he had not forgiven anne elliot.\\nshe had used him ill, deserted and disappointed him; and worse,\\nshe had shewn a feebleness of character in doing so, which his own decided,\\nconfident temper could not endure.  she had given him up to oblige others.\\nit had been the effect of over-persuasion.  it had been\\nweakness and timidity.\\n\\nhe had been most warmly attached to her, and had never seen a woman since\\nwhom he thought her equal; but, except from some natural sensation\\nof curiosity, he had no desire of meeting her again.  her power with him\\nwas gone for ever.\\n\\nit was now his object to marry.  he was rich, and being turned on shore,\\nfully intended to settle as soon as he could be properly tempted;\\nactually looking round, ready to fall in love with all the speed\\nwhich a clear head and a quick taste could allow.  he had a heart\\nfor either of the miss musgroves, if they could catch it; a heart,\\nin short, for any pleasing young woman who came in his way,\\nexcepting anne elliot.  this was his only secret exception,\\nwhen he said to his sister, in answer to her suppositions:--\\n\\n\"yes, here i am, sophia, quite ready to make a foolish match.\\nanybody between fifteen and thirty may have me for asking.\\na little beauty, and a few smiles, and a few compliments to the navy,\\nand i am a lost man.  should not this be enough for a sailor,\\nwho has had no society among women to make him nice?\"\\n\\nhe said it, she knew, to be contradicted.  his bright proud eye\\nspoke the conviction that he was nice; and anne elliot was\\nnot out of his thoughts, when he more seriously described\\nthe woman he should wish to meet with.  \"a strong mind,\\nwith sweetness of manner,\" made the first and the last of the description.\\n\\n\"that is the woman i want,\" said he.  \"something a little inferior\\ni shall of course put up with, but it must not be much.  if i am a fool,\\ni shall be a fool indeed, for i have thought on the subject\\nmore than most men.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 8\\n\\n\\nfrom this time captain wentworth and anne elliot were repeatedly\\nin the same circle.  they were soon dining in company together\\nat mr musgrove\\'s, for the little boy\\'s state could no longer\\nsupply his aunt with a pretence for absenting herself; and this was\\nbut the beginning of other dinings and other meetings.\\n\\nwhether former feelings were to be renewed must be brought to the proof;\\nformer times must undoubtedly be brought to the recollection of each;\\nthey could not but be reverted to; the year of their engagement\\ncould not but be named by him, in the little narratives or descriptions\\nwhich conversation called forth.  his profession qualified him,\\nhis disposition lead him, to talk; and \"that was in the year six;\"\\n\"that happened before i went to sea in the year six,\" occurred\\nin the course of the first evening they spent together:\\nand though his voice did not falter, and though she had no reason\\nto suppose his eye wandering towards her while he spoke,\\nanne felt the utter impossibility, from her knowledge of his mind,\\nthat he could be unvisited by remembrance any more than herself.\\nthere must be the same immediate association of thought,\\nthough she was very far from conceiving it to be of equal pain.\\n\\nthey had no conversation together, no intercourse but what\\nthe commonest civility required.  once so much to each other!\\nnow nothing!  there had been a time, when of all the large party\\nnow filling the drawing-room at uppercross, they would have found it\\nmost difficult to cease to speak to one another.  with the exception,\\nperhaps, of admiral and mrs croft, who seemed particularly attached\\nand happy, (anne could allow no other exceptions even among\\nthe married couples), there could have been no two hearts so open,\\nno tastes so similar, no feelings so in unison, no countenances so beloved.\\nnow they were as strangers; nay, worse than strangers, for they could\\nnever become acquainted.  it was a perpetual estrangement.\\n\\nwhen he talked, she heard the same voice, and discerned the same mind.\\nthere was a very general ignorance of all naval matters throughout the party;\\nand he was very much questioned, and especially by the two miss musgroves,\\nwho seemed hardly to have any eyes but for him, as to the manner\\nof living on board, daily regulations, food, hours, &c., and their surprise\\nat his accounts, at learning the degree of accommodation and arrangement\\nwhich was practicable, drew from him some pleasant ridicule,\\nwhich reminded anne of the early days when she too had been ignorant,\\nand she too had been accused of supposing sailors to be living on board\\nwithout anything to eat, or any cook to dress it if there were,\\nor any servant to wait, or any knife and fork to use.\\n\\nfrom thus listening and thinking, she was roused by a whisper\\nof mrs musgrove\\'s who, overcome by fond regrets, could not help saying--\\n\\n\"ah! miss anne, if it had pleased heaven to spare my poor son,\\ni dare say he would have been just such another by this time.\"\\n\\nanne suppressed a smile, and listened kindly, while mrs musgrove\\nrelieved her heart a little more; and for a few minutes, therefore,\\ncould not keep pace with the conversation of the others.\\n\\nwhen she could let her attention take its natural course again,\\nshe found the miss musgroves just fetching the navy list\\n(their own navy list, the first that had ever been at uppercross),\\nand sitting down together to pore over it, with the professed view\\nof finding out the ships that captain wentworth had commanded.\\n\\n\"your first was the asp, i remember; we will look for the asp.\"\\n\\n\"you will not find her there.  quite worn out and broken up.\\ni was the last man who commanded her.  hardly fit for service then.\\nreported fit for home service for a year or two, and so i was sent off\\nto the west indies.\"\\n\\nthe girls looked all amazement.\\n\\n\"the admiralty,\" he continued, \"entertain themselves now and then,\\nwith sending a few hundred men to sea, in a ship not fit to be employed.\\nbut they have a great many to provide for; and among the thousands\\nthat may just as well go to the bottom as not, it is impossible\\nfor them to distinguish the very set who may be least missed.\"\\n\\n\"phoo! phoo!\" cried the admiral, \"what stuff these young fellows talk!\\nnever was a better sloop than the asp in her day.  for an old built sloop,\\nyou would not see her equal.  lucky fellow to get her!  he knows there\\nmust have been twenty better men than himself applying for her\\nat the same time.  lucky fellow to get anything so soon,\\nwith no more interest than his.\"\\n\\n\"i felt my luck, admiral, i assure you;\" replied captain wentworth,\\nseriously.  \"i was as well satisfied with my appointment as you can desire.\\nit was a great object with me at that time to be at sea;\\na very great object, i wanted to be doing something.\"\\n\\n\"to be sure you did.  what should a young fellow like you do ashore\\nfor half a year together?  if a man had not a wife, he soon wants\\nto be afloat again.\"\\n\\n\"but, captain wentworth,\" cried louisa, \"how vexed you must have been\\nwhen you came to the asp, to see what an old thing they had given you.\"\\n\\n\"i knew pretty well what she was before that day;\" said he, smiling.\\n\"i had no more discoveries to make than you would have as to\\nthe fashion and strength of any old pelisse, which you had seen\\nlent about among half your acquaintance ever since you could remember,\\nand which at last, on some very wet day, is lent to yourself.\\nah! she was a dear old asp to me.  she did all that i wanted.\\ni knew she would.  i knew that we should either go to the bottom together,\\nor that she would be the making of me; and i never had two days\\nof foul weather all the time i was at sea in her; and after\\ntaking privateers enough to be very entertaining, i had the good luck\\nin my passage home the next autumn, to fall in with the very french frigate\\ni wanted.  i brought her into plymouth; and here another instance of luck.\\nwe had not been six hours in the sound, when a gale came on,\\nwhich lasted four days and nights, and which would have done for\\npoor old asp in half the time; our touch with the great nation\\nnot having much improved our condition.  four-and-twenty hours later,\\nand i should only have been a gallant captain wentworth,\\nin a small paragraph at one corner of the newspapers; and being lost\\nin only a sloop, nobody would have thought about me.\" anne\\'s shudderings\\nwere to herself alone; but the miss musgroves could be as open\\nas they were sincere, in their exclamations of pity and horror.\\n\\n\"and so then, i suppose,\" said mrs musgrove, in a low voice,\\nas if thinking aloud, \"so then he went away to the laconia, and there\\nhe met with our poor boy. charles, my dear,\" (beckoning him to her),\\n\"do ask captain wentworth where it was he first met with your poor brother.\\ni always forgot.\"\\n\\n\"it was at gibraltar, mother, i know.  dick had been left ill at gibraltar,\\nwith a recommendation from his former captain to captain wentworth.\"\\n\\n\"oh! but, charles, tell captain wentworth, he need not be afraid\\nof mentioning poor dick before me, for it would be rather a pleasure\\nto hear him talked of by such a good friend.\"\\n\\ncharles, being somewhat more mindful of the probabilities of the case,\\nonly nodded in reply, and walked away.\\n\\nthe girls were now hunting for the laconia; and captain wentworth\\ncould not deny himself the pleasure of taking the precious volume\\ninto his own hands to save them the trouble, and once more read aloud\\nthe little statement of her name and rate, and present\\nnon-commissioned class, observing over it that she too had been\\none of the best friends man ever had.\\n\\n\"ah! those were pleasant days when i had the laconia!  how fast i\\nmade money in her.  a friend of mine and i had such a lovely cruise\\ntogether off the western islands.  poor harville, sister!\\nyou know how much he wanted money:  worse than myself.  he had a wife.\\nexcellent fellow.  i shall never forget his happiness.  he felt it all,\\nso much for her sake.  i wished for him again the next summer,\\nwhen i had still the same luck in the mediterranean.\"\\n\\n\"and i am sure, sir.\" said mrs musgrove, \"it was a lucky day for us,\\nwhen you were put captain into that ship.  we shall never forget\\nwhat you did.\"\\n\\nher feelings made her speak low; and captain wentworth,\\nhearing only in part, and probably not having dick musgrove at all\\nnear his thoughts, looked rather in suspense, and as if waiting for more.\\n\\n\"my brother,\" whispered one of the girls; \"mamma is thinking\\nof poor richard.\"\\n\\n\"poor dear fellow!\" continued mrs musgrove; \"he was grown so steady,\\nand such an excellent correspondent, while he was under your care!\\nah! it would have been a happy thing, if he had never left you.\\ni assure you, captain wentworth, we are very sorry he ever left you.\"\\n\\nthere was a momentary expression in captain wentworth\\'s face at this speech,\\na certain glance of his bright eye, and curl of his handsome mouth,\\nwhich convinced anne, that instead of sharing in mrs musgrove\\'s kind wishes,\\nas to her son, he had probably been at some pains to get rid of him;\\nbut it was too transient an indulgence of self-amusement to be detected\\nby any who understood him less than herself; in another moment\\nhe was perfectly collected and serious, and almost instantly afterwards\\ncoming up to the sofa, on which she and mrs musgrove were sitting,\\ntook a place by the latter, and entered into conversation with her,\\nin a low voice, about her son, doing it with so much sympathy\\nand natural grace, as shewed the kindest consideration for all\\nthat was real and unabsurd in the parent\\'s feelings.\\n\\nthey were actually on the same sofa, for mrs musgrove had\\nmost readily made room for him; they were divided only by mrs musgrove.\\nit was no insignificant barrier, indeed.  mrs musgrove was of\\na comfortable, substantial size, infinitely more fitted by nature\\nto express good cheer and good humour, than tenderness and sentiment;\\nand while the agitations of anne\\'s slender form, and pensive face,\\nmay be considered as very completely screened, captain wentworth\\nshould be allowed some credit for the self-command with which\\nhe attended to her large fat sighings over the destiny of a son,\\nwhom alive nobody had cared for.\\n\\npersonal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary proportions.\\na large bulky figure has as good a right to be in deep affliction,\\nas the most graceful set of limbs in the world.  but, fair or not fair,\\nthere are unbecoming conjunctions, which reason will patronize in vain--\\nwhich taste cannot tolerate--which ridicule will seize.\\n\\nthe admiral, after taking two or three refreshing turns about the room\\nwith his hands behind him, being called to order by his wife,\\nnow came up to captain wentworth, and without any observation\\nof what he might be interrupting, thinking only of his own thoughts,\\nbegan with--\\n\\n\"if you had been a week later at lisbon, last spring, frederick,\\nyou would have been asked to give a passage to lady mary grierson\\nand her daughters.\"\\n\\n\"should i?  i am glad i was not a week later then.\"\\n\\nthe admiral abused him for his want of gallantry.  he defended himself;\\nthough professing that he would never willingly admit any ladies\\non board a ship of his, excepting for a ball, or a visit,\\nwhich a few hours might comprehend.\\n\\n\"but, if i know myself,\" said he, \"this is from no want of gallantry\\ntowards them.  it is rather from feeling how impossible it is,\\nwith all one\\'s efforts, and all one\\'s sacrifices, to make\\nthe accommodations on board such as women ought to have.\\nthere can be no want of gallantry, admiral, in rating the claims of women\\nto every personal comfort high, and this is what i do.  i hate to hear\\nof women on board, or to see them on board; and no ship under my command\\nshall ever convey a family of ladies anywhere, if i can help it.\"\\n\\nthis brought his sister upon him.\\n\\n\"oh! frederick!  but i cannot believe it of you. --all idle refinement!\\n--women may be as comfortable on board, as in the best house in england.\\ni believe i have lived as much on board as most women, and i know\\nnothing superior to the accommodations of a man-of-war.  i declare\\ni have not a comfort or an indulgence about me, even at kellynch hall,\"\\n(with a kind bow to anne), \"beyond what i always had in most of\\nthe ships i have lived in; and they have been five altogether.\"\\n\\n\"nothing to the purpose,\" replied her brother.  \"you were living\\nwith your husband, and were the only woman on board.\"\\n\\n\"but you, yourself, brought mrs harville, her sister, her cousin,\\nand three children, round from portsmouth to plymouth.  where was this\\nsuperfine, extraordinary sort of gallantry of yours then?\"\\n\\n\"all merged in my friendship, sophia.  i would assist any\\nbrother officer\\'s wife that i could, and i would bring anything\\nof harville\\'s from the world\\'s end, if he wanted it.  but do not imagine\\nthat i did not feel it an evil in itself.\"\\n\\n\"depend upon it, they were all perfectly comfortable.\"\\n\\n\"i might not like them the better for that perhaps.  such a number\\nof women and children have no right to be comfortable on board.\"\\n\\n\"my dear frederick, you are talking quite idly.  pray, what would\\nbecome of us poor sailors\\' wives, who often want to be conveyed to\\none port or another, after our husbands, if everybody had your feelings?\"\\n\\n\"my feelings, you see, did not prevent my taking mrs harville\\nand all her family to plymouth.\"\\n\\n\"but i hate to hear you talking so like a fine gentleman,\\nand as if women were all fine ladies, instead of rational creatures.\\nwe none of us expect to be in smooth water all our days.\"\\n\\n\"ah! my dear,\" said the admiral, \"when he had got a wife,\\nhe will sing a different tune.  when he is married, if we have\\nthe good luck to live to another war, we shall see him do as you and i,\\nand a great many others, have done.  we shall have him very thankful\\nto anybody that will bring him his wife.\"\\n\\n\"ay, that we shall.\"\\n\\n\"now i have done,\" cried captain wentworth.  \"when once married\\npeople begin to attack me with,--`oh! you will think very differently,\\nwhen you are married.\\'  i can only say, `no, i shall not;\\' and then\\nthey say again, `yes, you will,\\' and there is an end of it.\"\\n\\nhe got up and moved away.\\n\\n\"what a great traveller you must have been, ma\\'am!\" said mrs musgrove\\nto mrs croft.\\n\\n\"pretty well, ma\\'am in the fifteen years of my marriage;\\nthough many women have done more.  i have crossed the atlantic\\nfour times, and have been once to the east indies, and back again,\\nand only once; besides being in different places about home:\\ncork, and lisbon, and gibraltar.  but i never went beyond the streights,\\nand never was in the west indies.  we do not call bermuda or bahama,\\nyou know, the west indies.\"\\n\\nmrs musgrove had not a word to say in dissent; she could not accuse herself\\nof having ever called them anything in the whole course of her life.\\n\\n\"and i do assure you, ma\\'am,\" pursued mrs croft, \"that nothing can exceed\\nthe accommodations of a man-of-war; i speak, you know, of the higher rates.\\nwhen you come to a frigate, of course, you are more confined;\\nthough any reasonable woman may be perfectly happy in one of them;\\nand i can safely say, that the happiest part of my life has been spent\\non board a ship.  while we were together, you know, there was nothing\\nto be feared.  thank god!  i have always been blessed with\\nexcellent health, and no climate disagrees with me.  a little disordered\\nalways the first twenty-four hours of going to sea, but never knew\\nwhat sickness was afterwards.  the only time i ever really suffered\\nin body or mind, the only time that i ever fancied myself unwell,\\nor had any ideas of danger, was the winter that i passed by myself at deal,\\nwhen the admiral (captain croft then) was in the north seas.\\ni lived in perpetual fright at that time, and had all manner of\\nimaginary complaints from not knowing what to do with myself,\\nor when i should hear from him next; but as long as we could be together,\\nnothing ever ailed me, and i never met with the smallest inconvenience.\"\\n\\n\"aye, to be sure.  yes, indeed, oh yes!  i am quite of your opinion,\\nmrs croft,\" was mrs musgrove\\'s hearty answer.  \"there is nothing so bad\\nas a separation.  i am quite of your opinion.  i know what it is,\\nfor mr musgrove always attends the assizes, and i am so glad when\\nthey are over, and he is safe back again.\"\\n\\nthe evening ended with dancing.  on its being proposed,\\nanne offered her services, as usual; and though her eyes would sometimes\\nfill with tears as she sat at the instrument, she was extremely glad\\nto be employed, and desired nothing in return but to be unobserved.\\n\\nit was a merry, joyous party, and no one seemed in higher spirits\\nthan captain wentworth.  she felt that he had every thing to elevate\\nhim which general attention and deference, and especially the attention\\nof all the young women, could do.  the miss hayters, the females\\nof the family of cousins already mentioned, were apparently admitted\\nto the honour of being in love with him; and as for henrietta and louisa,\\nthey both seemed so entirely occupied by him, that nothing but\\nthe continued appearance of the most perfect good-will between themselves\\ncould have made it credible that they were not decided rivals.\\nif he were a little spoilt by such universal, such eager admiration,\\nwho could wonder?\\n\\nthese were some of the thoughts which occupied anne, while her fingers\\nwere mechanically at work, proceeding for half an hour together,\\nequally without error, and without consciousness.  once she felt\\nthat he was looking at herself,  observing her altered features,\\nperhaps, trying to trace in them the ruins of the face which had once\\ncharmed him; and once she knew that he must have spoken of her;\\nshe was hardly aware of it, till she heard the answer; but then she was\\nsure of his having asked his partner whether miss elliot never danced?\\nthe answer was, \"oh, no; never; she has quite given up dancing.\\nshe had rather play.  she is never tired of playing.\"  once, too,\\nhe spoke to her.  she had left the instrument on the dancing being over,\\nand he had sat down to try to make out an air which he wished\\nto give the miss musgroves an idea of.  unintentionally she returned\\nto that part of the room; he saw her, and, instantly rising,\\nsaid, with studied politeness--\\n\\n\"i beg your pardon, madam, this is your seat;\" and though she immediately\\ndrew back with a decided negative, he was not to be induced\\nto sit down again.\\n\\nanne did not wish for more of such looks and speeches.\\nhis cold politeness, his ceremonious grace, were worse than anything.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 9\\n\\n\\ncaptain wentworth was come to kellynch as to a home, to stay\\nas long as he liked, being as thoroughly the object of\\nthe admiral\\'s fraternal kindness as of his wife\\'s.  he had intended,\\non first arriving, to proceed very soon into shropshire,\\nand visit the brother settled in that country, but the attractions\\nof uppercross induced him to put this off.  there was so much\\nof friendliness, and of flattery, and of everything most bewitching\\nin his reception there; the old were so hospitable, the young so agreeable,\\nthat he could not but resolve to remain where he was, and take all\\nthe charms and perfections of edward\\'s wife upon credit a little longer.\\n\\nit was soon uppercross with him almost every day.  the musgroves\\ncould hardly be more ready to invite than he to come, particularly\\nin the morning, when he had no companion at home, for the admiral\\nand mrs croft were generally out of doors together, interesting themselves\\nin their new possessions, their grass, and their sheep, and dawdling about\\nin a way not endurable to a third person, or driving out in a gig,\\nlately added to their establishment.\\n\\nhitherto there had been but one opinion of captain wentworth\\namong the musgroves and their dependencies.  it was unvarying,\\nwarm admiration everywhere; but this intimate footing was not more\\nthan established, when a certain charles hayter returned among them,\\nto be a good deal disturbed by it, and to think captain wentworth\\nvery much in the way.\\n\\ncharles hayter was the eldest of all the cousins, and a very amiable,\\npleasing young man, between whom and henrietta there had been\\na considerable appearance of attachment previous to captain wentworth\\'s\\nintroduction.  he was in orders; and having a curacy in the neighbourhood,\\nwhere residence was not required, lived at his father\\'s house,\\nonly two miles from uppercross.  a short absence from home\\nhad left his fair one unguarded by his attentions at this critical period,\\nand when he came back he had the pain of finding very altered manners,\\nand of seeing captain wentworth.\\n\\nmrs musgrove and mrs hayter were sisters.  they had each had money,\\nbut their marriages had made a material difference in\\ntheir degree of consequence.  mr hayter had some property of his own,\\nbut it was insignificant compared with mr musgrove\\'s; and while\\nthe musgroves were in the first class of society in the country,\\nthe young hayters would, from their parents\\' inferior, retired,\\nand unpolished way of living, and their own defective education,\\nhave been hardly in any class at all, but for their connexion\\nwith uppercross, this eldest son of course excepted, who had chosen\\nto be a scholar and a gentleman, and who was very superior\\nin cultivation and manners to all the rest.\\n\\nthe two families had always been on excellent terms, there being no pride\\non one side, and no envy on the other, and only such a consciousness\\nof superiority in the miss musgroves, as made them pleased\\nto improve their cousins.  charles\\'s attentions to henrietta\\nhad been observed by her father and mother without any disapprobation.\\n\"it would not be a great match for her; but if henrietta liked him,\"--\\nand henrietta did seem to like him.\\n\\nhenrietta fully thought so herself, before captain wentworth came;\\nbut from that time cousin charles had been very much forgotten.\\n\\nwhich of the two sisters was preferred by captain wentworth was\\nas yet quite doubtful, as far as anne\\'s observation reached.\\nhenrietta was perhaps the prettiest, louisa had the higher spirits;\\nand she knew not now, whether the more gentle or the more lively character\\nwere most likely to attract him.\\n\\nmr and mrs musgrove, either from seeing little, or from\\nan entire confidence in the discretion of both their daughters,\\nand of all the young men who came near them, seemed to leave everything\\nto take its chance.  there was not the smallest appearance of solicitude\\nor remark about them in the mansion-house; but it was different\\nat the cottage:  the young couple there were more disposed\\nto speculate and wonder; and captain wentworth had not been above\\nfour or five times in the miss musgroves\\' company, and charles hayter\\nhad but just reappeared, when anne had to listen to the opinions\\nof her brother and sister, as to which was the one liked best.\\ncharles gave it for louisa, mary for henrietta, but quite agreeing\\nthat to have him marry either could be extremely delightful.\\n\\ncharles \"had never seen a pleasanter man in his life; and from what\\nhe had once heard captain wentworth himself say, was very sure that\\nhe had not made less than twenty thousand pounds by the war.\\nhere was a fortune at once; besides which, there would be the chance\\nof what might be done in any future war; and he was sure captain wentworth\\nwas as likely a man to distinguish himself as any officer in the navy.\\noh! it would be a capital match for either of his sisters.\"\\n\\n\"upon my word it would,\" replied mary.  \"dear me!  if he should\\nrise to any very great honours!  if he should ever be made a baronet!\\n`lady wentworth\\' sounds very well.  that would be a noble thing,\\nindeed, for henrietta!  she would take place of me then, and henrietta\\nwould not dislike that.  sir frederick and lady wentworth!\\nit would be but a new creation, however, and i never think much\\nof your new creations.\"\\n\\nit suited mary best to think henrietta the one preferred\\non the very account of charles hayter, whose pretensions she wished\\nto see put an end to.  she looked down very decidedly upon the hayters,\\nand thought it would be quite a misfortune to have the existing connection\\nbetween the families renewed--very sad for herself and her children.\\n\\n\"you know,\" said she, \"i cannot think him at all a fit match for henrietta;\\nand considering the alliances which the musgroves have made,\\nshe has no right to throw herself away.  i do not think any young woman\\nhas a right to make a choice that may be disagreeable and inconvenient\\nto the principal part of her family, and be giving bad connections\\nto those who have not been used to them.  and, pray, who is charles hayter?\\nnothing but a country curate.  a most improper match for miss musgrove\\nof uppercross.\"\\n\\nher husband, however, would not agree with her here; for besides having\\na regard for his cousin, charles hayter was an eldest son,\\nand he saw things as an eldest son himself.\\n\\n\"now you are taking nonsense, mary,\" was therefore his answer.\\n\"it would not be a great match for henrietta, but charles has\\na very fair chance, through the spicers, of getting something from\\nthe bishop in the course of a year or two; and you will please to remember,\\nthat he is the eldest son; whenever my uncle dies, he steps into very\\npretty property.  the estate at winthrop is not less than\\ntwo hundred and fifty acres, besides the farm near taunton,\\nwhich is some of the best land in the country.  i grant you,\\nthat any of them but charles would be a very shocking match for henrietta,\\nand indeed it could not be; he is the only one that could be possible;\\nbut he is a very good-natured, good sort of a fellow; and whenever winthrop\\ncomes into his hands, he will make a different sort of place of it,\\nand live in a very different sort of way; and with that property,\\nhe will never be a contemptible man--good, freehold property.  no, no;\\nhenrietta might do worse than marry charles hayter; and if she has him,\\nand louisa can get captain wentworth, i shall be very well satisfied.\"\\n\\n\"charles may say what he pleases,\" cried mary to anne, as soon as\\nhe was out of the room, \"but it would be shocking to have henrietta\\nmarry charles hayter; a very bad thing for her, and still worse\\nfor me; and therefore it is very much to be wished that captain wentworth\\nmay soon put him quite out of her head, and i have very little doubt\\nthat he has.  she took hardly any notice of charles hayter yesterday.\\ni wish you had been there to see her behaviour.  and as to\\ncaptain wentworth\\'s liking louisa as well as henrietta, it is nonsense\\nto say so; for he certainly does like henrietta a great deal the best.\\nbut charles is so positive!  i wish you had been with us yesterday,\\nfor then you might have decided between us; and i am sure you\\nwould have thought as i did, unless you had been determined\\nto give it against me.\"\\n\\na dinner at mr musgrove\\'s had been the occasion when all these things\\nshould have been seen by anne; but she had staid at home,\\nunder the mixed plea of a headache of her own, and some return\\nof indisposition in little charles.  she had thought only of avoiding\\ncaptain wentworth; but an escape from being appealed to as umpire\\nwas now added to the advantages of a quiet evening.\\n\\nas to captain wentworth\\'s views, she deemed it of more consequence\\nthat he should know his own mind early enough not to be endangering\\nthe happiness of either sister, or impeaching his own honour,\\nthan that he should prefer henrietta to louisa, or louisa to henrietta.\\neither of them would, in all probability, make him an affectionate,\\ngood-humoured wife.  with regard to charles hayter, she had delicacy\\nwhich must be pained by any lightness of conduct in a well-meaning\\nyoung woman, and a heart to sympathize in any of the sufferings\\nit occasioned; but if henrietta found herself mistaken in the nature\\nof her feelings, the alternation could not be understood too soon.\\n\\ncharles hayter had met with much to disquiet and mortify him\\nin his cousin\\'s behaviour.  she had too old a regard for him\\nto be so wholly estranged as might in two meetings extinguish\\nevery past hope, and leave him nothing to do but to keep away\\nfrom uppercross:  but there was such a change as became very alarming,\\nwhen such a man as captain wentworth was to be regarded as\\nthe probable cause.  he had been absent only two sundays,\\nand when they parted, had left her interested, even to the height\\nof his wishes, in his prospect of soon quitting his present curacy,\\nand obtaining that of uppercross instead.  it had then seemed the object\\nnearest her heart, that dr shirley, the rector, who for more than\\nforty years had been zealously discharging all the duties of his office,\\nbut was now growing too infirm for many of them, should be quite fixed\\non engaging a curate; should make his curacy quite as good\\nas he could afford, and should give charles hayter the promise of it.\\nthe advantage of his having to come only to uppercross, instead of going\\nsix miles another way; of his having, in every respect, a better curacy;\\nof his belonging to their dear dr shirley, and of dear, good dr shirley\\'s\\nbeing relieved from the duty which he could no longer get through\\nwithout most injurious fatigue, had been a great deal, even to louisa,\\nbut had been almost everything to henrietta.  when he came back, alas!\\nthe zeal of the business was gone by.  louisa could not listen at all\\nto his account of a conversation which he had just held with dr shirley:\\nshe was at a window, looking out for captain wentworth; and even henrietta\\nhad at best only a divided attention to give, and seemed to have forgotten\\nall the former doubt and solicitude of the negotiation.\\n\\n\"well, i am very glad indeed:  but i always thought you would have it;\\ni always thought you sure.  it did not appear to me that--in short,\\nyou know, dr shirley must have a curate, and you had secured his promise.\\nis he coming, louisa?\"\\n\\none morning, very soon after the dinner at the musgroves,\\nat which anne had not been present, captain wentworth walked into\\nthe drawing-room at the cottage, where were only herself and the little\\ninvalid charles, who was lying on the sofa.\\n\\nthe surprise of finding himself almost alone with anne elliot,\\ndeprived his manners of their usual composure:  he started,\\nand could only say, \"i thought the miss musgroves had been here:\\nmrs musgrove told me i should find them here,\" before he walked\\nto the window to recollect himself, and feel how he ought to behave.\\n\\n\"they are up stairs with my sister:  they will be down in a few moments,\\ni dare say,\" had been anne\\'s reply, in all the confusion that was natural;\\nand if the child had not called her to come and do something for him,\\nshe would have been out of the room the next moment, and released\\ncaptain wentworth as well as herself.\\n\\nhe continued at the window; and after calmly and politely saying,\\n\"i hope the little boy is better,\" was silent.\\n\\nshe was obliged to kneel down by the sofa, and remain there\\nto satisfy her patient; and thus they continued a few minutes,\\nwhen, to her very great satisfaction, she heard some other person\\ncrossing the little vestibule.  she hoped, on turning her head,\\nto see the master of the house; but it proved to be one\\nmuch less calculated for making matters easy--charles hayter,\\nprobably not at all better pleased by the sight of captain wentworth\\nthan captain wentworth had been by the sight of anne.\\n\\nshe only attempted to say, \"how do you do?  will you not sit down?\\nthe others will be here presently.\"\\n\\ncaptain wentworth, however, came from his window, apparently\\nnot ill-disposed for conversation; but charles hayter soon put an end\\nto his attempts by seating himself near the table, and taking up\\nthe newspaper; and captain wentworth returned to his window.\\n\\nanother minute brought another addition.  the younger boy,\\na remarkable stout, forward child, of two years old, having got the door\\nopened for him by some one without, made his determined appearance\\namong them, and went straight to the sofa to see what was going on,\\nand put in his claim to anything good that might be giving away.\\n\\nthere being nothing to eat, he could only have some play;\\nand as his aunt would not let him tease his sick brother,\\nhe began to fasten himself upon her, as she knelt, in such a way that,\\nbusy as she was about charles, she could not shake him off.\\nshe spoke to him, ordered, entreated, and insisted in vain.\\nonce she did contrive to push him away, but the boy had\\nthe greater pleasure in getting upon her back again directly.\\n\\n\"walter,\" said she, \"get down this moment.  you are extremely troublesome.\\ni am very angry with you.\"\\n\\n\"walter,\" cried charles hayter, \"why do you not do as you are bid?\\ndo not you hear your aunt speak?  come to me, walter, come to\\ncousin charles.\"\\n\\nbut not a bit did walter stir.\\n\\nin another moment, however, she found herself in the state of\\nbeing released from him; some one was taking him from her,\\nthough he had bent down her head so much, that his little sturdy hands\\nwere unfastened from around her neck, and he was resolutely borne away,\\nbefore she knew that captain wentworth had done it.\\n\\nher sensations on the discovery made her perfectly speechless.\\nshe could not even thank him.  she could only hang over little charles,\\nwith most disordered feelings.  his kindness in stepping forward\\nto her relief, the manner, the silence in which it had passed,\\nthe little particulars of the circumstance, with the conviction soon\\nforced on her by the noise he was studiously making with the child,\\nthat he meant to avoid hearing her thanks, and rather sought\\nto testify that her conversation was the last of his wants,\\nproduced such a confusion of varying, but very painful agitation,\\nas she could not recover from, till enabled by the entrance of mary\\nand the miss musgroves to make over her little patient to their cares,\\nand leave the room.  she could not stay.  it might have been\\nan opportunity of watching the loves and jealousies of the four--\\nthey were now altogether; but she could stay for none of it.\\nit was evident that charles hayter was not well inclined towards\\ncaptain wentworth.  she had a strong impression of his having said,\\nin a vext tone of voice, after captain wentworth\\'s interference,\\n\"you ought to have minded me, walter; i told you not to teaze your aunt;\"\\nand could comprehend his regretting that captain wentworth should do\\nwhat he ought to have done himself.  but neither charles hayter\\'s feelings,\\nnor anybody\\'s feelings, could interest her, till she had a little better\\narranged her own.  she was ashamed of herself, quite ashamed\\nof being so nervous, so overcome by such a trifle; but so it was,\\nand it required a long application of solitude and reflection\\nto recover her.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 10\\n\\n\\nother opportunities of making her observations could not fail to occur.\\nanne had soon been in company with all the four together often enough\\nto have an opinion, though too wise to acknowledge as much at home,\\nwhere she knew it would have satisfied neither husband nor wife;\\nfor while she considered louisa to be rather the favourite,\\nshe could not but think, as far as she might dare to judge from memory\\nand experience, that captain wentworth was not in love with either.\\nthey were more in love with him; yet there it was not love.\\nit was a little fever of admiration; but it might, probably must,\\nend in love with some.  charles hayter seemed aware of being slighted,\\nand yet henrietta had sometimes the air of being divided between them.\\nanne longed for the power of representing to them all what they were about,\\nand of pointing out some of the evils they were exposing themselves to.\\nshe did not attribute guile to any.  it was the highest satisfaction\\nto her to believe captain wentworth not in the least aware\\nof the pain he was occasioning.  there was no triumph, no pitiful triumph\\nin his manner.  he had, probably, never heard, and never thought of\\nany claims of charles hayter.  he was only wrong in accepting\\nthe attentions (for accepting must be the word) of two young women at once.\\n\\nafter a short struggle, however, charles hayter seemed to quit the field.\\nthree days had passed without his coming once to uppercross;\\na most decided change.  he had even refused one regular invitation to dinner;\\nand having been found on the occasion by mr musgrove with some large books\\nbefore him, mr and mrs musgrove were sure all could not be right,\\nand talked, with grave faces, of his studying himself to death.\\nit was mary\\'s hope and belief that he had received a positive dismissal\\nfrom henrietta, and her husband lived under the constant dependence\\nof seeing him to-morrow.  anne could only feel that charles hayter\\nwas wise.\\n\\none morning, about this time charles musgrove and captain wentworth\\nbeing gone a-shooting together, as the sisters in the cottage\\nwere sitting quietly at work, they were visited at the window\\nby the sisters from the mansion-house.\\n\\nit was a very fine november day, and the miss musgroves came\\nthrough the little grounds, and stopped for no other purpose than to say,\\nthat they were going to take a long walk, and therefore concluded\\nmary could not like to go with them; and when mary immediately replied,\\nwith some jealousy at not being supposed a good walker, \"oh, yes,\\ni should like to join you very much, i am very fond of a long walk;\"\\nanne felt persuaded, by the looks of the two girls, that it was precisely\\nwhat they did not wish, and admired again the sort of necessity\\nwhich the family habits seemed to produce, of everything being\\nto be communicated, and everything being to be done together,\\nhowever undesired and inconvenient.  she tried to dissuade mary from going,\\nbut in vain; and that being the case, thought it best to accept\\nthe miss musgroves\\' much more cordial invitation to herself to go likewise,\\nas she might be useful in turning back with her sister, and lessening\\nthe interference in any plan of their own.\\n\\n\"i cannot imagine why they should suppose i should not like a long walk,\"\\nsaid mary, as she went up stairs.  \"everybody is always supposing\\nthat i am not a good walker; and yet they would not have been pleased,\\nif we had refused to join them.  when people come in this manner\\non purpose to ask us, how can one say no?\"\\n\\njust as they were setting off, the gentlemen returned.  they had taken out\\na young dog, who had spoilt their sport, and sent them back early.\\ntheir time and strength, and spirits, were, therefore, exactly ready\\nfor this walk, and they entered into it with pleasure.  could anne\\nhave foreseen such a junction, she would have staid at home; but,\\nfrom some feelings of interest and curiosity, she fancied now that it was\\ntoo late to retract, and the whole six set forward together\\nin the direction chosen by the miss musgroves, who evidently\\nconsidered the walk as under their guidance.\\n\\nanne\\'s object was, not to be in the way of anybody; and where\\nthe narrow paths across the fields made many separations necessary,\\nto keep with her brother and sister.  her pleasure in the walk\\nmust arise from the exercise and the day, from the view of\\nthe last smiles of the year upon the tawny leaves, and withered hedges,\\nand from repeating to herself some few of the thousand poetical\\ndescriptions extant of autumn, that season of peculiar and\\ninexhaustible influence on the mind of taste and tenderness,\\nthat season which had drawn from every poet, worthy of being read,\\nsome attempt at description, or some lines of feeling.\\nshe occupied her mind as much as possible in such like musings\\nand quotations; but it was not possible, that when within reach\\nof captain wentworth\\'s conversation with either of the miss musgroves,\\nshe should not try to hear it; yet she caught little very remarkable.\\nit was mere lively chat, such as any young persons, on an intimate footing,\\nmight fall into.  he was more engaged with louisa than with henrietta.\\nlouisa certainly put more forward for his notice than her sister.\\nthis distinction appeared to increase, and there was one speech\\nof louisa\\'s which struck her.  after one of the many praises of the day,\\nwhich were continually bursting forth, captain wentworth added: --\\n\\n\"what glorious weather for the admiral and my sister!  they meant to take\\na long drive this morning; perhaps we may hail them from\\nsome of these hills.  they talked of coming into this side of the country.\\ni wonder whereabouts they will upset to-day.  oh! it does happen\\nvery often, i assure you; but my sister makes nothing of it;\\nshe would as lieve be tossed out as not.\"\\n\\n\"ah! you make the most of it, i know,\" cried louisa, \"but if it were\\nreally so, i should do just the same in her place.  if i loved a man,\\nas she loves the admiral, i would always be with him, nothing should ever\\nseparate us, and i would rather be overturned by him, than driven safely\\nby anybody else.\"\\n\\nit was spoken with enthusiasm.\\n\\n\"had you?\" cried he, catching the same tone; \"i honour you!\"\\nand there was silence between them for a little while.\\n\\nanne could not immediately fall into a quotation again.  the sweet scenes\\nof autumn were for a while put by, unless some tender sonnet,\\nfraught with the apt analogy of the declining year, with declining\\nhappiness, and the images of youth and hope, and spring, all gone together,\\nblessed her memory.  she roused herself to say, as they struck by order\\ninto another path, \"is not this one of the ways to winthrop?\"\\nbut nobody heard, or, at least, nobody answered her.\\n\\nwinthrop, however, or its environs--for young men are, sometimes\\nto be met with, strolling about near home--was their destination;\\nand after another half mile of gradual ascent through large enclosures,\\nwhere the ploughs at work, and the fresh made path spoke the farmer\\ncounteracting the sweets of poetical despondence, and meaning\\nto have spring again, they gained the summit of the most considerable hill,\\nwhich parted uppercross and winthrop, and soon commanded a full view\\nof the latter, at the foot of the hill on the other side.\\n\\nwinthrop, without beauty and without dignity, was stretched before them\\nan indifferent house, standing low, and hemmed in by the barns and\\nbuildings of a farm-yard.\\n\\nmary exclaimed, \"bless me! here is winthrop.  i declare i had no idea!\\nwell now, i think we had better turn back; i am excessively tired.\"\\n\\nhenrietta, conscious and ashamed, and seeing no cousin charles\\nwalking along any path, or leaning against any gate, was ready\\nto do as mary wished; but \"no!\" said charles musgrove, and \"no, no!\"\\ncried louisa more eagerly, and taking her sister aside, seemed to be\\narguing the matter warmly.\\n\\ncharles, in the meanwhile, was very decidedly declaring his resolution\\nof calling on his aunt, now that he was so near; and very evidently,\\nthough more fearfully, trying to induce his wife to go too.\\nbut this was one of the points on which the lady shewed her strength;\\nand when he recommended the advantage of resting herself a quarter\\nof an hour at winthrop, as she felt so tired, she resolutely answered,\\n\"oh! no, indeed! walking up that hill again would do her more harm\\nthan any sitting down could do her good;\" and, in short,\\nher look and manner declared, that go she would not.\\n\\nafter a little succession of these sort of debates and consultations,\\nit was settled between charles and his two sisters, that he\\nand henrietta should just run down for a few minutes, to see their aunt\\nand cousins, while the rest of the party waited for them at the top\\nof the hill.  louisa seemed the principal arranger of the plan;\\nand, as she went a little way with them, down the hill, still talking\\nto henrietta, mary took the opportunity of looking scornfully around her,\\nand saying to captain wentworth--\\n\\n\"it is very unpleasant, having such connexions!  but, i assure you,\\ni have never been in the house above twice in my life.\"\\n\\nshe received no other answer, than an artificial, assenting smile,\\nfollowed by a contemptuous glance, as he turned away, which anne\\nperfectly knew the meaning of.\\n\\nthe brow of the hill, where they remained, was a cheerful spot:\\nlouisa returned; and mary, finding a comfortable seat for herself\\non the step of a stile, was very well satisfied so long as the others\\nall stood about her; but when louisa drew captain wentworth away,\\nto try for a gleaning of nuts in an adjoining hedge-row,\\nand they were gone by degrees quite out of sight and sound,\\nmary was happy no longer; she quarrelled with her own seat,\\nwas sure louisa had got a much better somewhere, and nothing could\\nprevent her from going to look for a better also.  she turned through\\nthe same gate, but could not see them.  anne found a nice seat\\nfor her, on a dry sunny bank, under the hedge-row, in which\\nshe had no doubt of their still being, in some spot or other.\\nmary sat down for a moment, but it would not do; she was sure louisa\\nhad found a better seat somewhere else, and she would go on\\ntill she overtook her.\\n\\nanne, really tired herself, was glad to sit down; and she very soon heard\\ncaptain wentworth and louisa in the hedge-row, behind her, as if\\nmaking their way back along the rough, wild sort of channel, down the\\ncentre.  they were speaking as they drew near.  louisa\\'s voice was\\nthe first distinguished.  she seemed to be in the middle of some\\neager speech.  what anne first heard was--\\n\\n\"and so, i made her go.  i could not bear that she should be frightened\\nfrom the visit by such nonsense.  what! would i be turned back from\\ndoing a thing that i had determined to do, and that i knew to be right,\\nby the airs and interference of such a person, or of any person i may say?\\nno, i have no idea of being so easily persuaded.  when i have\\nmade up my mind, i have made it; and henrietta seemed entirely\\nto have made up hers to call at winthrop to-day; and yet, she was as near\\ngiving it up, out of nonsensical complaisance!\"\\n\\n\"she would have turned back then, but for you?\"\\n\\n\"she would indeed.  i am almost ashamed to say it.\"\\n\\n\"happy for her, to have such a mind as yours at hand!  after the hints\\nyou gave just now, which did but confirm my own observations,\\nthe last time i was in company with him,  i need not affect\\nto have no comprehension of what is going on.  i see that more than\\na mere dutiful morning visit to your aunt was in question;\\nand woe betide him, and her too, when it comes to things of consequence,\\nwhen they are placed in circumstances requiring fortitude and\\nstrength of mind, if she have not resolution enough to resist\\nidle interference in such a trifle as this.  your sister is\\nan amiable creature; but yours is the character of decision and firmness,\\ni see.  if you value her conduct or happiness, infuse as much\\nof your own spirit into her as you can.  but this, no doubt,\\nyou have been always doing.  it is the worst evil of too yielding\\nand indecisive a character, that no influence over it can be depended on.\\nyou are never sure of a good impression being durable; everybody\\nmay sway it.  let those who would be happy be firm.  here is a nut,\"\\nsaid he, catching one down from an upper bough.  \"to exemplify:\\na beautiful glossy nut, which, blessed with original strength,\\nhas outlived all the storms of autumn.  not a puncture, not\\na weak spot anywhere.  this nut,\" he continued, with playful solemnity,\\n\"while so many of his brethren have fallen and been trodden under foot,\\nis still in possession of all the happiness that a hazel nut can be\\nsupposed capable of.\"  then returning to his former earnest tone--\\n\"my first wish for all whom i am interested in, is that they should be firm.\\nif louisa musgrove would be beautiful and happy in her november of life,\\nshe will cherish all her present powers of mind.\"\\n\\nhe had done, and was unanswered.  it would have surprised anne if louisa\\ncould have readily answered such a speech:  words of such interest,\\nspoken with such serious warmth!  she could imagine what louisa was feeling.\\nfor herself, she feared to move, lest she should be seen.\\nwhile she remained, a bush of low rambling holly protected her,\\nand they were moving on.  before they were beyond her hearing,\\nhowever, louisa spoke again.\\n\\n\"mary is good-natured enough in many respects,\" said she;\\n\"but she does sometimes provoke me excessively, by her nonsense\\nand pride--the elliot pride.  she has a great deal too much\\nof the elliot pride.  we do so wish that charles had married anne instead.\\ni suppose you know he wanted to marry anne?\"\\n\\nafter a moment\\'s pause, captain wentworth said--\\n\\n\"do you mean that she refused him?\"\\n\\n\"oh! yes; certainly.\"\\n\\n\"when did that happen?\"\\n\\n\"i do not exactly know, for henrietta and i were at school at the time;\\nbut i believe about a year before he married mary.  i wish she had\\naccepted him.  we should all have liked her a great deal better;\\nand papa and mamma always think it was her great friend\\nlady russell\\'s doing, that she did not.  they think charles\\nmight not be learned and bookish enough to please lady russell,\\nand that therefore, she persuaded anne to refuse him.\"\\n\\nthe sounds were retreating, and anne distinguished no more.\\nher own emotions still kept her fixed.  she had much to recover from,\\nbefore she could move.  the listener\\'s proverbial fate was\\nnot absolutely hers; she had heard no evil of herself, but she had heard\\na great deal of very painful import.  she saw how her own character\\nwas considered by captain wentworth, and there had been just that degree\\nof feeling and curiosity about her in his manner which must give her\\nextreme agitation.\\n\\nas soon as she could, she went after mary, and having found,\\nand walked back with her to their former station, by the stile,\\nfelt some comfort in their whole party being immediately afterwards\\ncollected, and once more in motion together.  her spirits wanted\\nthe solitude and silence which only numbers could give.\\n\\ncharles and henrietta returned, bringing, as may be conjectured,\\ncharles hayter with them.  the minutiae of the business anne\\ncould not attempt to understand; even captain wentworth did not seem\\nadmitted to perfect confidence here; but that there had been a withdrawing\\non the gentleman\\'s side, and a relenting on the lady\\'s, and that they\\nwere now very glad to be together again, did not admit a doubt.\\nhenrietta looked a little ashamed, but very well pleased;--\\ncharles hayter exceedingly happy:  and they were devoted to each other\\nalmost from the first instant of their all setting forward for uppercross.\\n\\neverything now marked out louisa for captain wentworth;\\nnothing could be plainer; and where many divisions were necessary,\\nor even where they were not, they walked side by side nearly as much\\nas the other two.  in a long strip of meadow land, where there was\\nample space for all, they were thus divided, forming three distinct parties;\\nand to that party of the three which boasted least animation,\\nand least complaisance, anne necessarily belonged.  she joined charles\\nand mary, and was tired enough to be very glad of charles\\'s other arm;\\nbut charles, though in very good humour with her, was out of temper\\nwith his wife.  mary had shewn herself disobliging to him,\\nand was now to reap the consequence, which consequence was\\nhis dropping her arm almost every moment to cut off the heads\\nof some nettles in the hedge with his switch; and when mary began\\nto complain of it, and lament her being ill-used, according to custom,\\nin being on the hedge side, while anne was never incommoded on the other,\\nhe dropped the arms of both to hunt after a weasel which he had\\na momentary glance of, and they could hardly get him along at all.\\n\\nthis long meadow bordered a lane, which their footpath, at the end of it\\nwas to cross, and when the party had all reached the gate of exit,\\nthe carriage advancing in the same direction, which had been\\nsome time heard, was just coming up, and proved to be admiral croft\\'s gig.\\nhe and his wife had taken their intended drive, and were returning home.\\nupon hearing how long a walk the young people had engaged in,\\nthey kindly offered a seat to any lady who might be particularly tired;\\nit would save her a full mile, and they were going through uppercross.\\nthe invitation was general, and generally declined.  the miss musgroves\\nwere not at all tired, and mary was either offended, by not being asked\\nbefore any of the others, or what louisa called the elliot pride\\ncould not endure to make a third in a one horse chaise.\\n\\nthe walking party had crossed the lane, and were surmounting an\\nopposite stile, and the admiral was putting his horse in motion again,\\nwhen captain wentworth cleared the hedge in a moment to say something\\nto his sister.  the something might be guessed by its effects.\\n\\n\"miss elliot, i am sure you are tired,\" cried mrs croft.\\n\"do let us have the pleasure of taking you home.  here is excellent room\\nfor three, i assure you.  if we were all like you, i believe we might\\nsit four.  you must, indeed, you must.\"\\n\\nanne was still in the lane; and though instinctively beginning to decline,\\nshe was not allowed to proceed.  the admiral\\'s kind urgency\\ncame in support of his wife\\'s; they would not be refused;\\nthey compressed themselves into the smallest possible space\\nto leave her a corner, and captain wentworth, without saying a word,\\nturned to her, and quietly obliged her to be assisted into the carriage.\\n\\nyes; he had done it.  she was in the carriage, and felt that he had\\nplaced her there, that his will and his hands had done it,\\nthat she owed it to his perception of her fatigue, and his resolution\\nto give her rest.  she was very much affected by the view of\\nhis disposition towards her, which all these things made apparent.\\nthis little circumstance seemed the completion of all that had gone before.\\nshe understood him.  he could not forgive her, but he could not\\nbe unfeeling.  though condemning her for the past, and considering it\\nwith high and unjust resentment, though perfectly careless of her,\\nand though becoming attached to another, still he could not see her suffer,\\nwithout the desire of giving her relief.  it was a remainder\\nof former sentiment; it was an impulse of pure, though unacknowledged\\nfriendship; it was a proof of his own warm and amiable heart,\\nwhich she could not contemplate without emotions so compounded\\nof pleasure and pain, that she knew not which prevailed.\\n\\nher answers to the kindness and the remarks of her companions\\nwere at first unconsciously given.  they had travelled half their way\\nalong the rough lane, before she was quite awake to what they said.\\nshe then found them talking of \"frederick.\"\\n\\n\"he certainly means to have one or other of those two girls, sophy,\"\\nsaid the admiral; \"but there is no saying which.  he has been\\nrunning after them, too, long enough, one would think, to make up his mind.\\nay, this comes of the peace.  if it were war now, he would have\\nsettled it long ago.  we sailors, miss elliot, cannot afford to make\\nlong courtships in time of war.  how many days was it, my dear,\\nbetween the first time of my seeing you and our sitting down together\\nin our lodgings at north yarmouth?\"\\n\\n\"we had better not talk about it, my dear,\" replied mrs croft, pleasantly;\\n\"for if miss elliot were to hear how soon we came to an understanding,\\nshe would never be persuaded that we could be happy together.\\ni had known you by character, however, long before.\"\\n\\n\"well, and i had heard of you as a very pretty girl, and what were we\\nto wait for besides?  i do not like having such things so long in hand.\\ni wish frederick would spread a little more canvass, and bring us home\\none of these young ladies to kellynch.  then there would always\\nbe company for them.  and very nice young ladies they both are;\\ni hardly know one from the other.\"\\n\\n\"very good humoured, unaffected girls, indeed,\" said mrs croft,\\nin a tone of calmer praise, such as made anne suspect that\\nher keener powers might not consider either of them as quite worthy\\nof her brother; \"and a very respectable family.  one could not be\\nconnected with better people.  my dear admiral, that post!\\nwe shall certainly take that post.\"\\n\\nbut by coolly giving the reins a better direction herself they happily\\npassed the danger; and by once afterwards judiciously putting out\\nher hand they neither fell into a rut, nor ran foul of a dung-cart;\\nand anne, with some amusement at their style of driving,\\nwhich she imagined no bad representation of the general guidance\\nof their affairs, found herself safely deposited by them at the cottage.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 11\\n\\n\\nthe time now approached for lady russell\\'s return:  the day was even fixed;\\nand anne, being engaged to join her as soon as she was resettled,\\nwas looking forward to an early removal to kellynch, and beginning\\nto think how her own comfort was likely to be affected by it.\\n\\nit would place her in the same village with captain wentworth,\\nwithin half a mile of him; they would have to frequent the same church,\\nand there must be intercourse between the two families.\\nthis was against her; but on the other hand, he spent so much of his time\\nat uppercross, that in removing thence she might be considered rather\\nas leaving him behind, than as going towards him; and, upon the whole,\\nshe believed she must, on this interesting question, be the gainer,\\nalmost as certainly as in her change of domestic society,\\nin leaving poor mary for lady russell.\\n\\nshe wished it might be possible for her to avoid ever seeing\\ncaptain wentworth at the hall:  those rooms had witnessed\\nformer meetings which would be brought too painfully before her;\\nbut she was yet more anxious for the possibility of lady russell and\\ncaptain wentworth never meeting anywhere.  they did not like each other,\\nand no renewal of acquaintance now could do any good; and were lady russell\\nto see them together, she might think that he had too much self-possession,\\nand she too little.\\n\\nthese points formed her chief solicitude in anticipating\\nher removal from uppercross, where she felt she had been stationed\\nquite long enough.  her usefulness to little charles would always\\ngive some sweetness to the memory of her two months\\' visit there,\\nbut he was gaining strength apace, and she had nothing else to stay for.\\n\\nthe conclusion of her visit, however, was diversified in a way\\nwhich she had not at all imagined.  captain wentworth, after being unseen\\nand unheard of at uppercross for two whole days, appeared again among them\\nto justify himself by a relation of what had kept him away.\\n\\na letter from his friend, captain harville, having found him out at last,\\nhad brought intelligence of captain harville\\'s being settled\\nwith his family at lyme for the winter; of their being therefore,\\nquite unknowingly, within twenty miles of each other.  captain harville\\nhad never been in good health since a severe wound which he received\\ntwo years before, and captain wentworth\\'s anxiety to see him\\nhad determined him to go immediately to lyme.  he had been there\\nfor four-and-twenty hours.  his acquittal was complete,\\nhis friendship warmly honoured, a lively interest excited for his friend,\\nand his description of the fine country about lyme so feelingly attended to\\nby the party, that an earnest desire to see lyme themselves,\\nand a project for going thither was the consequence.\\n\\nthe young people were all wild to see lyme.  captain wentworth talked\\nof going there again himself, it was only seventeen miles from uppercross;\\nthough november, the weather was by no means bad; and, in short,\\nlouisa, who was the most eager of the eager, having formed\\nthe resolution to go, and besides the pleasure of doing as she liked,\\nbeing now armed with the idea of merit in maintaining her own way,\\nbore down all the wishes of her father and mother for putting it off\\ntill summer; and to lyme they were to go--charles, mary, anne, henrietta,\\nlouisa, and captain wentworth.\\n\\nthe first heedless scheme had been to go in the morning and return at night;\\nbut to this mr musgrove, for the sake of his horses, would not consent;\\nand when it came to be rationally considered, a day in\\nthe middle of november would not leave much time for seeing a new place,\\nafter deducting seven hours, as the nature of the country required,\\nfor going and returning.  they were, consequently, to stay the night there,\\nand not to be expected back till the next day\\'s dinner.  this was felt\\nto be a considerable amendment; and though they all met at the great house\\nat rather an early breakfast hour, and set off very punctually,\\nit was so much past noon before the two carriages, mr musgrove\\'s coach\\ncontaining the four ladies, and charles\\'s curricle, in which\\nhe drove captain wentworth, were descending the long hill into lyme,\\nand entering upon the still steeper street of the town itself,\\nthat it was very evident they would not have more than time\\nfor looking about them, before the light and warmth of the day were gone.\\n\\nafter securing accommodations, and ordering a dinner at one of the inns,\\nthe next thing to be done was unquestionably to walk directly\\ndown to the sea.  they were come too late in the year for any amusement\\nor variety which lyme, as a public place, might offer.  the rooms\\nwere shut up, the lodgers almost all gone, scarcely any family\\nbut of the residents left; and, as there is nothing to admire\\nin the buildings themselves, the remarkable situation of the town,\\nthe principal street almost hurrying into the water, the walk to the cobb,\\nskirting round the pleasant little bay, which, in the season,\\nis animated with bathing machines and company; the cobb itself,\\nits old wonders and new improvements, with the very beautiful\\nline of cliffs stretching out to the east of the town, are what\\nthe stranger\\'s eye will seek; and a very strange stranger it must be,\\nwho does not see charms in the immediate environs of lyme,\\nto make him wish to know it better.  the scenes in its neighbourhood,\\ncharmouth, with its high grounds and extensive sweeps of country,\\nand still more, its sweet, retired bay, backed by dark cliffs,\\nwhere fragments of low rock among the sands, make it the happiest spot\\nfor watching the flow of the tide, for sitting in unwearied contemplation;\\nthe woody varieties of the cheerful village of up lyme; and, above all,\\npinny, with its green chasms between romantic rocks, where\\nthe scattered forest trees and orchards of luxuriant growth,\\ndeclare that many a generation must have passed away since the first\\npartial falling of the cliff prepared the ground for such a state,\\nwhere a scene so wonderful and so lovely is exhibited, as may\\nmore than equal any of the resembling scenes of the far-famed\\nisle of wight:  these places must be visited, and visited again,\\nto make the worth of lyme understood.\\n\\nthe party from uppercross passing down by the now deserted\\nand melancholy looking rooms, and still descending, soon found themselves\\non the sea-shore; and lingering only, as all must linger and gaze\\non a first return to the sea, who ever deserved to look on it at all,\\nproceeded towards the cobb, equally their object in itself\\nand on captain wentworth\\'s account:  for in a small house,\\nnear the foot of an old pier of unknown date, were the harvilles settled.\\ncaptain wentworth turned in to call on his friend; the others walked on,\\nand he was to join them on the cobb.\\n\\nthey were by no means tired of wondering and admiring; and not even louisa\\nseemed to feel that they had parted with captain wentworth long,\\nwhen they saw him coming after them, with three companions,\\nall well known already, by description, to be captain and mrs harville,\\nand a captain benwick, who was staying with them.\\n\\ncaptain benwick had some time ago been first lieutenant of the laconia;\\nand the account which captain wentworth had given of him,\\non his return from lyme before, his warm praise of him as\\nan excellent young man and an officer, whom he had always valued highly,\\nwhich must have stamped him well in the esteem of every listener,\\nhad been followed by a little history of his private life,\\nwhich rendered him perfectly interesting in the eyes of all the ladies.\\nhe had been engaged to captain harville\\'s sister, and was now\\nmourning her loss.  they had been a year or two waiting for fortune\\nand promotion.  fortune came, his prize-money as lieutenant being great;\\npromotion, too, came at last; but fanny harville did not live to know it.\\nshe had died the preceding summer while he was at sea.  captain wentworth\\nbelieved it impossible for man to be more attached to woman\\nthan poor benwick had been to fanny harville, or to be more deeply\\nafflicted under the dreadful change.  he considered his disposition\\nas of the sort which must suffer heavily, uniting very strong feelings\\nwith quiet, serious, and retiring manners, and a decided taste for reading,\\nand sedentary pursuits.  to finish the interest of the story,\\nthe friendship between him and the harvilles seemed, if possible,\\naugmented by the event which closed all their views of alliance,\\nand captain benwick was now living with them entirely.  captain harville\\nhad taken his present house for half a year; his taste, and his health,\\nand his fortune, all directing him to a residence inexpensive,\\nand by the sea; and the grandeur of the country, and the retirement\\nof lyme in the winter, appeared exactly adapted to captain benwick\\'s\\nstate of mind.  the sympathy and good-will excited towards captain benwick\\nwas very great.\\n\\n\"and yet,\" said anne to herself, as they now moved forward\\nto meet the party, \"he has not, perhaps, a more sorrowing heart\\nthan i have.  i cannot believe his prospects so blighted for ever.\\nhe is younger than i am; younger in feeling, if not in fact;\\nyounger as a man.  he will rally again, and be happy with another.\"\\n\\nthey all met, and were introduced.  captain harville was a tall,\\ndark man, with a sensible, benevolent countenance; a little lame;\\nand from strong features and want of health, looking much older\\nthan captain wentworth.  captain benwick looked, and was,\\nthe youngest of the three, and, compared with either of them,\\na little man.  he had a pleasing face and a melancholy air,\\njust as he ought to have, and drew back from conversation.\\n\\ncaptain harville, though not equalling captain wentworth in manners,\\nwas a perfect gentleman, unaffected, warm, and obliging.\\nmrs harville, a degree less polished than her husband, seemed, however,\\nto have the same good feelings; and nothing could be more pleasant\\nthan their desire of considering the whole party as friends of their own,\\nbecause the friends of captain wentworth, or more kindly hospitable\\nthan their entreaties for their all promising to dine with them.\\nthe dinner, already ordered at the inn, was at last, though unwillingly,\\naccepted as a excuse; but they seemed almost hurt that captain wentworth\\nshould have brought any such party to lyme, without considering it\\nas a thing of course that they should dine with them.\\n\\nthere was so much attachment to captain wentworth in all this,\\nand such a bewitching charm in a degree of hospitality so uncommon,\\nso unlike the usual style of give-and-take invitations, and dinners\\nof formality and display, that anne felt her spirits not likely to be\\nbenefited by an increasing acquaintance among his brother-officers.\\n\"these would have been all my friends,\" was her thought;\\nand she had to struggle against a great tendency to lowness.\\n\\non quitting the cobb, they all went in-doors with their new friends,\\nand found rooms so small as none but those who invite from the heart\\ncould think capable of accommodating so many.  anne had\\na moment\\'s astonishment on the subject herself; but it was soon lost\\nin the pleasanter feelings which sprang from the sight of all\\nthe ingenious contrivances and nice arrangements of captain harville,\\nto turn the actual space to the best account, to supply the deficiencies\\nof lodging-house furniture, and defend the windows and doors\\nagainst the winter storms to be expected.  the varieties in\\nthe fitting-up of the rooms, where the common necessaries\\nprovided by the owner, in the common indifferent plight,\\nwere contrasted with some few articles of a rare species of wood,\\nexcellently worked up, and with something curious and valuable\\nfrom all the distant countries captain harville had visited,\\nwere more than amusing to anne; connected as it all was with his profession,\\nthe fruit of its labours, the effect of its influence on his habits,\\nthe picture of repose and domestic happiness it presented,\\nmade it to her a something more, or less, than gratification.\\n\\ncaptain harville was no reader; but he had contrived\\nexcellent accommodations, and fashioned very pretty shelves,\\nfor a tolerable collection of well-bound volumes, the property of\\ncaptain benwick.  his lameness prevented him from taking much exercise;\\nbut a mind of usefulness and ingenuity seemed to furnish him with\\nconstant employment within.  he drew, he varnished, he carpentered,\\nhe glued; he made toys for the children; he fashioned new netting-needles\\nand pins with improvements; and if everything else was done,\\nsat down to his large fishing-net at one corner of the room.\\n\\nanne thought she left great happiness behind her when they\\nquitted the house; and louisa, by whom she found herself walking,\\nburst forth into raptures of admiration and delight on the character\\nof the navy; their friendliness, their brotherliness, their openness,\\ntheir uprightness; protesting that she was convinced of sailors having\\nmore worth and warmth than any other set of men in england;\\nthat they only knew how to live, and they only deserved to be\\nrespected and loved.\\n\\nthey went back to dress and dine; and so well had the scheme\\nanswered already, that nothing was found amiss; though its being\\n\"so entirely out of season,\" and the \"no thoroughfare of lyme,\"\\nand the \"no expectation of company,\" had brought many apologies\\nfrom the heads of the inn.\\n\\nanne found herself by this time growing so much more hardened\\nto being in captain wentworth\\'s company than she had at first imagined\\ncould ever be, that the sitting down to the same table with him now,\\nand the interchange of the common civilities attending on it\\n(they never got beyond), was become a mere nothing.\\n\\nthe nights were too dark for the ladies to meet again till the morrow,\\nbut captain harville had promised them a visit in the evening;\\nand he came, bringing his friend also, which was more than\\nhad been expected, it having been agreed that captain benwick\\nhad all the appearance of being oppressed by the presence of\\nso many strangers.  he ventured among them again, however,\\nthough his spirits certainly did not seem fit for the mirth\\nof the party in general.\\n\\nwhile captains wentworth and harville led the talk on one side of the room,\\nand by recurring to former days, supplied anecdotes in abundance\\nto occupy and entertain the others, it fell to anne\\'s lot to be placed\\nrather apart with captain benwick; and a very good impulse\\nof her nature obliged her to begin an acquaintance with him.\\nhe was shy, and disposed to abstraction; but the engaging mildness of\\nher countenance, and gentleness of her manners, soon had their effect;\\nand anne was well repaid the first trouble of exertion.\\nhe was evidently a young man of considerable taste in reading,\\nthough principally in poetry; and besides the persuasion of having\\ngiven him at least an evening\\'s indulgence in the discussion of subjects,\\nwhich his usual companions had probably no concern in, she had the hope\\nof being of real use to him in some suggestions as to the duty and\\nbenefit of struggling against affliction, which had naturally grown out\\nof their conversation.  for, though shy, he did not seem reserved;\\nit had rather the appearance of feelings glad to burst their\\nusual restraints; and having talked of poetry, the richness of\\nthe present age, and gone through a brief comparison of opinion\\nas to the first-rate poets, trying to ascertain whether marmion\\nor the lady of the lake were to be preferred, and how ranked the giaour\\nand the bride of abydos; and moreover, how the giaour was to be pronounced,\\nhe showed himself so intimately acquainted with all the tenderest songs\\nof the one poet, and all the impassioned descriptions of hopeless agony\\nof the other; he repeated, with such tremulous feeling, the various lines\\nwhich imaged a broken heart, or a mind destroyed by wretchedness,\\nand looked so entirely as if he meant to be understood,\\nthat she ventured to hope he did not always read only poetry,\\nand to say, that she thought it was the misfortune of poetry to be\\nseldom safely enjoyed by those who enjoyed it completely;\\nand that the strong feelings which alone could estimate it truly\\nwere the very feelings which ought to taste it but sparingly.\\n\\nhis looks shewing him not pained, but pleased with this allusion\\nto his situation, she was emboldened to go on; and feeling in herself\\nthe right of seniority of mind, she ventured to recommend\\na larger allowance of prose in his daily study; and on being requested\\nto particularize, mentioned such works of our best moralists,\\nsuch collections of the finest letters, such memoirs of characters\\nof worth and suffering, as occurred to her at the moment\\nas calculated to rouse and fortify the mind by the highest precepts,\\nand the strongest examples of moral and religious endurances.\\n\\ncaptain benwick listened attentively, and seemed grateful for\\nthe interest implied; and though with a shake of the head,\\nand sighs which declared his little faith in the efficacy of any books\\non grief like his, noted down the names of those she recommended,\\nand promised to procure and read them.\\n\\nwhen the evening was over, anne could not but be amused at the idea\\nof her coming to lyme to preach patience and resignation to a young man\\nwhom she had never seen before; nor could she help fearing,\\non more serious reflection, that, like many other great moralists\\nand preachers, she had been eloquent on a point in which her own conduct\\nwould ill bear examination.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 12\\n\\n\\nanne and henrietta, finding themselves the earliest of the party\\nthe next morning, agreed to stroll down to the sea before breakfast.\\nthey went to the sands, to watch the flowing of the tide,\\nwhich a fine south-easterly breeze was bringing in with all the grandeur\\nwhich so flat a shore admitted.  they praised the morning;\\ngloried in the sea; sympathized in the delight of the fresh-feeling\\nbreeze--and were silent; till henrietta suddenly began again with--\\n\\n\"oh! yes,--i am quite convinced that, with very few exceptions,\\nthe sea-air always does good.  there can be no doubt of its having been\\nof the greatest service to dr shirley, after his illness,\\nlast spring twelve-month.  he declares himself, that coming to lyme\\nfor a month, did him more good than all the medicine he took;\\nand, that being by the sea, always makes him feel young again.\\nnow, i cannot help thinking it a pity that he does not live\\nentirely by the sea.  i do think he had better leave uppercross entirely,\\nand fix at lyme.  do not you, anne?  do not you agree with me,\\nthat it is the best thing he could do, both for himself and mrs shirley?\\nshe has cousins here, you know, and many acquaintance, which would\\nmake it cheerful for her, and i am sure she would be glad\\nto get to a place where she could have medical attendance at hand,\\nin case of his having another seizure.  indeed i think it quite melancholy\\nto have such excellent people as dr and mrs shirley, who have been\\ndoing good all their lives, wearing out their last days in a place\\nlike uppercross, where, excepting our family, they seem shut out\\nfrom all the world.  i wish his friends would propose it to him.\\ni really think they ought.  and, as to procuring a dispensation,\\nthere could be no difficulty at his time of life, and with his character.\\nmy only doubt is, whether anything could persuade him to leave his parish.\\nhe is so very strict and scrupulous in his notions; over-scrupulous\\ni must say.  do not you think, anne, it is being over-scrupulous?\\ndo not you think it is quite a mistaken point of conscience,\\nwhen a clergyman sacrifices his health for the sake of duties,\\nwhich may be just as well performed by another person?  and at lyme too,\\nonly seventeen miles off, he would be near enough to hear,\\nif people thought there was anything to complain of.\"\\n\\nanne smiled more than once to herself during this speech,\\nand entered into the subject, as ready to do good by entering into\\nthe feelings of a young lady as of a young man, though here it was good\\nof a lower standard, for what could be offered but general acquiescence?\\nshe said all that was reasonable and proper on the business;\\nfelt the claims of dr shirley to repose as she ought; saw how very\\ndesirable it was that he should have some active, respectable young man,\\nas a resident curate, and was even courteous enough to hint at\\nthe advantage of such resident curate\\'s being married.\\n\\n\"i wish,\" said henrietta, very well pleased with her companion,\\n\"i wish lady russell lived at uppercross, and were intimate\\nwith dr shirley.  i have always heard of lady russell as a woman of\\nthe greatest influence with everybody!  i always look upon her as able\\nto persuade a person to anything!  i am afraid of her, as i have\\ntold you before, quite afraid of her, because she is so very clever;\\nbut i respect her amazingly, and wish we had such a neighbour\\nat uppercross.\"\\n\\nanne was amused by henrietta\\'s manner of being grateful,\\nand amused also that the course of events and the new interests\\nof henrietta\\'s views should have placed her friend at all in favour\\nwith any of the musgrove family; she had only time, however,\\nfor a general answer, and a wish that such another woman\\nwere at uppercross, before all subjects suddenly ceased,\\non seeing louisa and captain wentworth coming towards them.\\nthey came also for a stroll till breakfast was likely to be ready;\\nbut louisa recollecting, immediately afterwards that she had something\\nto procure at a shop, invited them all to go back with her into the town.\\nthey were all at her disposal.\\n\\nwhen they came to the steps, leading upwards from the beach, a gentleman,\\nat the same moment preparing to come down, politely drew back,\\nand stopped to give them way.  they ascended and passed him;\\nand as they passed, anne\\'s face caught his eye, and he looked at her\\nwith a degree of earnest admiration, which she could not be insensible of.\\nshe was looking remarkably well; her very regular, very pretty features,\\nhaving the bloom and freshness of youth restored by the fine wind\\nwhich had been blowing on her complexion, and by the animation of eye\\nwhich it had also produced.  it was evident that the gentleman,\\n(completely a gentleman in manner) admired her exceedingly.\\ncaptain wentworth looked round at her instantly in a way which\\nshewed his noticing of it.  he gave her a momentary glance,\\na glance of brightness, which seemed to say, \"that man is struck with you,\\nand even i, at this moment, see something like anne elliot again.\"\\n\\nafter attending louisa through her business, and loitering about\\na little longer, they returned to the inn; and anne, in passing afterwards\\nquickly from her own chamber to their dining-room, had nearly run against\\nthe very same gentleman, as he came out of an adjoining apartment.\\nshe had before conjectured him to be a stranger like themselves,\\nand determined that a well-looking groom, who was strolling about\\nnear the two inns as they came back, should be his servant.\\nboth master and man being in mourning assisted the idea.\\nit was now proved that he belonged to the same inn as themselves;\\nand this second meeting, short as it was, also proved again\\nby the gentleman\\'s looks, that he thought hers very lovely,\\nand by the readiness and propriety of his apologies, that he was\\na man of exceedingly good manners.  he seemed about thirty,\\nand though not handsome, had an agreeable person.  anne felt that\\nshe should like to know who he was.\\n\\nthey had nearly done breakfast, when the sound of a carriage,\\n(almost the first they had heard since entering lyme) drew half the party\\nto the window.  it was a gentleman\\'s carriage, a curricle,\\nbut only coming round from the stable-yard to the front door;\\nsomebody must be going away.  it was driven by a servant in mourning.\\n\\nthe word curricle made charles musgrove jump up that he might\\ncompare it with his own; the servant in mourning roused anne\\'s curiosity,\\nand the whole six were collected to look, by the time the owner\\nof the curricle was to be seen issuing from the door amidst the bows\\nand civilities of the household, and taking his seat, to drive off.\\n\\n\"ah!\" cried captain wentworth, instantly, and with half a glance at anne,\\n\"it is the very man we passed.\"\\n\\nthe miss musgroves agreed to it; and having all kindly watched him\\nas far up the hill as they could, they returned to the breakfast table.\\nthe waiter came into the room soon afterwards.\\n\\n\"pray,\" said captain wentworth, immediately, \"can you tell us the name\\nof the gentleman who is just gone away?\"\\n\\n\"yes, sir, a mr elliot, a gentleman of large fortune, came in last night\\nfrom sidmouth.  dare say you heard the carriage, sir, while you were\\nat dinner; and going on now for crewkherne, in his way to bath\\nand london.\"\\n\\n\"elliot!\"  many had looked on each other, and many had repeated the name,\\nbefore all this had been got through, even by the smart rapidity\\nof a waiter.\\n\\n\"bless me!\" cried mary; \"it must be our cousin; it must be our mr elliot,\\nit must, indeed!  charles, anne, must not it?  in mourning, you see,\\njust as our mr elliot must be.  how very extraordinary!\\nin the very same inn with us!  anne, must not it be our mr elliot?\\nmy father\\'s next heir?  pray sir,\" turning to the waiter,\\n\"did not you hear, did not his servant say whether he belonged\\nto the kellynch family?\"\\n\\n\"no, ma\\'am, he did not mention no particular family; but he said\\nhis master was a very rich gentleman, and would be a baronight some day.\"\\n\\n\"there! you see!\" cried mary in an ecstasy, \"just as i said!\\nheir to sir walter elliot!  i was sure that would come out,\\nif it was so.  depend upon it, that is a circumstance which his servants\\ntake care to publish, wherever he goes.  but, anne, only conceive\\nhow extraordinary!  i wish i had looked at him more.  i wish we had\\nbeen aware in time, who it was, that he might have been introduced to us.\\nwhat a pity that we should not have been introduced to each other!\\ndo you think he had the elliot countenance?  i hardly looked at him,\\ni was looking at the horses; but i think he had something\\nof the elliot countenance, i wonder the arms did not strike me!\\noh! the great-coat was hanging over the panel, and hid the arms,\\nso it did; otherwise, i am sure, i should have observed them,\\nand the livery too; if the servant had not been in mourning,\\none should have known him by the livery.\"\\n\\n\"putting all these very extraordinary circumstances together,\"\\nsaid captain wentworth, \"we must consider it to be the arrangement\\nof providence, that you should not be introduced to your cousin.\"\\n\\nwhen she could command mary\\'s attention, anne quietly tried\\nto convince her that their father and mr elliot had not, for many years,\\nbeen on such terms as to make the power of attempting an introduction\\nat all desirable.\\n\\nat the same time, however, it was a secret gratification to herself\\nto have seen her cousin, and to know that the future owner of kellynch\\nwas undoubtedly a gentleman, and had an air of good sense.\\nshe would not, upon any account, mention her having met with him\\nthe second time; luckily mary did not much attend to their having\\npassed close by him in their earlier walk, but she would have felt\\nquite ill-used by anne\\'s having actually run against him in the passage,\\nand received his very polite excuses, while she had never been\\nnear him at all; no, that cousinly little interview must remain\\na perfect secret.\\n\\n\"of course,\" said mary, \"you will mention our seeing mr elliot,\\nthe next time you write to bath.  i think my father certainly\\nought to hear of it; do mention all about him.\"\\n\\nanne avoided a direct reply, but it was just the circumstance\\nwhich she considered as not merely unnecessary to be communicated,\\nbut as what ought to be suppressed.  the offence which had been given\\nher father, many years back, she knew; elizabeth\\'s particular share in it\\nshe suspected; and that mr elliot\\'s idea always produced irritation in both\\nwas beyond a doubt.  mary never wrote to bath herself; all the toil\\nof keeping up a slow and unsatisfactory correspondence with elizabeth\\nfell on anne.\\n\\nbreakfast had not been long over, when they were joined by captain\\nand mrs harville and captain benwick; with whom they had appointed\\nto take their last walk about lyme.  they ought to be setting off\\nfor uppercross by one, and in the mean while were to be all together,\\nand out of doors as long as they could.\\n\\nanne found captain benwick getting near her, as soon as they were all\\nfairly in the street.  their conversation the preceding evening\\ndid not disincline him to seek her again; and they walked together\\nsome time, talking as before of mr scott and lord byron,\\nand still as unable as before, and as unable as any other two readers,\\nto think exactly alike of the merits of either, till something\\noccasioned an almost general change amongst their party, and instead of\\ncaptain benwick, she had captain harville by her side.\\n\\n\"miss elliot,\" said he, speaking rather low, \"you have done a good deed\\nin making that poor fellow talk so much.  i wish he could have\\nsuch company oftener.  it is bad for him, i know, to be shut up as he is;\\nbut what can we do?  we cannot part.\"\\n\\n\"no,\" said anne, \"that i can easily believe to be impossible;\\nbut in time, perhaps--we know what time does in every case of affliction,\\nand you must remember, captain harville, that your friend\\nmay yet be called a young mourner--only last summer, i understand.\"\\n\\n\"ay, true enough,\" (with a deep sigh) \"only june.\"\\n\\n\"and not known to him, perhaps, so soon.\"\\n\\n\"not till the first week of august, when he came home from the cape,\\njust made into the grappler.  i was at plymouth dreading to hear of him;\\nhe sent in letters, but the grappler was under orders for portsmouth.\\nthere the news must follow him, but who was to tell it? not i.\\ni would as soon have been run up to the yard-arm.  nobody could do it,\\nbut that good fellow\" (pointing to captain wentworth.)  \"the laconia\\nhad come into plymouth the week before; no danger of her\\nbeing sent to sea again.  he stood his chance for the rest;\\nwrote up for leave of absence, but without waiting the return,\\ntravelled night and day till he got to portsmouth, rowed off\\nto the grappler that instant, and never left the poor fellow for a week.\\nthat\\'s what he did, and nobody else could have saved poor james.\\nyou may think, miss elliot, whether he is dear to us!\"\\n\\nanne did think on the question with perfect decision, and said as much\\nin reply as her own feeling could accomplish, or as his seemed\\nable to bear, for he was too much affected to renew the subject,\\nand when he spoke again, it was of something totally different.\\n\\nmrs harville\\'s giving it as her opinion that her husband would have\\nquite walking enough by the time he reached home, determined the direction\\nof all the party in what was to be their last walk; they would\\naccompany them to their door, and then return and set off themselves.\\nby all their calculations there was just time for this; but as they drew\\nnear the cobb, there was such a general wish to walk along it once more,\\nall were so inclined, and louisa soon grew so determined,\\nthat the difference of a quarter of an hour, it was found,\\nwould be no difference at all; so with all the kind leave-taking,\\nand all the kind interchange of invitations and promises which\\nmay be imagined, they parted from captain and mrs harville\\nat their own door, and still accompanied by captain benwick,\\nwho seemed to cling to them to the last, proceeded to make\\nthe proper adieus to the cobb.\\n\\nanne found captain benwick again drawing near her.  lord byron\\'s\\n\"dark blue seas\" could not fail of being brought forward by\\ntheir present view, and she gladly gave him all her attention as long as\\nattention was possible.  it was soon drawn, perforce another way.\\n\\nthere was too much wind to make the high part of the new cobb pleasant\\nfor the ladies, and they agreed to get down the steps to the lower,\\nand all were contented to pass quietly and carefully down the steep flight,\\nexcepting louisa; she must be jumped down them by captain wentworth.\\nin all their walks, he had had to jump her from the stiles;\\nthe sensation was delightful to her.  the hardness of the pavement\\nfor her feet, made him less willing upon the present occasion;\\nhe did it, however.  she was safely down, and instantly,\\nto show her enjoyment, ran up the steps to be jumped down again.\\nhe advised her against it, thought the jar too great; but no,\\nhe reasoned and talked in vain, she smiled and said, \"i am determined\\ni will:\" he put out his hands; she was too precipitate by half a second,\\nshe fell on the pavement on the lower cobb, and was taken up lifeless!\\nthere was no wound, no blood, no visible bruise; but her eyes were closed,\\nshe breathed not, her face was like death.  the horror of the moment\\nto all who stood around!\\n\\ncaptain wentworth, who had caught her up, knelt with her in his arms,\\nlooking on her with a face as pallid as her own, in an agony of silence.\\n\"she is dead! she is dead!\" screamed mary, catching hold of her\\nhusband, and contributing with his own horror to make him immoveable;\\nand in another moment, henrietta, sinking under the conviction, lost\\nher senses too, and would have fallen on the steps, but for captain\\nbenwick and anne, who caught and supported her between them.\\n\\n\"is there no one to help me?\" were the first words which\\nburst from captain wentworth, in a tone of despair, and as if\\nall his own strength were gone.\\n\\n\"go to him, go to him,\" cried anne, \"for heaven\\'s sake go to him.\\ni can support her myself.  leave me, and go to him.  rub her hands,\\nrub her temples; here are salts; take them, take them.\"\\n\\ncaptain benwick obeyed, and charles at the same moment,\\ndisengaging himself from his wife, they were both with him;\\nand louisa was raised up and supported more firmly between them,\\nand everything was done that anne had prompted, but in vain;\\nwhile captain wentworth, staggering against the wall for his support,\\nexclaimed in the bitterest agony--\\n\\n\"oh god! her father and mother!\"\\n\\n\"a surgeon!\" said anne.\\n\\nhe caught the word; it seemed to rouse him at once, and saying only--\\n\"true, true, a surgeon this instant,\" was darting away,\\nwhen anne eagerly suggested--\\n\\n\"captain benwick, would not it be better for captain benwick?\\nhe knows where a surgeon is to be found.\"\\n\\nevery one capable of thinking felt the advantage of the idea,\\nand in a moment (it was all done in rapid moments) captain benwick had\\nresigned the poor corpse-like  figure entirely to the brother\\'s care,\\nand was off for the town with the utmost rapidity.\\n\\nas to the wretched party left behind, it could scarcely be said\\nwhich of the three, who were completely rational, was suffering most:\\ncaptain wentworth, anne, or charles, who, really a very affectionate\\nbrother, hung over louisa with sobs of grief, and could only turn his eyes\\nfrom one sister, to see the other in a state as insensible,\\nor to witness the hysterical agitations of his wife, calling on him\\nfor help which he could not give.\\n\\nanne, attending with all the strength and zeal, and thought,\\nwhich instinct supplied, to henrietta, still tried, at intervals,\\nto suggest comfort to the others, tried to quiet mary, to animate charles,\\nto assuage the feelings of captain wentworth.  both seemed to look to her\\nfor directions.\\n\\n\"anne, anne,\" cried charles, \"what is to be done next?\\nwhat, in heaven\\'s name, is to be done next?\"\\n\\ncaptain wentworth\\'s eyes were also turned towards her.\\n\\n\"had not she better be carried to the inn?  yes, i am sure:\\ncarry her gently to the inn.\"\\n\\n\"yes, yes, to the inn,\" repeated captain wentworth, comparatively\\ncollected, and eager to be doing something.  \"i will carry her myself.\\nmusgrove, take care of the others.\"\\n\\nby this time the report of the accident had spread among the workmen\\nand boatmen about the cobb, and many were collected near them,\\nto be useful if wanted, at any rate, to enjoy the sight of\\na dead young lady, nay, two dead young ladies, for it proved twice as fine\\nas the first report.  to some of the best-looking of these good people\\nhenrietta was consigned, for, though partially revived,\\nshe was quite helpless; and in this manner, anne walking by her side,\\nand charles attending to his wife, they set forward, treading back\\nwith feelings unutterable, the ground, which so lately, so very lately,\\nand so light of heart, they had passed along.\\n\\nthey were not off the cobb, before the harvilles met them.\\ncaptain benwick had been seen flying by their house, with a countenance\\nwhich showed something to be wrong; and they had set off immediately,\\ninformed and directed as they passed, towards the spot.\\nshocked as captain harville was, he brought senses and nerves\\nthat could be instantly useful; and a look between him and his wife\\ndecided what was to be done.  she must be taken to their house;\\nall must go to their house; and await the surgeon\\'s arrival there.\\nthey would not listen to scruples:  he was obeyed; they were all\\nbeneath his roof; and while louisa, under mrs harville\\'s direction,\\nwas conveyed up stairs, and given possession of her own bed,\\nassistance, cordials, restoratives were supplied by her husband\\nto all who needed them.\\n\\nlouisa had once opened her eyes, but soon closed them again,\\nwithout apparent consciousness.  this had been a proof of life,\\nhowever, of service to her sister; and henrietta, though perfectly\\nincapable of being in the same room with louisa, was kept,\\nby the agitation of hope and fear, from a return of her own insensibility.\\nmary, too, was growing calmer.\\n\\nthe surgeon was with them almost before it had seemed possible.\\nthey were sick with horror, while he examined; but he was not hopeless.\\nthe head had received a severe contusion, but he had seen greater injuries\\nrecovered from:  he was by no means hopeless; he spoke cheerfully.\\n\\nthat he did not regard it as a desperate case, that he did not say\\na few hours must end it, was at first felt, beyond the hope of most;\\nand the ecstasy of such a reprieve, the rejoicing, deep and silent,\\nafter a few fervent ejaculations of gratitude to heaven had been offered,\\nmay be conceived.\\n\\nthe tone, the look, with which \"thank god!\" was uttered\\nby captain wentworth, anne was sure could never be forgotten by her;\\nnor the sight of him afterwards, as he sat near a table, leaning over it\\nwith folded arms and face concealed, as if overpowered by\\nthe various feelings of his soul, and trying by prayer and reflection\\nto calm them.\\n\\nlouisa\\'s limbs had escaped.  there was no injury but to the head.\\n\\nit now became necessary for the party to consider what was best to be done,\\nas to their general situation.  they were now able to speak to each other\\nand consult.  that louisa must remain where she was, however distressing\\nto her friends to be involving the harvilles in such trouble,\\ndid not admit a doubt.  her removal was impossible.  the harvilles\\nsilenced all scruples; and, as much as they could, all gratitude.\\nthey had looked forward and arranged everything before the others\\nbegan to reflect.  captain benwick must give up his room to them,\\nand get another bed elsewhere; and the whole was settled.\\nthey were only concerned that the house could accommodate no more;\\nand yet perhaps, by \"putting the children away in the maid\\'s room,\\nor swinging a cot somewhere,\" they could hardly bear to think of not\\nfinding room for two or three besides, supposing they might wish to stay;\\nthough, with regard to any attendance on miss musgrove, there need not be\\nthe least uneasiness in leaving her to mrs harville\\'s care entirely.\\nmrs harville was a very experienced nurse, and her nursery-maid,\\nwho had lived with her long, and gone about with her everywhere,\\nwas just such another.  between these two, she could want\\nno possible attendance by day or night.  and all this was said\\nwith a truth and sincerity of feeling irresistible.\\n\\ncharles, henrietta, and captain wentworth were the three in consultation,\\nand for a little while it was only an interchange of perplexity and terror.\\n\"uppercross, the necessity of some one\\'s going to uppercross;\\nthe news to be conveyed; how it could be broken to mr and mrs musgrove;\\nthe lateness of the morning; an hour already gone since they\\nought to have been off; the impossibility of being in tolerable time.\"\\nat first, they were capable of nothing more to the purpose\\nthan such exclamations; but, after a while, captain wentworth,\\nexerting himself, said--\\n\\n\"we must be decided, and without the loss of another minute.\\nevery minute is valuable.  some one must resolve on being off\\nfor uppercross instantly.  musgrove, either you or i must go.\"\\n\\ncharles agreed, but declared his resolution of not going away.\\nhe would be as little incumbrance as possible to captain and mrs harville;\\nbut as to leaving his sister in such a state, he neither ought, nor would.\\nso far it was decided; and henrietta at first declared the same.\\nshe, however, was soon persuaded to think differently.  the usefulness\\nof her staying!  she who had not been able to remain in louisa\\'s room,\\nor to look at her, without sufferings which made her worse than helpless!\\nshe was forced to acknowledge that she could do no good,\\nyet was still unwilling to be away, till, touched by the thought\\nof her father and mother, she gave it up; she consented,\\nshe was anxious to be at home.\\n\\nthe plan had reached this point, when anne, coming quietly\\ndown from louisa\\'s room, could not but hear what followed,\\nfor the parlour door was open.\\n\\n\"then it is settled, musgrove,\" cried captain wentworth,\\n\"that you stay, and that i take care of your sister home.\\nbut as to the rest, as to the others, if one stays to assist mrs harville,\\ni think it need be only one.  mrs charles musgrove will, of course,\\nwish to get back to her children; but if anne will stay, no one so proper,\\nso capable as anne.\"\\n\\nshe paused a moment to recover from the emotion of hearing herself\\nso spoken of.  the other two warmly agreed with what he said,\\nand she then appeared.\\n\\n\"you will stay, i am sure; you will stay and nurse her;\" cried he,\\nturning to her and speaking with a glow, and yet a gentleness,\\nwhich seemed almost restoring the past.  she coloured deeply,\\nand he recollected himself and moved away.  she expressed herself\\nmost willing, ready, happy to remain.  \"it was what she had been\\nthinking of, and wishing to be allowed to do.  a bed on the floor\\nin louisa\\'s room would be sufficient for her, if mrs harville\\nwould but think so.\"\\n\\none thing more, and all seemed arranged.  though it was rather desirable\\nthat mr and mrs musgrove should be previously alarmed by some\\nshare of delay; yet the time required by the uppercross horses\\nto take them back, would be a dreadful extension of suspense;\\nand captain wentworth proposed, and charles musgrove agreed,\\nthat it would be much better for him to take a chaise from the inn,\\nand leave mr musgrove\\'s carriage and horses to be sent home\\nthe next morning early, when there would be the farther advantage\\nof sending an account of louisa\\'s night.\\n\\ncaptain wentworth now hurried off to get everything ready on his part,\\nand to be soon followed by the two ladies.  when the plan was\\nmade known to mary, however, there was an end of all peace in it.\\nshe was so wretched and so vehement, complained so much of injustice\\nin being expected to go away instead of anne; anne, who was\\nnothing to louisa, while she was her sister, and had the best right\\nto stay in henrietta\\'s stead!  why was not she to be as useful as anne?\\nand to go home without charles, too, without her husband!\\nno, it was too unkind.  and in short, she said more than her husband\\ncould long withstand, and as none of the others could oppose\\nwhen he gave way, there was no help for it; the change of mary for anne\\nwas inevitable.\\n\\nanne had never submitted more reluctantly to the jealous\\nand ill-judging claims of mary; but so it must be, and they set off\\nfor the town, charles taking care of his sister, and captain benwick\\nattending to her.  she gave a moment\\'s recollection, as they hurried along,\\nto the little circumstances which the same spots had witnessed\\nearlier in the morning.  there she had listened to henrietta\\'s schemes\\nfor dr shirley\\'s leaving uppercross; farther on, she had\\nfirst seen mr elliot; a moment seemed all that could now be given\\nto any one but louisa, or those who were wrapt up in her welfare.\\n\\ncaptain benwick was most considerately attentive to her; and,\\nunited as they all seemed by the distress of the day, she felt\\nan increasing degree of good-will towards him, and a pleasure even\\nin thinking that it might, perhaps, be the occasion of continuing\\ntheir acquaintance.\\n\\ncaptain wentworth was on the watch for them, and a chaise and four in waiting,\\nstationed for their convenience in the lowest part of the street;\\nbut his evident surprise and vexation at the substitution of one sister\\nfor the other, the change in his countenance, the astonishment,\\nthe expressions begun and suppressed, with which charles was listened to,\\nmade but a mortifying reception of anne; or must at least convince her\\nthat she was valued only as she could be useful to louisa.\\n\\nshe endeavoured to be composed, and to be just.  without emulating\\nthe feelings of an emma towards her henry, she would have\\nattended on louisa with a zeal above the common claims of regard,\\nfor his sake; and she hoped he would not long be so unjust\\nas to suppose she would shrink unnecessarily from the office of a friend.\\n\\nin the mean while she was in the carriage.  he had handed them both in,\\nand placed himself between them; and in this manner, under these\\ncircumstances, full of astonishment and emotion to anne, she quitted lyme.\\nhow the long stage would pass; how it was to affect their manners;\\nwhat was to be their sort of intercourse, she could not foresee.\\nit was all quite natural, however.  he was devoted to henrietta;\\nalways turning towards her; and when he spoke at all, always with the view\\nof supporting her hopes and raising her spirits.  in general,\\nhis voice and manner were studiously calm.  to spare henrietta\\nfrom agitation seemed the governing principle.  once only,\\nwhen she had been grieving over the last ill-judged, ill-fated\\nwalk to the cobb, bitterly lamenting that it ever had been thought of,\\nhe burst forth, as if wholly overcome--\\n\\n\"don\\'t talk of it, don\\'t talk of it,\" he cried.  \"oh god! that i had\\nnot given way to her at the fatal moment!  had i done as i ought!\\nbut so eager and so resolute! dear, sweet louisa!\"\\n\\nanne wondered whether it ever occurred to him now, to question the justness\\nof his own previous opinion as to the universal felicity and advantage\\nof firmness of character; and whether it might not strike him that,\\nlike all other qualities of the mind, it should have its proportions\\nand limits.  she thought it could scarcely escape him to feel\\nthat a persuadable temper might sometimes be as much in favour of happiness\\nas a very resolute character.\\n\\nthey got on fast.  anne was astonished to recognise the same hills\\nand the same objects so soon.  their actual speed, heightened by\\nsome dread of the conclusion, made the road appear but half as long\\nas on the day before.  it was growing quite dusk, however,\\nbefore they were in the neighbourhood of uppercross, and there had been\\ntotal silence among them for some time, henrietta leaning back\\nin the corner, with a shawl over her face, giving the hope of her\\nhaving cried herself to sleep; when, as they were going up their last hill,\\nanne found herself all at once addressed by captain wentworth.\\nin a low, cautious voice, he said: --\\n\\n\"i have been considering what we had best do.  she must not\\nappear at first.  she could not stand it.  i have been thinking whether\\nyou had not better remain in the carriage with her, while i go in\\nand break it to mr and mrs musgrove.  do you think this is a good plan?\"\\n\\nshe did:  he was satisfied, and said no more.  but the remembrance\\nof the appeal remained a pleasure to her, as a proof of friendship,\\nand of deference for her judgement, a great pleasure; and when it became\\na sort of parting proof, its value did not lessen.\\n\\nwhen the distressing communication at uppercross was over,\\nand he had seen the father and mother quite as composed as could be hoped,\\nand the daughter all the better for being with them, he announced\\nhis intention of returning in the same carriage to lyme;\\nand when the horses were baited, he was off.\\n\\n(end of volume one.)\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 13\\n\\n\\nthe remainder of anne\\'s time at uppercross, comprehending only two days,\\nwas spent entirely at the mansion house; and she had the satisfaction\\nof knowing herself extremely useful there, both as an immediate companion,\\nand as assisting in all those arrangements for the future, which,\\nin mr and mrs musgrove\\'s distressed state of spirits, would have\\nbeen difficulties.\\n\\nthey had an early account from lyme the next morning.  louisa was\\nmuch the same.  no symptoms worse than before had appeared.\\ncharles came a few hours afterwards, to bring a later and\\nmore particular account.  he was tolerably cheerful.  a speedy cure\\nmust not be hoped, but everything was going on as well\\nas the nature of the case admitted.  in speaking of the harvilles,\\nhe seemed unable to satisfy his own sense of their kindness,\\nespecially of mrs harville\\'s exertions as a nurse.  \"she really left\\nnothing for mary to do.  he and mary had been persuaded to go early\\nto their inn last night.  mary had been hysterical again this morning.\\nwhen he came away, she was going to walk out with captain benwick,\\nwhich, he hoped, would do her good.  he almost wished she had been\\nprevailed on to come home the day before; but the truth was,\\nthat mrs harville left nothing for anybody to do.\"\\n\\ncharles was to return to lyme the same afternoon, and his father\\nhad at first half a mind to go with him, but the ladies could not consent.\\nit would be going only to multiply trouble to the others,\\nand increase his own distress; and a much better scheme followed\\nand was acted upon.  a chaise was sent for from crewkherne,\\nand charles conveyed back a far more useful person in the old nursery-maid\\nof the family, one who having brought up all the children,\\nand seen the very last, the lingering and long-petted master harry,\\nsent to school after his brothers, was now living in her deserted nursery\\nto mend stockings and dress all the blains and bruises she could\\nget near her, and who, consequently, was only too happy in being\\nallowed to go and help nurse dear miss louisa.  vague wishes of\\ngetting sarah thither, had occurred before to mrs musgrove and henrietta;\\nbut without anne, it would hardly have been resolved on,\\nand found practicable so soon.\\n\\nthey were indebted, the next day, to charles hayter, for all\\nthe minute knowledge of louisa, which it was so essential to obtain\\nevery twenty-four hours.  he made it his business to go to lyme,\\nand his account was still encouraging.  the intervals of sense\\nand consciousness were believed to be stronger.  every report agreed\\nin captain wentworth\\'s appearing fixed in lyme.\\n\\nanne was to leave them on the morrow, an event which they all dreaded.\\n\"what should they do without her?  they were wretched comforters\\nfor one another.\"  and so much was said in this way, that anne thought\\nshe could not do better than impart among them the general inclination\\nto which she was privy, and persuaded them all to go to lyme at once.\\nshe had little difficulty; it was soon determined that they would go;\\ngo to-morrow, fix themselves at the inn, or get into lodgings,\\nas it suited, and there remain till dear louisa could be moved.\\nthey must be taking off some trouble from the good people she was with;\\nthey might at least relieve mrs harville from the care of her own children;\\nand in short, they were so happy in the decision, that anne was delighted\\nwith what she had done, and felt that she could not spend her\\nlast morning at uppercross better than in assisting their preparations,\\nand sending them off at an early hour, though her being left\\nto the solitary range of the house was the consequence.\\n\\nshe was the last, excepting the little boys at the cottage,\\nshe was the very last, the only remaining one of all that had filled\\nand animated both houses, of all that had given uppercross\\nits cheerful character.  a few days had made a change indeed!\\n\\nif louisa recovered, it would all be well again.  more than\\nformer happiness would be restored.  there could not be a doubt,\\nto her mind there was none, of what would follow her recovery.\\na few months hence, and the room now so deserted, occupied but by\\nher silent, pensive self, might be filled again with all that was happy\\nand gay, all that was glowing and bright in prosperous love,\\nall that was most unlike anne elliot!\\n\\nan hour\\'s complete leisure for such reflections as these,\\non a dark november day, a small thick rain almost blotting out\\nthe very few objects ever to be discerned from the windows, was enough\\nto make the sound of lady russell\\'s carriage exceedingly welcome;\\nand yet, though desirous to be gone, she could not quit the mansion house,\\nor look an adieu to the cottage, with its black, dripping and\\ncomfortless veranda, or even notice through the misty glasses\\nthe last humble tenements of the village, without a saddened heart.\\nscenes had passed in uppercross which made it precious.\\nit stood the record of many sensations of pain, once severe,\\nbut now softened; and of some instances of relenting feeling,\\nsome breathings of friendship and reconciliation, which could\\nnever be looked for again, and which could never cease to be dear.\\nshe left it all behind her, all but the recollection that\\nsuch things had been.\\n\\nanne had never entered kellynch since her quitting lady russell\\'s house\\nin september.  it had not been necessary, and the few occasions of\\nits being possible for her to go to the hall she had contrived to evade\\nand escape from.  her first return was to resume her place in the modern\\nand elegant apartments of the lodge, and to gladden the eyes\\nof its mistress.\\n\\nthere was some anxiety mixed with lady russell\\'s joy in meeting her.\\nshe knew who had been frequenting uppercross.  but happily,\\neither anne was improved in plumpness and looks, or lady russell\\nfancied her so; and anne, in receiving her compliments on the occasion,\\nhad the amusement of connecting them with the silent admiration\\nof her cousin, and of hoping that she was to be blessed with\\na second spring of youth and beauty.\\n\\nwhen they came to converse, she was soon sensible of some mental change.\\nthe subjects of which her heart had been full on leaving kellynch,\\nand which she had felt slighted, and been compelled to smother\\namong the musgroves, were now become but of secondary interest.\\nshe had lately lost sight even of her father and sister and bath.\\ntheir concerns had been sunk under those of uppercross;\\nand when lady russell reverted to their former hopes and fears,\\nand spoke her satisfaction in the house in camden place,\\nwhich had been taken, and her regret that mrs clay should still\\nbe with them, anne would have been ashamed to have it known\\nhow much more she was thinking of lyme and louisa musgrove,\\nand all her acquaintance there; how much more interesting to her\\nwas the home and the friendship of the harvilles and captain benwick,\\nthan her own father\\'s house in camden place, or her own sister\\'s intimacy\\nwith mrs clay.  she was actually forced to exert herself\\nto meet lady russell with anything like the appearance of equal solicitude,\\non topics which had by nature the first claim on her.\\n\\nthere was a little awkwardness at first in their discourse\\non another subject.  they must speak of the accident at lyme.\\nlady russell had not been arrived five minutes the day before,\\nwhen a full account of the whole had burst on her; but still it must\\nbe talked of, she must make enquiries, she must regret the imprudence,\\nlament the result, and captain wentworth\\'s name must be mentioned by both.\\nanne was conscious of not doing it so well as lady russell.\\nshe could not speak the name, and look straight forward to\\nlady russell\\'s eye, till she had adopted the expedient of telling her\\nbriefly what she thought of the attachment between him and louisa.\\nwhen this was told, his name distressed her no longer.\\n\\nlady russell had only to listen composedly, and wish them happy,\\nbut internally her heart revelled in angry pleasure, in pleased contempt,\\nthat the man who at twenty-three had seemed to understand somewhat\\nof the value of an anne elliot, should, eight years afterwards,\\nbe charmed by a louisa musgrove.\\n\\nthe first three or four days passed most quietly, with no circumstance\\nto mark them excepting the receipt of a note or two from lyme,\\nwhich found their way to anne, she could not tell how, and brought\\na rather improving account of louisa.  at the end of that period,\\nlady russell\\'s politeness could repose no longer, and the fainter\\nself-threatenings of the past became in a decided tone,\\n\"i must call on mrs croft; i really must call upon her soon.\\nanne, have you courage to go with me, and pay a visit in that house?\\nit will be some trial to us both.\"\\n\\nanne did not shrink from it; on the contrary, she truly felt as she said,\\nin observing--\\n\\n\"i think you are very likely to suffer the most of the two;\\nyour feelings are less reconciled to the change than mine.\\nby remaining in the neighbourhood, i am become inured to it.\"\\n\\nshe could have said more on the subject; for she had in fact\\nso high an opinion of the crofts, and considered her father\\nso very fortunate in his tenants, felt the parish to be so sure\\nof a good example, and the poor of the best attention and relief,\\nthat however sorry and ashamed for the necessity of the removal,\\nshe could not but in conscience feel that they were gone\\nwho deserved not to stay, and that kellynch hall had passed\\ninto better hands than its owners\\'.  these convictions must unquestionably\\nhave their own pain, and severe was its kind; but they precluded\\nthat pain which lady russell would suffer in entering the house again,\\nand returning through the well-known apartments.\\n\\nin such moments anne had no power of saying to herself,\\n\"these rooms ought to belong only to us.  oh, how fallen\\nin their destination!  how unworthily occupied!  an ancient family\\nto be so driven away!  strangers filling their place!\"\\nno, except when she thought of her mother, and remembered where\\nshe had been used to sit and preside, she had no sigh of that description\\nto heave.\\n\\nmrs croft always met her with a kindness which gave her the pleasure\\nof fancying herself a favourite, and on the present occasion,\\nreceiving her in that house, there was particular attention.\\n\\nthe sad accident at lyme was soon the prevailing topic,\\nand on comparing their latest accounts of the invalid, it appeared\\nthat each lady dated her intelligence from the same hour of yestermorn;\\nthat captain wentworth had been in kellynch yesterday (the first time\\nsince the accident), had brought anne the last note, which she had\\nnot been able to trace the exact steps of; had staid a few hours\\nand then returned again to lyme, and without any present intention\\nof quitting it any more.  he had enquired after her, she found,\\nparticularly; had expressed his hope of miss elliot\\'s not being\\nthe worse for her exertions, and had spoken of those exertions as great.\\nthis was handsome, and gave her more pleasure than almost anything else\\ncould have done.\\n\\nas to the sad catastrophe itself, it could be canvassed only in one style\\nby a couple of steady, sensible women, whose judgements had to work\\non ascertained events; and it was perfectly decided that it had been\\nthe consequence of much thoughtlessness and much imprudence;\\nthat its effects were most alarming, and that it was frightful to think,\\nhow long miss musgrove\\'s recovery might yet be doubtful, and how liable\\nshe would still remain to suffer from the concussion hereafter!\\nthe admiral wound it up summarily by exclaiming--\\n\\n\"ay, a very bad business indeed.  a new sort of way this,\\nfor a young fellow to be making love, by breaking his mistress\\'s head,\\nis not it, miss elliot?  this is breaking a head and giving a plaster,\\ntruly!\"\\n\\nadmiral croft\\'s manners were not quite of the tone to suit lady russell,\\nbut they delighted anne.  his goodness of heart and simplicity\\nof character were irresistible.\\n\\n\"now, this must be very bad for you,\" said he, suddenly rousing from\\na little reverie, \"to be coming and finding us here.  i had not\\nrecollected it before, i declare, but it must be very bad.\\nbut now, do not stand upon ceremony.  get up and go over all the rooms\\nin the house if you like it.\"\\n\\n\"another time, sir, i thank you, not now.\"\\n\\n\"well, whenever it suits you.  you can slip in from the shrubbery\\nat any time; and there you will find we keep our umbrellas hanging up\\nby that door.  a good place is not it?  but,\" (checking himself),\\n\"you will not think it a good place, for yours were always kept\\nin the butler\\'s room.  ay, so it always is, i believe.\\none man\\'s ways may be as good as another\\'s, but we all like our own best.\\nand so you must judge for yourself, whether it would be better for you\\nto go about the house or not.\"\\n\\nanne, finding she might decline it, did so, very gratefully.\\n\\n\"we have made very few changes either,\" continued the admiral,\\nafter thinking a moment.  \"very few.  we told you about the laundry-door,\\nat uppercross.  that has been a very great improvement.\\nthe wonder was, how any family upon earth could bear with the inconvenience\\nof its opening as it did, so long!  you will tell sir walter\\nwhat we have done, and that mr shepherd thinks it the greatest improvement\\nthe house ever had.  indeed, i must do ourselves the justice to say,\\nthat the few alterations we have made have been all very much\\nfor the better.  my wife should have the credit of them, however.\\ni have done very little besides sending away some of the large\\nlooking-glasses from my dressing-room, which was your father\\'s.\\na very good man, and very much the gentleman i am sure:\\nbut i should think, miss elliot,\" (looking with serious reflection),\\n\"i should think he must be rather a dressy man for his time of life.\\nsuch a number of looking-glasses! oh lord! there was no getting away\\nfrom one\\'s self.  so i got sophy to lend me a hand, and we soon\\nshifted their quarters; and now i am quite snug, with my\\nlittle shaving glass in one corner, and another great thing\\nthat i never go near.\"\\n\\nanne, amused in spite of herself, was rather distressed for an answer,\\nand the admiral, fearing he might not have been civil enough,\\ntook up the subject again, to say--\\n\\n\"the next time you write to your good father, miss elliot,\\npray give him my compliments and mrs croft\\'s, and say that we are\\nsettled here quite to our liking, and have no fault at all to find\\nwith the place.  the breakfast-room chimney smokes a little,\\ni grant you, but it is only when the wind is due north and blows hard,\\nwhich may not happen three times a winter.  and take it altogether,\\nnow that we have been into most of the houses hereabouts and can judge,\\nthere is not one that we like better than this.  pray say so,\\nwith my compliments.  he will be glad to hear it.\"\\n\\nlady russell and mrs croft were very well pleased with each other:\\nbut the acquaintance which this visit began was fated not to proceed\\nfar at present; for when it was returned, the crofts announced\\nthemselves to be going away for a few weeks, to visit their connexions\\nin the north of the county, and probably might not be at home again\\nbefore lady russell would be removing to bath.\\n\\nso ended all danger to anne of meeting captain wentworth at kellynch hall,\\nor of seeing him in company with her friend.  everything was safe enough,\\nand she smiled over the many anxious feelings she had wasted\\non the subject.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 14\\n\\n\\nthough charles and mary had remained at lyme much longer after\\nmr and mrs musgrove\\'s going than anne conceived they could have been\\nat all wanted, they were yet the first of the family to be at home again;\\nand as soon as possible after their return to uppercross\\nthey drove over to the lodge.  they had left louisa beginning to sit up;\\nbut her head, though clear, was exceedingly weak, and her nerves\\nsusceptible to the highest extreme of tenderness; and though\\nshe might be pronounced to be altogether doing very well,\\nit was still impossible to say when she might be able to bear\\nthe removal home; and her father and mother, who must return\\nin time to receive their younger children for the christmas holidays,\\nhad hardly a hope of being allowed to bring her with them.\\n\\nthey had been all in lodgings together.  mrs musgrove had\\ngot mrs harville\\'s children away as much as she could, every possible\\nsupply from uppercross had been furnished, to lighten the inconvenience\\nto the harvilles, while the harvilles had been wanting them\\nto come to dinner every day; and in short, it seemed to have been\\nonly a struggle on each side as to which should be most disinterested\\nand hospitable.\\n\\nmary had had her evils; but upon the whole, as was evident\\nby her staying so long, she had found more to enjoy than to suffer.\\ncharles hayter had been at lyme oftener than suited her; and when\\nthey dined with the harvilles there had been only a maid-servant to wait,\\nand at first mrs harville had always given mrs musgrove precedence;\\nbut then, she had received so very handsome an apology from her\\non finding out whose daughter she was, and there had been so much\\ngoing on every day, there had been so many walks between their lodgings\\nand the harvilles, and she had got books from the library,\\nand changed them so often, that the balance had certainly been\\nmuch in favour of lyme.  she had been taken to charmouth too,\\nand she had bathed, and she had gone to church, and there were a great many\\nmore people to look at in the church at lyme than at uppercross;\\nand all this, joined to the sense of being so very useful,\\nhad made really an agreeable fortnight.\\n\\nanne enquired after captain benwick, mary\\'s face was clouded directly.\\ncharles laughed.\\n\\n\"oh! captain benwick is very well, i believe, but he is\\na very odd young man.  i do not know what he would be at.\\nwe asked him to come home with us for a day or two:  charles undertook\\nto give him some shooting, and he seemed quite delighted, and, for my part,\\ni thought it was all settled; when behold! on tuesday night,\\nhe made a very awkward sort of excuse; `he never shot\\' and he had\\n`been quite misunderstood,\\' and he had promised this and he had\\npromised that, and the end of it was, i found, that he did not mean to come.\\ni suppose he was afraid of finding it dull; but upon my word\\ni should have thought we were lively enough at the cottage\\nfor such a heart-broken man as captain benwick.\"\\n\\ncharles laughed again and said, \"now mary, you know very well\\nhow it really was.  it was all your doing,\" (turning to anne.)\\n\"he fancied that if he went with us, he should find you close by:\\nhe fancied everybody to be living in uppercross; and when he discovered\\nthat lady russell lived three miles off, his heart failed him,\\nand he had not courage to come.  that is the fact, upon my honour,\\nmary knows it is.\"\\n\\nbut mary did not give into it very graciously, whether from\\nnot considering captain benwick entitled by birth and situation\\nto be in love with an elliot, or from not wanting to believe\\nanne a greater attraction to uppercross than herself, must be\\nleft to be guessed.  anne\\'s good-will, however, was not to be lessened\\nby what she heard.  she boldly acknowledged herself flattered,\\nand continued her enquiries.\\n\\n\"oh! he talks of you,\" cried charles, \"in such terms--\"\\nmary interrupted him. \"i declare, charles, i never heard him\\nmention anne twice all the time i was there.  i declare, anne,\\nhe never talks of you at all.\"\\n\\n\"no,\" admitted charles, \"i do not know that he ever does, in a general\\nway; but however, it is a very clear thing that he admires you exceedingly.\\nhis head is full of some books that he is reading upon your recommendation,\\nand he wants to talk to you about them; he has found out something or other\\nin one of them which he thinks--oh! i cannot pretend to remember it,\\nbut it was something very fine--i overheard him telling henrietta\\nall about it; and then `miss elliot\\' was spoken of in the highest terms!\\nnow mary, i declare it was so, i heard it myself, and you were\\nin the other room.  `elegance, sweetness, beauty.\\' oh! there was no end\\nof miss elliot\\'s charms.\"\\n\\n\"and i am sure,\" cried mary, warmly, \"it was a very little to his credit,\\nif he did.  miss harville only died last june.  such a heart\\nis very little worth having; is it, lady russell?  i am sure\\nyou will agree with me.\"\\n\\n\"i must see captain benwick before i decide,\" said lady russell, smiling.\\n\\n\"and that you are very likely to do very soon, i can tell you, ma\\'am,\"\\nsaid charles.  \"though he had not nerves for coming away with us,\\nand setting off again afterwards to pay a formal visit here,\\nhe will make his way over to kellynch one day by himself,\\nyou may depend on it.  i told him the distance and the road,\\nand i told him of the church\\'s being so very well worth seeing;\\nfor as he has a taste for those sort of things, i thought that would\\nbe a good excuse, and he listened with all his understanding and soul;\\nand i am sure from his manner that you will have him calling here soon.\\nso, i give you notice, lady russell.\"\\n\\n\"any acquaintance of anne\\'s will always be welcome to me,\"\\nwas lady russell\\'s kind answer.\\n\\n\"oh! as to being anne\\'s acquaintance,\" said mary, \"i think he is rather\\nmy acquaintance, for i have been seeing him every day this last fortnight.\"\\n\\n\"well, as your joint acquaintance, then, i shall be very happy\\nto see captain benwick.\"\\n\\n\"you will not find anything very agreeable in him, i assure you, ma\\'am.\\nhe is one of the dullest young men that ever lived.  he has walked with me,\\nsometimes, from one end of the sands to the other, without saying a word.\\nhe is not at all a well-bred young man.  i am sure you will not like him.\"\\n\\n\"there we differ, mary,\" said anne.  \"i think lady russell would like him.\\ni think she would be so much pleased with his mind, that she would\\nvery soon see no deficiency in his manner.\"\\n\\n\"so do i, anne,\" said charles.  \"i am sure lady russell would like him.\\nhe is just lady russell\\'s sort.  give him a book, and he will\\nread all day long.\"\\n\\n\"yes, that he will!\" exclaimed mary, tauntingly.  \"he will sit poring\\nover his book, and not know when a person speaks to him, or when one\\ndrop\\'s one\\'s scissors, or anything that happens.  do you think\\nlady russell would like that?\"\\n\\nlady russell could not help laughing.  \"upon my word,\" said she,\\n\"i should not have supposed that my opinion of any one could have\\nadmitted of such difference of conjecture, steady and matter of fact\\nas i may call myself.  i have really a curiosity to see the person\\nwho can give occasion to such directly opposite notions.\\ni wish he may be induced to call here.  and when he does, mary,\\nyou may depend upon hearing my opinion; but i am determined\\nnot to judge him beforehand.\"\\n\\n\"you will not like him, i will answer for it.\"\\n\\nlady russell began talking of something else.  mary spoke with animation\\nof their meeting with, or rather missing, mr elliot so extraordinarily.\\n\\n\"he is a man,\" said lady russell, \"whom i have no wish to see.\\nhis declining to be on cordial terms with the head of his family,\\nhas left a very strong impression in his disfavour with me.\"\\n\\nthis decision checked mary\\'s eagerness, and stopped her short\\nin the midst of the elliot countenance.\\n\\nwith regard to captain wentworth, though anne hazarded no enquiries,\\nthere was voluntary communication sufficient.  his spirits had been\\ngreatly recovering lately as might be expected.  as louisa improved,\\nhe had improved, and he was now quite a different creature\\nfrom what he had been the first week.  he had not seen louisa;\\nand was so extremely fearful of any ill consequence to her\\nfrom an interview, that he did not press for it at all; and,\\non the contrary, seemed to have a plan of going away for a week\\nor ten days, till her head was stronger.  he had talked of going\\ndown to plymouth for a week, and wanted to persuade captain benwick\\nto go with him; but, as charles maintained to the last, captain benwick\\nseemed much more disposed to ride over to kellynch.\\n\\nthere can be no doubt that lady russell and anne were both\\noccasionally thinking of captain benwick, from this time.\\nlady russell could not hear the door-bell without feeling that it might\\nbe his herald; nor could anne return from any stroll of solitary indulgence\\nin her father\\'s grounds, or any visit of charity in the village,\\nwithout wondering whether she might see him or hear of him.\\ncaptain benwick came not, however.  he was either less disposed for it\\nthan charles had imagined, or he was too shy; and after giving him\\na week\\'s indulgence, lady russell determined him to be unworthy\\nof the interest which he had been beginning to excite.\\n\\nthe musgroves came back to receive their happy boys and girls from school,\\nbringing with them mrs harville\\'s little children, to improve the noise\\nof uppercross, and lessen that of lyme.  henrietta remained with louisa;\\nbut all the rest of the family were again in their usual quarters.\\n\\nlady russell and anne paid their compliments to them once,\\nwhen anne could not but feel that uppercross was already quite alive again.\\nthough neither henrietta, nor louisa, nor charles hayter,\\nnor captain wentworth were there, the room presented as strong a contrast\\nas could be wished to the last state she had seen it in.\\n\\nimmediately surrounding mrs musgrove were the little harvilles,\\nwhom she was sedulously guarding from the tyranny of the two children\\nfrom the cottage, expressly arrived to amuse them.  on one side\\nwas a table occupied by some chattering girls, cutting up silk\\nand gold paper; and on the other were tressels and trays,\\nbending under the weight of brawn and cold pies, where riotous boys\\nwere holding high revel; the whole completed by a roaring christmas fire,\\nwhich seemed determined to be heard, in spite of all the noise\\nof the others.  charles and mary also came in, of course,\\nduring their visit, and mr musgrove made a point of paying his respects\\nto lady russell, and sat down close to her for ten minutes,\\ntalking with a very raised voice, but from the clamour of the children\\non his knees, generally in vain.  it was a fine family-piece.\\n\\nanne, judging from her own temperament, would have deemed\\nsuch a domestic hurricane a bad restorative of the nerves,\\nwhich louisa\\'s illness must have so greatly shaken.  but mrs musgrove,\\nwho got anne near her on purpose to thank her most cordially,\\nagain and again, for all her attentions to them, concluded\\na short recapitulation of what she had suffered herself by observing,\\nwith a happy glance round the room, that after all she had gone through,\\nnothing was so likely to do her good as a little quiet cheerfulness\\nat home.\\n\\nlouisa was now recovering apace.  her mother could even think of her\\nbeing able to join their party at home, before her brothers and sisters\\nwent to school again.  the harvilles had promised to come with her\\nand stay at uppercross, whenever she returned.  captain wentworth was gone,\\nfor the present, to see his brother in shropshire.\\n\\n\"i hope i shall remember, in future,\" said lady russell, as soon as\\nthey were reseated in the carriage, \"not to call at uppercross\\nin the christmas holidays.\"\\n\\neverybody has their taste in noises as well as in other matters;\\nand sounds are quite innoxious, or most distressing, by their sort\\nrather than their quantity.  when lady russell not long afterwards,\\nwas entering bath on a wet afternoon, and driving through\\nthe long course of streets from the old bridge to camden place,\\namidst the dash of other carriages, the heavy rumble of carts and drays,\\nthe bawling of newspapermen, muffin-men and milkmen, and the ceaseless\\nclink of pattens, she made no complaint.  no, these were noises\\nwhich belonged to the winter pleasures; her spirits rose\\nunder their influence; and like mrs musgrove, she was feeling,\\nthough not saying, that after being long in the country, nothing could be\\nso good for her as a little quiet cheerfulness.\\n\\nanne did not share these feelings.  she persisted in a very determined,\\nthough very silent disinclination for bath; caught the first dim view\\nof the extensive buildings, smoking in rain, without any wish\\nof seeing them better; felt their progress through the streets to be,\\nhowever disagreeable, yet too rapid; for who would be glad to see her\\nwhen she arrived?  and looked back, with fond regret, to the bustles\\nof uppercross and the seclusion of kellynch.\\n\\nelizabeth\\'s last letter had communicated a piece of news of some interest.\\nmr elliot was in bath.  he had called in camden place; had called\\na second time, a third; had been pointedly attentive.  if elizabeth\\nand her father did not deceive themselves, had been taking much pains\\nto seek the acquaintance, and proclaim the value of the connection,\\nas he had formerly taken pains to shew neglect.  this was very wonderful\\nif it were true; and lady russell was in a state of very agreeable\\ncuriosity and perplexity about mr elliot, already recanting the sentiment\\nshe had so lately expressed to mary, of his being \"a man whom she had\\nno wish to see.\"  she had a great wish to see him.  if he really sought\\nto reconcile himself like a dutiful branch, he must be forgiven\\nfor having dismembered himself from the paternal tree.\\n\\nanne was not animated to an equal pitch by the circumstance,\\nbut she felt that she would rather see mr elliot again than not,\\nwhich was more than she could say for many other persons in bath.\\n\\nshe was put down in camden place; and lady russell then drove\\nto her own lodgings, in rivers street.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 15\\n\\n\\nsir walter had taken a very good house in camden place,\\na lofty dignified situation, such as becomes a man of consequence;\\nand both he and elizabeth were settled there, much to their satisfaction.\\n\\nanne entered it with a sinking heart, anticipating an imprisonment\\nof many months, and anxiously saying to herself, \"oh! when shall i\\nleave you again?\"  a degree of unexpected cordiality, however,\\nin the welcome she received, did her good.  her father and sister\\nwere glad to see her, for the sake of shewing her the house and furniture,\\nand met her with kindness.  her making a fourth, when they\\nsat down to dinner, was noticed as an advantage.\\n\\nmrs clay was very pleasant, and very smiling, but her courtesies and smiles\\nwere more a matter of course.  anne had always felt that she would\\npretend what was proper on her arrival, but the complaisance of the others\\nwas unlooked for.  they were evidently in excellent spirits,\\nand she was soon to listen to the causes.  they had no inclination\\nto listen to her.  after laying out for some compliments of being\\ndeeply regretted in their old neighbourhood, which anne could not pay,\\nthey had only a few faint enquiries to make, before the talk must be\\nall their own.  uppercross excited no interest, kellynch very little:\\nit was all bath.\\n\\nthey had the pleasure of assuring her that bath more than answered\\ntheir expectations in every respect.  their house was undoubtedly\\nthe best in camden place; their drawing-rooms had many decided advantages\\nover all the others which they had either seen or heard of,\\nand the superiority was not less in the style of the fitting-up,\\nor the taste of the furniture.  their acquaintance was\\nexceedingly sought after.  everybody was wanting to visit them.\\nthey had drawn back from many introductions, and still were\\nperpetually having cards left by people of whom they knew nothing.\\n\\nhere were funds of enjoyment.  could anne wonder that her father\\nand sister were happy?  she might not wonder, but she must sigh\\nthat her father should feel no degradation in his change, should see\\nnothing to regret in the duties and dignity of the resident landholder,\\nshould find so much to be vain of in the littlenesses of a town;\\nand she must sigh, and smile, and wonder too, as elizabeth threw open\\nthe folding-doors and walked with exultation from one drawing-room\\nto the other, boasting of their space; at the possibility of that woman,\\nwho had been mistress of kellynch hall, finding extent to be proud of\\nbetween two walls, perhaps thirty feet asunder.\\n\\nbut this was not all which they had to make them happy.\\nthey had mr elliot too.  anne had a great deal to hear of mr elliot.\\nhe was not only pardoned, they were delighted with him.\\nhe had been in bath about a fortnight; (he had passed through bath\\nin november, in his way to london, when the intelligence of\\nsir walter\\'s being settled there had of course reached him,\\nthough only twenty-four hours in the place, but he had not been able\\nto avail himself of it;) but he had now been a fortnight in bath,\\nand his first object on arriving, had been to leave his card\\nin camden place, following it up by such assiduous endeavours to meet,\\nand when they did meet, by such great openness of conduct,\\nsuch readiness to apologize for the past, such solicitude to be received\\nas a relation again, that their former good understanding\\nwas completely re-established.\\n\\nthey had not a fault to find in him.  he had explained away\\nall the appearance of neglect on his own side.  it had originated\\nin misapprehension entirely.  he had never had an idea of\\nthrowing himself off; he had feared that he was thrown off,\\nbut knew not why, and delicacy had kept him silent.  upon the hint\\nof having spoken disrespectfully or carelessly of the family\\nand the family honours, he was quite indignant.  he, who had ever boasted\\nof being an elliot, and whose feelings, as to connection,\\nwere only too strict to suit the unfeudal tone of the present day.\\nhe was astonished, indeed, but his character and general conduct\\nmust refute it.  he could refer sir walter to all who knew him;\\nand certainly, the pains he had been taking on this, the first opportunity\\nof reconciliation, to be restored to the footing of a relation\\nand heir-presumptive, was a strong proof of his opinions on the subject.\\n\\nthe circumstances of his marriage, too, were found to admit of\\nmuch extenuation.  this was an article not to be entered on by himself;\\nbut a very intimate friend of his, a colonel wallis, a highly\\nrespectable man, perfectly the gentleman, (and not an ill-looking man,\\nsir walter added), who was living in very good style in marlborough\\nbuildings, and had, at his own particular request, been admitted\\nto their acquaintance through mr elliot, had mentioned one or two things\\nrelative to the marriage, which made a material difference\\nin the discredit of it.\\n\\ncolonel wallis had known mr elliot long, had been well acquainted\\nalso with his wife, had perfectly understood the whole story.\\nshe was certainly not a woman of family, but well educated,\\naccomplished, rich, and excessively in love with his friend.\\nthere had been the charm.  she had sought him.  without that attraction,\\nnot all her money would have tempted elliot, and sir walter was,\\nmoreover, assured of her having been a very fine woman.\\nhere was a great deal to soften the business.  a very fine woman\\nwith a large fortune, in love with him!  sir walter seemed to admit it\\nas complete apology; and though elizabeth could not see the circumstance\\nin quite so favourable a light, she allowed it be a great extenuation.\\n\\nmr elliot had called repeatedly, had dined with them once,\\nevidently delighted by the distinction of being asked, for they\\ngave no dinners in general; delighted, in short, by every proof\\nof cousinly notice, and placing his whole happiness in being\\non intimate terms in camden place.\\n\\nanne listened, but without quite understanding it.  allowances,\\nlarge allowances, she knew, must be made for the ideas of those who spoke.\\nshe heard it all under embellishment.  all that sounded extravagant\\nor irrational in the progress of the reconciliation might have no origin\\nbut in the language of the relators.  still, however, she had\\nthe sensation of there being something more than immediately appeared,\\nin mr elliot\\'s wishing, after an interval of so many years,\\nto be well received by them.  in a worldly view, he had nothing to gain\\nby being on terms with sir walter; nothing to risk by a state of variance.\\nin all probability he was already the richer of the two,\\nand the kellynch estate would as surely be his hereafter as the title.\\na sensible man, and he had looked like a very sensible man,\\nwhy should it be an object to him?  she could only offer one solution;\\nit was, perhaps, for elizabeth\\'s sake.  there might really have been\\na liking formerly, though convenience and accident had drawn him\\na different way; and now that he could afford to please himself,\\nhe might mean to pay his addresses to her.  elizabeth was certainly\\nvery handsome, with well-bred, elegant manners, and her character\\nmight never have been penetrated by mr elliot, knowing her but in public,\\nand when very young himself.  how her temper and understanding\\nmight bear the investigation of his present keener time of life\\nwas another concern and rather a fearful one.  most earnestly did she wish\\nthat he might not be too nice, or too observant if elizabeth\\nwere his object; and that elizabeth was disposed to believe herself so,\\nand that her friend mrs clay was encouraging the idea, seemed apparent\\nby a glance or two between them, while mr elliot\\'s frequent visits\\nwere talked of.\\n\\nanne mentioned the glimpses she had had of him at lyme, but without\\nbeing much attended to.  \"oh! yes, perhaps, it had been mr elliot.\\nthey did not know.  it might be him, perhaps.\"  they could not listen\\nto her description of him.  they were describing him themselves;\\nsir walter especially.  he did justice to his very gentlemanlike\\nappearance, his air of elegance and fashion, his good shaped face,\\nhis sensible eye; but, at the same time, \"must lament his being\\nvery much under-hung, a defect which time seemed to have increased;\\nnor could he pretend to say that ten years had not altered\\nalmost every feature for the worse.  mr elliot appeared to think\\nthat he (sir walter) was looking exactly as he had done when\\nthey last parted;\" but sir walter had \"not been able to return\\nthe compliment entirely, which had embarrassed him.  he did not mean\\nto complain, however.  mr elliot was better to look at than most men,\\nand he had no objection to being seen with him anywhere.\"\\n\\nmr elliot, and his friends in marlborough buildings, were talked of\\nthe whole evening.  \"colonel wallis had been so impatient to be\\nintroduced to them! and mr elliot so anxious that he should!\"\\nand there was a mrs wallis, at present known only to them by description,\\nas she was in daily expectation of her confinement; but mr elliot\\nspoke of her as \"a most charming woman, quite worthy of being known\\nin camden place,\" and as soon as she recovered they were to be acquainted.\\nsir walter thought much of mrs wallis; she was said to be\\nan excessively pretty woman, beautiful.  \"he longed to see her.\\nhe hoped she might make some amends for the many very plain faces\\nhe was continually passing in the streets.  the worst of bath was\\nthe number of its plain women.  he did not mean to say that there were\\nno pretty women, but the number of the plain was out of all proportion.\\nhe had frequently observed, as he walked, that one handsome face\\nwould be followed by thirty, or five-and-thirty frights; and once,\\nas he had stood in a shop on bond street, he had counted\\neighty-seven women go by, one after another, without there being\\na tolerable face among them.  it had been a frosty morning,\\nto be sure, a sharp frost, which hardly one woman in a thousand\\ncould stand the test of.  but still, there certainly were\\na dreadful multitude of ugly women in bath; and as for the men!\\nthey were infinitely worse.  such scarecrows as the streets were full of!\\nit was evident how little the women were used to the sight of anything\\ntolerable, by the effect which a man of decent appearance produced.\\nhe had never walked anywhere arm-in-arm with colonel wallis\\n(who was a fine military figure, though sandy-haired) without observing\\nthat every woman\\'s eye was upon him; every woman\\'s eye was sure to be\\nupon colonel wallis.\"  modest sir walter!  he was not allowed\\nto escape, however.  his daughter and mrs clay united in hinting\\nthat colonel wallis\\'s companion might have as good a figure\\nas colonel wallis, and certainly was not sandy-haired.\\n\\n\"how is mary looking?\" said sir walter, in the height of his good humour.\\n\"the last time i saw her she had a red nose, but i hope that may not\\nhappen every day.\"\\n\\n\"oh! no, that must have been quite accidental.  in general she has been\\nin very good health and very good looks since michaelmas.\"\\n\\n\"if i thought it would not tempt her to go out in sharp winds,\\nand grow coarse, i would send her a new hat and pelisse.\"\\n\\nanne was considering whether she should venture to suggest that a gown,\\nor a cap, would not be liable to any such misuse, when a knock at the door\\nsuspended everything.  \"a knock at the door! and so late!\\nit was ten o\\'clock.  could it be mr elliot?  they knew he was to dine\\nin lansdown crescent.  it was possible that he might stop in his way home\\nto ask them how they did.  they could think of no one else.\\nmrs clay decidedly thought it mr elliot\\'s knock.\"  mrs clay was right.\\nwith all the state which a butler and foot-boy could give,\\nmr elliot was ushered into the room.\\n\\nit was the same, the very same man, with no difference but of dress.\\nanne drew a little back, while the others received his compliments,\\nand her sister his apologies for calling at so unusual an hour,\\nbut \"he could not be so near without wishing to know that neither she\\nnor her friend had taken cold the day before,\" &c. &c; which was\\nall as politely done, and as politely taken, as possible, but her part\\nmust follow then.  sir walter talked of his youngest daughter;\\n\"mr elliot must give him leave to present him to his youngest daughter\"\\n(there was no occasion for remembering mary); and anne, smiling and\\nblushing, very becomingly shewed to mr elliot the pretty features\\nwhich he had by no means forgotten, and instantly saw, with amusement\\nat his little start of surprise, that he had not been at all aware\\nof who she was.  he looked completely astonished, but not more astonished\\nthan pleased; his eyes brightened! and with the most perfect alacrity\\nhe welcomed the relationship, alluded to the past, and entreated\\nto be received as an acquaintance already.  he was quite as good-looking\\nas he had appeared at lyme, his countenance improved by speaking,\\nand his manners were so exactly what they ought to be, so polished,\\nso easy, so particularly agreeable, that she could compare them\\nin excellence to only one person\\'s manners.  they were not the same,\\nbut they were, perhaps, equally good.\\n\\nhe sat down with them, and improved their conversation very much.\\nthere could be no doubt of his being a sensible man.  ten minutes\\nwere enough to certify that.  his tone, his expressions,\\nhis choice of subject, his knowing where to stop; it was all\\nthe operation of a sensible, discerning mind.  as soon as he could,\\nhe began to talk to her of lyme, wanting to compare opinions\\nrespecting the place, but especially wanting to speak of the circumstance\\nof their happening to be guests in the same inn at the same time;\\nto give his own route, understand something of hers, and regret that\\nhe should have lost such an opportunity of paying his respects to her.\\nshe gave him a short account of her party and business at lyme.\\nhis regret increased as he listened.  he had spent his whole\\nsolitary evening in the room adjoining theirs; had heard voices,\\nmirth continually; thought they must be a most delightful set of people,\\nlonged to be with them, but certainly without the smallest suspicion\\nof his possessing the shadow of a right to introduce himself.\\nif he had but asked who the party were!  the name of musgrove would\\nhave told him enough.  \"well, it would serve to cure him of\\nan absurd practice of never asking a question at an inn,\\nwhich he had adopted, when quite a young man, on the principal\\nof its being very ungenteel to be curious.\\n\\n\"the notions of a young man of one or two and twenty,\" said he,\\n\"as to what is necessary in manners to make him quite the thing,\\nare more absurd, i believe, than those of any other set of beings\\nin the world.  the folly of the means they often employ\\nis only to be equalled by the folly of what they have in view.\"\\n\\nbut he must not be addressing his reflections to anne alone:\\nhe knew it; he was soon diffused again among the others,\\nand it was only at intervals that he could return to lyme.\\n\\nhis enquiries, however, produced at length an account of the scene\\nshe had been engaged in there, soon after his leaving the place.\\nhaving alluded to \"an accident,\"  he must hear the whole.\\nwhen he questioned, sir walter and elizabeth began to question also,\\nbut the difference in their manner of doing it could not be unfelt.\\nshe could only compare mr elliot to lady russell, in the wish\\nof really comprehending what had passed, and in the degree of concern\\nfor what she must have suffered in witnessing it.\\n\\nhe staid an hour with them.  the elegant little clock on the mantel-\\npiece had struck \"eleven with its silver sounds,\" and the watchman\\nwas beginning to be heard at a distance telling the same tale,\\nbefore mr elliot or any of them seemed to feel that he had been there long.\\n\\nanne could not have supposed it possible that her first evening in\\ncamden place could have passed so well!\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 16\\n\\n\\nthere was one point which anne, on returning to her family,\\nwould have been more thankful to ascertain even than mr elliot\\'s\\nbeing in love with elizabeth, which was, her father\\'s not being\\nin love with mrs clay; and she was very far from easy about it,\\nwhen she had been at home a few hours.  on going down to breakfast\\nthe next morning, she found there had just been a decent pretence\\non the lady\\'s side of meaning to leave them.  she could imagine mrs clay\\nto have said, that \"now miss anne was come, she could not suppose herself\\nat all wanted;\" for elizabeth was replying in a sort of whisper,\\n\"that must not be any reason, indeed.  i assure you i feel it none.\\nshe is nothing to me, compared with you;\"  and she was in full time\\nto hear her father say, \"my dear madam, this must not be.  as yet,\\nyou have seen nothing of bath.  you have been here only to be useful.\\nyou must not run away from us now.  you must stay to be acquainted\\nwith mrs wallis, the beautiful mrs wallis.  to your fine mind,\\ni well know the sight of beauty is a real gratification.\"\\n\\nhe spoke and looked so much in earnest, that anne was not surprised\\nto see mrs clay stealing a glance at elizabeth and herself.\\nher countenance, perhaps, might express some watchfulness;\\nbut the praise of the fine mind did not appear to excite a thought\\nin her sister.  the lady could not but yield to such joint entreaties,\\nand promise to stay.\\n\\nin the course of the same morning, anne and her father chancing to be\\nalone together, he began to compliment her on her improved looks;\\nhe thought her \"less thin in her person, in her cheeks; her skin,\\nher complexion, greatly improved; clearer, fresher.  had she been\\nusing any thing in particular?\"  \"no, nothing.\"  \"merely gowland,\"\\nhe supposed.  \"no, nothing at all.\"  \"ha! he was surprised at that;\"\\nand added, \"certainly you cannot do better than to continue as you are;\\nyou cannot be better than well; or i should recommend gowland,\\nthe constant use of gowland, during the spring months.  mrs clay has been\\nusing it at my recommendation, and you see what it has done for her.\\nyou see how it has carried away her freckles.\"\\n\\nif elizabeth could but have heard this!  such personal praise\\nmight have struck her, especially as it did not appear to anne\\nthat the freckles were at all lessened.  but everything must\\ntake its chance.  the evil of a marriage would be much diminished,\\nif elizabeth were also to marry.  as for herself, she might always\\ncommand a home with lady russell.\\n\\nlady russell\\'s composed mind and polite manners were put to some trial\\non this point, in her intercourse in camden place.  the sight of mrs clay\\nin such favour, and of anne so overlooked, was a perpetual provocation\\nto her there; and vexed her as much when she was away, as a person in bath\\nwho drinks the water, gets all the new publications, and has\\na very large acquaintance, has time to be vexed.\\n\\nas mr elliot became known to her, she grew more charitable,\\nor more indifferent, towards the others.  his manners were\\nan immediate recommendation; and on conversing with him she found\\nthe solid so fully supporting the superficial, that she was at first,\\nas she told anne, almost ready to exclaim, \"can this be mr elliot?\"\\nand could not seriously picture to herself a more agreeable\\nor estimable man.  everything united in him; good understanding,\\ncorrect opinions, knowledge of the world, and a warm heart.\\nhe had strong feelings of family attachment and family honour,\\nwithout pride or weakness; he lived with the liberality of a man of fortune,\\nwithout display; he judged for himself in everything essential,\\nwithout defying public opinion in any point of worldly decorum.\\nhe was steady, observant, moderate, candid; never run away with by spirits\\nor by selfishness, which fancied itself strong feeling; and yet,\\nwith a sensibility to what was amiable and lovely, and a value\\nfor all the felicities of domestic life, which characters of\\nfancied enthusiasm and violent agitation seldom really possess.\\nshe was sure that he had not been happy in marriage.  colonel wallis\\nsaid it, and lady russell saw it; but it had been no unhappiness\\nto sour his mind, nor (she began pretty soon to suspect) to prevent his\\nthinking of a second choice.  her satisfaction in mr elliot\\noutweighed all the plague of mrs clay.\\n\\nit was now some years since anne had begun to learn that she\\nand her excellent friend could sometimes think differently;\\nand it did not surprise her, therefore, that lady russell\\nshould see nothing suspicious or inconsistent, nothing to require\\nmore motives than appeared, in mr elliot\\'s great desire of a reconciliation.\\nin lady russell\\'s view, it was perfectly natural that mr elliot,\\nat a mature time of life, should feel it a most desirable object,\\nand what would very generally recommend him among all sensible people,\\nto be on good terms with the head of his family; the simplest process\\nin the world of time upon a head naturally clear, and only erring\\nin the heyday of youth.  anne presumed, however, still to smile about it,\\nand at last to mention \"elizabeth.\"  lady russell listened, and looked,\\nand made only this cautious reply:--\"elizabeth! very well;\\ntime will explain.\"\\n\\nit was a reference to the future, which anne, after a little observation,\\nfelt she must submit to.  she could determine nothing at present.\\nin that house elizabeth must be first; and she was in the habit\\nof such general observance as \"miss elliot,\" that any particularity\\nof attention seemed almost impossible.  mr elliot, too,\\nit must be remembered, had not been a widower seven months.\\na little delay on his side might be very excusable.  in fact,\\nanne could never see the crape round his hat, without fearing that\\nshe was the inexcusable one, in attributing to him such imaginations;\\nfor though his marriage had not been very happy, still it had existed\\nso many years that she could not comprehend a very rapid recovery\\nfrom the awful impression of its being dissolved.\\n\\nhowever it might end, he was without any question their\\npleasantest acquaintance in bath:  she saw nobody equal to him;\\nand it was a great indulgence now and then to talk to him about lyme,\\nwhich he seemed to have as lively a wish to see again, and to see more of,\\nas herself.  they went through the particulars of their first meeting\\na great many times.  he gave her to understand that he had\\nlooked at her with some earnestness.  she knew it well;\\nand she remembered another person\\'s look also.\\n\\nthey did not always think alike.  his value for rank and connexion\\nshe perceived was greater than hers.  it was not merely complaisance,\\nit must be a liking to the cause, which made him enter warmly\\ninto her father and sister\\'s solicitudes on a subject which\\nshe thought unworthy to excite them.  the bath paper one morning\\nannounced the arrival of the dowager viscountess dalrymple,\\nand her daughter, the honourable miss carteret; and all the comfort\\nof no.--, camden place, was swept away for many days; for the dalrymples\\n(in anne\\'s opinion, most unfortunately) were cousins of the elliots;\\nand the agony was how to introduce themselves properly.\\n\\nanne had never seen her father and sister before in contact with nobility,\\nand she must acknowledge herself disappointed.  she had hoped\\nbetter things from their high ideas of their own situation in life,\\nand was reduced to form a wish which she had never foreseen;\\na wish that they had more pride; for \"our cousins lady dalrymple\\nand miss carteret;\" \"our cousins, the dalrymples,\" sounded in her ears\\nall day long.\\n\\nsir walter had once been in company with the late viscount,\\nbut had never seen any of the rest of the family; and the difficulties\\nof the case arose from there having been a suspension of all intercourse\\nby letters of ceremony, ever since the death of that said late viscount,\\nwhen, in consequence of a dangerous illness of sir walter\\'s\\nat the same time, there had been an unlucky omission at kellynch.\\nno letter of condolence had been sent to ireland.  the neglect\\nhad been visited on the head of the sinner; for when poor lady elliot\\ndied herself, no letter of condolence was received at kellynch,\\nand, consequently, there was but too much reason to apprehend\\nthat the dalrymples considered the relationship as closed.\\nhow to have this anxious business set to rights, and be admitted\\nas cousins again, was the question:  and it was a question which,\\nin a more rational manner, neither lady russell nor mr elliot\\nthought unimportant.  \"family connexions were always worth preserving,\\ngood company always worth seeking; lady dalrymple had taken a house,\\nfor three months, in laura place, and would be living in style.\\nshe had been at bath the year before, and lady russell had heard her\\nspoken of as a charming woman.  it was very desirable that\\nthe connexion should be renewed, if it could be done, without any\\ncompromise of propriety on the side of the elliots.\"\\n\\nsir walter, however, would choose his own means, and at last wrote\\na very fine letter of ample explanation, regret, and entreaty,\\nto his right honourable cousin.  neither lady russell nor mr elliot\\ncould admire the letter; but it did all that was wanted,\\nin bringing three lines of scrawl from the dowager viscountess.\\n\"she was very much honoured, and should be happy in their acquaintance.\"\\nthe toils of the business were over, the sweets began.  they visited\\nin laura place, they had the cards of dowager viscountess dalrymple,\\nand the honourable miss carteret, to be arranged wherever they might\\nbe most visible:  and \"our cousins in laura place,\"--\"our cousin,\\nlady dalrymple and miss carteret,\" were talked of to everybody.\\n\\nanne was ashamed.  had lady dalrymple and her daughter even been\\nvery agreeable, she would still have been ashamed of the agitation\\nthey created, but they were nothing.  there was no superiority of manner,\\naccomplishment, or understanding.  lady dalrymple had acquired\\nthe name of \"a charming woman,\" because she had a smile and a civil answer\\nfor everybody.  miss carteret, with still less to say, was so plain\\nand so awkward, that she would never have been tolerated in camden place\\nbut for her birth.\\n\\nlady russell confessed she had expected something better; but yet\\n\"it was an acquaintance worth having;\" and when anne ventured to speak\\nher opinion of them to mr elliot, he agreed to their being nothing\\nin themselves, but still maintained that, as a family connexion,\\nas good company, as those who would collect good company around them,\\nthey had their value.  anne smiled and said,\\n\\n\"my idea of good company, mr elliot, is the company of clever,\\nwell-informed people, who have a great deal of conversation;\\nthat is what i call good company.\"\\n\\n\"you are mistaken,\" said he gently, \"that is not good company;\\nthat is the best.  good company requires only birth, education,\\nand manners, and with regard to education is not very nice.\\nbirth and good manners are essential; but a little learning is\\nby no means a dangerous thing in good company; on the contrary,\\nit will do very well.  my cousin anne shakes her head.\\nshe is not satisfied.  she is fastidious.  my dear cousin\"\\n(sitting down by her), \"you have a better right to be fastidious\\nthan almost any other woman i know; but will it answer?\\nwill it make you happy?  will it not be wiser to accept the society\\nof those good ladies in laura place, and enjoy all the advantages\\nof the connexion as far as possible?  you may depend upon it,\\nthat they will move in the first set in bath this winter,\\nand as rank is rank, your being known to be related to them\\nwill have its use in fixing your family (our family let me say)\\nin that degree of consideration which we must all wish for.\"\\n\\n\"yes,\" sighed anne, \"we shall, indeed, be known to be related to them!\"\\nthen recollecting herself, and not wishing to be answered, she added,\\n\"i certainly do think there has been by far too much trouble taken\\nto procure the acquaintance.  i suppose\" (smiling) \"i have more pride\\nthan any of you; but i confess it does vex me, that we should be\\nso solicitous to have the relationship acknowledged, which we may\\nbe very sure is a matter of perfect indifference to them.\"\\n\\n\"pardon me, dear cousin, you are unjust in your own claims.\\nin london, perhaps, in your present quiet style of living,\\nit might be as you say:  but in bath; sir walter elliot and his family\\nwill always be worth knowing:  always acceptable as acquaintance.\"\\n\\n\"well,\" said anne, \"i certainly am proud, too proud to enjoy a welcome\\nwhich depends so entirely upon place.\"\\n\\n\"i love your indignation,\" said he; \"it is very natural.\\nbut here you are in bath, and the object is to be established here\\nwith all the credit and dignity which ought to belong to sir walter elliot.\\nyou talk of being proud; i am called proud, i know, and i shall not wish\\nto believe myself otherwise; for our pride, if investigated,\\nwould have the same object, i have no doubt, though the kind may seem\\na little different.  in one point, i am sure, my dear cousin,\"\\n(he continued, speaking lower, though there was no one else in the room)\\n\"in one point, i am sure, we must feel alike.  we must feel that\\nevery addition to your father\\'s society, among his equals or superiors,\\nmay be of use in diverting his thoughts from those who are beneath him.\"\\n\\nhe looked, as he spoke, to the seat which mrs clay had been\\nlately occupying:  a sufficient explanation of what he particularly meant;\\nand though anne could not believe in their having the same sort of pride,\\nshe was pleased with him for not liking mrs clay; and her conscience\\nadmitted that his wishing to promote her father\\'s getting\\ngreat acquaintance was more than excusable in the view of defeating her.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 17\\n\\n\\nwhile sir walter and elizabeth were assiduously pushing their\\ngood fortune in laura place, anne was renewing an acquaintance\\nof a very different description.\\n\\nshe had called on her former governess, and had heard from her\\nof there being an old school-fellow in bath, who had the two strong claims\\non her attention of past kindness and present suffering.  miss hamilton,\\nnow mrs smith, had shewn her kindness in one of those periods of her life\\nwhen it had been most valuable.  anne had gone unhappy to school,\\ngrieving for the loss of a mother whom she had dearly loved,\\nfeeling her separation from home, and suffering as a girl of fourteen,\\nof strong sensibility and not high spirits, must suffer at such a time;\\nand miss hamilton, three years older than herself, but still from the want\\nof near relations and a settled home, remaining another year at school,\\nhad been useful and good to her in a way which had considerably lessened\\nher misery, and could never be remembered with indifference.\\n\\nmiss hamilton had left school, had married not long afterwards,\\nwas said to have married a man of fortune, and this was all\\nthat anne had known of her, till now that their governess\\'s account\\nbrought her situation forward in a more decided but very different form.\\n\\nshe was a widow and poor.  her husband had been extravagant;\\nand at his death, about two years before, had left his affairs\\ndreadfully involved.  she had had difficulties of every sort\\nto contend with, and in addition to these distresses had been afflicted\\nwith a severe rheumatic fever, which, finally settling in her legs,\\nhad made her for the present a cripple.  she had come to bath\\non that account, and was now in lodgings near the hot baths,\\nliving in a very humble way, unable even to afford herself\\nthe comfort of a servant, and of course almost excluded from society.\\n\\ntheir mutual friend answered for the satisfaction which a visit\\nfrom miss elliot would give mrs smith, and anne therefore\\nlost no time in going.  she mentioned nothing of what she had heard,\\nor what she intended, at home.  it would excite no proper interest there.\\nshe only consulted lady russell, who entered thoroughly into her sentiments,\\nand was most happy to convey her as near to mrs smith\\'s lodgings\\nin westgate buildings, as anne chose to be taken.\\n\\nthe visit was paid, their acquaintance re-established, their interest\\nin each other more than re-kindled.  the first ten minutes\\nhad its awkwardness and its emotion.  twelve years were gone\\nsince they had parted, and each presented a somewhat different person\\nfrom what the other had imagined.  twelve years had changed anne\\nfrom the blooming, silent, unformed girl of fifteen, to the elegant\\nlittle woman of seven-and-twenty, with every beauty except bloom,\\nand with manners as consciously right as they were invariably gentle;\\nand twelve years had transformed the fine-looking, well-grown miss hamilton,\\nin all the glow of health and confidence of superiority, into a poor,\\ninfirm, helpless widow, receiving the visit of her former protegee\\nas a favour; but all that was uncomfortable in the meeting had soon\\npassed away, and left only the interesting charm of remembering\\nformer partialities and talking over old times.\\n\\nanne found in mrs smith the good sense and agreeable manners which\\nshe had almost ventured to depend on, and a disposition to converse\\nand be cheerful beyond her expectation.  neither the dissipations\\nof the past--and she had lived very much in the world--nor the restrictions\\nof the present, neither sickness nor sorrow seemed to have\\nclosed her heart or ruined her spirits.\\n\\nin the course of a second visit she talked with great openness,\\nand anne\\'s astonishment increased.  she could scarcely imagine\\na more cheerless situation in itself than mrs smith\\'s.  she had been\\nvery fond of her husband:  she had buried him.  she had been\\nused to affluence:  it was gone.  she had no child to connect her\\nwith life and happiness again, no relations to assist in the arrangement\\nof perplexed affairs, no health to make all the rest supportable.\\nher accommodations were limited to a noisy parlour, and a dark bedroom\\nbehind, with no possibility of moving from one to the other without\\nassistance, which there was only one servant in the house to afford,\\nand she never quitted the house but to be conveyed into the warm bath.\\nyet, in spite of all this, anne had reason to believe that she had\\nmoments only of languor and depression, to hours of occupation\\nand enjoyment.  how could it be?  she watched, observed, reflected,\\nand finally determined that this was not a case of fortitude\\nor of resignation only.  a submissive spirit might be patient,\\na strong understanding would supply resolution, but here was something more;\\nhere was that elasticity of mind, that disposition to be comforted,\\nthat power of turning readily from evil to good, and of finding employment\\nwhich carried her out of herself, which was from nature alone.\\nit was the choicest gift of heaven; and anne viewed her friend\\nas one of those instances in which, by a merciful appointment,\\nit seems designed to counterbalance almost every other want.\\n\\nthere had been a time, mrs smith told her, when her spirits\\nhad nearly failed.  she could not call herself an invalid now,\\ncompared with her state on first reaching bath.  then she had, indeed,\\nbeen a pitiable object; for she had caught cold on the journey,\\nand had hardly taken possession of her lodgings before she was again\\nconfined to her bed and suffering under severe and constant pain;\\nand all this among strangers, with the absolute necessity of having\\na regular nurse, and finances at that moment particularly unfit\\nto meet any extraordinary expense.  she had weathered it, however,\\nand could truly say that it had done her good.  it had increased\\nher comforts by making her feel herself to be in good hands.\\nshe had seen too much of the world, to expect sudden or disinterested\\nattachment anywhere, but her illness had proved to her that her landlady\\nhad a character to preserve, and would not use her ill; and she had been\\nparticularly fortunate in her nurse, as a sister of her landlady,\\na nurse by profession, and who had always a home in that house\\nwhen unemployed, chanced to be at liberty just in time to attend her.\\n\"and she,\" said mrs smith, \"besides nursing me most admirably,\\nhas really proved an invaluable acquaintance.  as soon as i could\\nuse my hands she taught me to knit, which has been a great amusement;\\nand she put me in the way of making these little thread-cases,\\npin-cushions and card-racks, which you always find me so busy about,\\nand which supply me with the means of doing a little good\\nto one or two very poor families in this neighbourhood.\\nshe had a large acquaintance, of course professionally, among those\\nwho can afford to buy, and she disposes of my merchandise.\\nshe always takes the right time for applying.  everybody\\'s heart is open,\\nyou know, when they have recently escaped from severe pain,\\nor are recovering the blessing of health, and nurse rooke\\nthoroughly understands when to speak.  she is a shrewd, intelligent,\\nsensible woman.  hers is a line for seeing human nature; and she has\\na fund of good sense and observation, which, as a companion, make her\\ninfinitely superior to thousands of those who having only received\\n`the best education in the world,\\' know nothing worth attending to.\\ncall it gossip, if you will, but when nurse rooke has half an hour\\'s\\nleisure to bestow on me, she is sure to have something to relate\\nthat is entertaining and profitable:  something that makes one\\nknow one\\'s species better.  one likes to hear what is going on,\\nto be au fait as to the newest modes of being trifling and silly.\\nto me, who live so much alone, her conversation, i assure you, is a treat.\"\\n\\nanne, far from wishing to cavil at the pleasure, replied,\\n\"i can easily believe it.  women of that class have great opportunities,\\nand if they are intelligent may be well worth listening to.\\nsuch varieties of human nature as they are in the habit of witnessing!\\nand it is not merely in its follies, that they are well read;\\nfor they see it occasionally under every circumstance that can be\\nmost interesting or affecting.  what instances must pass before them\\nof ardent, disinterested, self-denying attachment, of heroism, fortitude,\\npatience, resignation:  of all the conflicts and all the sacrifices\\nthat ennoble us most.  a sick chamber may often furnish\\nthe worth of volumes.\"\\n\\n\"yes,\" said mrs smith more doubtingly, \"sometimes it may,\\nthough i fear its lessons are not often in the elevated style you describe.\\nhere and there, human nature may be great in times of trial;\\nbut generally speaking, it is its weakness and not its strength\\nthat appears in a sick chamber:  it is selfishness and impatience\\nrather than generosity and fortitude, that one hears of.\\nthere is so little real friendship in the world! and unfortunately\"\\n(speaking low and tremulously) \"there are so many who forget\\nto think seriously till it is almost too late.\"\\n\\nanne saw the misery of such feelings.  the husband had not been\\nwhat he ought, and the wife had been led among that part of mankind\\nwhich made her think worse of the world than she hoped it deserved.\\nit was but a passing emotion however with mrs smith; she shook it off,\\nand soon added in a different tone--\\n\\n\"i do not suppose the situation my friend mrs rooke is in at present,\\nwill furnish much either to interest or edify me.  she is only nursing\\nmrs wallis of marlborough buildings; a mere pretty, silly, expensive,\\nfashionable woman, i believe; and of course will have nothing to report\\nbut of lace and finery.  i mean to make my profit of mrs wallis, however.\\nshe has plenty of money, and i intend she shall buy all\\nthe high-priced things i have in hand now.\"\\n\\nanne had called several times on her friend, before the existence\\nof such a person was known in camden place.  at last, it became necessary\\nto speak of her. sir walter, elizabeth and mrs clay, returned one morning\\nfrom laura place, with a sudden invitation from lady dalrymple\\nfor the same evening, and anne was already engaged, to spend that evening\\nin westgate buildings.  she was not sorry for the excuse.\\nthey were only asked, she was sure, because lady dalrymple being\\nkept at home by a bad cold, was glad to make use of the relationship\\nwhich had been so pressed on her; and she declined on her own account\\nwith great alacrity--\"she was engaged to spend the evening\\nwith an old schoolfellow.\"  they were not much interested in anything\\nrelative to anne; but still there were questions enough asked,\\nto make it understood what this old schoolfellow was; and elizabeth\\nwas disdainful, and sir walter severe.\\n\\n\"westgate buildings!\" said he, \"and who is miss anne elliot\\nto be visiting in westgate buildings?  a mrs smith.  a widow mrs smith;\\nand who was her husband?  one of five thousand mr smiths whose names\\nare to be met with everywhere.  and what is her attraction?\\nthat she is old and sickly.  upon my word, miss anne elliot,\\nyou have the most extraordinary taste!  everything that revolts\\nother people, low company, paltry rooms, foul air, disgusting associations\\nare inviting to you.  but surely you may put off this old lady\\ntill to-morrow:  she is not so near her end, i presume,\\nbut that she may hope to see another day.  what is her age?  forty?\"\\n\\n\"no, sir, she is not one-and-thirty; but i do not think i can\\nput off my engagement, because it is the only evening for some time\\nwhich will at once suit her and myself.  she goes into the warm bath\\nto-morrow, and for the rest of the week, you know, we are engaged.\"\\n\\n\"but what does lady russell think of this acquaintance?\" asked elizabeth.\\n\\n\"she sees nothing to blame in it,\" replied anne; \"on the contrary,\\nshe approves it, and has generally taken me when i have\\ncalled on mrs smith.\\n\\n\"westgate buildings must have been rather surprised by the appearance\\nof a carriage drawn up near its pavement,\" observed sir walter.\\n\"sir henry russell\\'s widow, indeed, has no honours to distinguish her arms,\\nbut still it is a handsome equipage, and no doubt is well known\\nto convey a miss elliot.  a widow mrs smith lodging in westgate buildings!\\na poor widow barely able to live, between thirty and forty;\\na mere mrs smith, an every-day mrs smith, of all people and all names\\nin the world, to be the chosen friend of miss anne elliot,\\nand to be preferred by her to her own family connections among the nobility\\nof england and ireland!  mrs smith!  such a name!\"\\n\\nmrs clay, who had been present while all this passed, now thought it\\nadvisable to leave the room, and anne could have said much,\\nand did long to say a little in defence of her friend\\'s\\nnot very dissimilar claims to theirs, but her sense of personal respect\\nto her father prevented her.  she made no reply.  she left it\\nto himself to recollect, that mrs smith was not the only widow\\nin bath between thirty and forty, with little to live on,\\nand no surname of dignity.\\n\\nanne kept her appointment; the others kept theirs, and of course\\nshe heard the next morning that they had had a delightful evening.\\nshe had been the only one of the set absent, for sir walter\\nand elizabeth had not only been quite at her ladyship\\'s service themselves,\\nbut had actually been happy to be employed by her in collecting others,\\nand had been at the trouble of inviting both lady russell and mr elliot;\\nand mr elliot had made a point of leaving colonel wallis early,\\nand lady russell had fresh arranged all her evening engagements\\nin order to wait on her.  anne had the whole history of all that\\nsuch an evening could supply from lady russell.  to her,\\nits greatest interest must be, in having been very much talked of\\nbetween her friend and mr elliot; in having been wished for, regretted,\\nand at the same time honoured for staying away in such a cause.\\nher kind, compassionate visits to this old schoolfellow,\\nsick and reduced, seemed to have quite delighted mr elliot.\\nhe thought her a most extraordinary young woman; in her temper, manners,\\nmind, a model of female excellence.  he could meet even lady russell\\nin a discussion of her merits; and anne could not be given to understand\\nso much by her friend, could not know herself to be so highly rated\\nby a sensible man, without many of those agreeable sensations\\nwhich her friend meant to create.\\n\\nlady russell was now perfectly decided in her opinion of mr elliot.\\nshe was as much convinced of his meaning to gain anne in time as of\\nhis deserving her, and was beginning to calculate the number of weeks\\nwhich would free him from all the remaining restraints of widowhood,\\nand leave him at liberty to exert his most open powers of pleasing.\\nshe would not speak to anne with half the certainty she felt on the subject,\\nshe would venture on little more than hints of what might be hereafter,\\nof a possible attachment on his side, of the desirableness of the alliance,\\nsupposing such attachment to be real and returned.  anne heard her,\\nand made no violent exclamations; she only smiled, blushed,\\nand gently shook her head.\\n\\n\"i am no match-maker, as you well know,\" said lady russell,\\n\"being much too well aware of the uncertainty of all human events\\nand calculations.  i only mean that if mr elliot should some time hence\\npay his addresses to you, and if you should be disposed to accept him,\\ni think there would be every possibility of your being happy together.\\na most suitable connection everybody must consider it, but i think\\nit might be a very happy one.\"\\n\\n\"mr elliot is an exceedingly agreeable man, and in many respects\\ni think highly of him,\" said anne; \"but we should not suit.\"\\n\\nlady russell let this pass, and only said in rejoinder, \"i own that\\nto be able to regard you as the future mistress of kellynch,\\nthe future lady elliot, to look forward and see you occupying\\nyour dear mother\\'s place, succeeding to all her rights,\\nand all her popularity, as well as to all her virtues, would be\\nthe highest possible gratification to me.  you are your mother\\'s self\\nin countenance and disposition; and if i might be allowed to fancy you\\nsuch as she was, in situation and name, and home, presiding and blessing\\nin the same spot, and only superior to her in being more highly valued!\\nmy dearest anne, it would give me more delight than is often felt\\nat my time of life!\"\\n\\nanne was obliged to turn away, to rise, to walk to a distant table,\\nand, leaning there in pretended employment, try to subdue the feelings\\nthis picture excited.  for a few moments her imagination and her heart\\nwere bewitched.  the idea of becoming what her mother had been;\\nof having the precious name of \"lady elliot\" first revived in herself;\\nof being restored to kellynch, calling it her home again,\\nher home for ever, was a charm which she could not immediately resist.\\nlady russell said not another word, willing to leave the matter\\nto its own operation; and believing that, could mr elliot at that moment\\nwith propriety have spoken for himself!--she believed, in short,\\nwhat anne did not believe.  the same image of mr elliot speaking\\nfor himself brought anne to composure again.  the charm of kellynch\\nand of \"lady elliot\" all faded away.  she never could accept him.\\nand it was not only that her feelings were still adverse to any man\\nsave one; her judgement, on a serious consideration of the possibilities\\nof such a case was against mr elliot.\\n\\nthough they had now been acquainted a month, she could not be satisfied\\nthat she really knew his character.  that he was a sensible man,\\nan agreeable man, that he talked well, professed good opinions,\\nseemed to judge properly and as a man of principle, this was all\\nclear enough.  he certainly knew what was right, nor could she fix\\non any one article of moral duty evidently transgressed; but yet she would\\nhave been afraid to answer for his conduct.  she distrusted the past,\\nif not the present.  the names which occasionally dropt\\nof former associates, the allusions to former practices and pursuits,\\nsuggested suspicions not favourable of what he had been.\\nshe saw that there had been bad habits; that sunday travelling\\nhad been a common thing; that there had been a period of his life\\n(and probably not a short one) when he had been, at least,\\ncareless in all serious matters; and, though he might now think\\nvery differently, who could answer for the true sentiments of a clever,\\ncautious man, grown old enough to appreciate a fair character?\\nhow could it ever be ascertained that his mind was truly cleansed?\\n\\nmr elliot was rational, discreet, polished, but he was not open.\\nthere was never any burst of feeling, any warmth of indignation or delight,\\nat the evil or good of others.  this, to anne, was a decided imperfection.\\nher early impressions were incurable.  she prized the frank,\\nthe open-hearted, the eager character beyond all others.\\nwarmth and enthusiasm did captivate her still.  she felt that she could\\nso much more depend upon the sincerity of those who sometimes looked\\nor said a careless or a hasty thing, than of those whose presence of mind\\nnever varied, whose tongue never slipped.\\n\\nmr elliot was too generally agreeable.  various as were the tempers\\nin her father\\'s house, he pleased them all.  he endured too well,\\nstood too well with every body.  he had spoken to her with some\\ndegree of openness of mrs clay; had appeared completely to see\\nwhat mrs clay was about, and to hold her in contempt; and yet\\nmrs clay found him as agreeable as any body.\\n\\nlady russell saw either less or more than her young friend,\\nfor she saw nothing to excite distrust.  she could not imagine\\na man more exactly what he ought to be than mr elliot; nor did she\\never enjoy a sweeter feeling than the hope of seeing him receive\\nthe hand of her beloved anne in kellynch church, in the course of\\nthe following autumn.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 18\\n\\n\\nit was the beginning of february; and anne, having been a month in bath,\\nwas growing very eager for news from uppercross and lyme.\\nshe wanted to hear much more than mary had communicated.\\nit was three weeks since she had heard at all.  she only knew\\nthat henrietta was at home again; and that louisa, though considered to be\\nrecovering fast, was still in lyme; and she was thinking of them all\\nvery intently one evening, when a thicker letter than usual from mary\\nwas delivered to her; and, to quicken the pleasure and surprise,\\nwith admiral and mrs croft\\'s compliments.\\n\\nthe crofts must be in bath!  a circumstance to interest her.\\nthey were people whom her heart turned to very naturally.\\n\\n\"what is this?\" cried sir walter.  \"the crofts have arrived in bath?\\nthe crofts who rent kellynch?  what have they brought you?\"\\n\\n\"a letter from uppercross cottage, sir.\"\\n\\n\"oh! those letters are convenient passports.  they secure an introduction.\\ni should have visited admiral croft, however, at any rate.\\ni know what is due to my tenant.\"\\n\\nanne could listen no longer; she could not even have told how\\nthe poor admiral\\'s complexion escaped; her letter engrossed her.\\nit had been begun several days back.\\n\\n\\n            \"february 1st.\\n\\n\"my dear anne,--i make no apology for my silence, because i know\\nhow little people think of letters in such a place as bath.\\nyou must be a great deal too happy to care for uppercross, which,\\nas you well know, affords little to write about.  we have had\\na very dull christmas; mr and mrs musgrove have not had one dinner party\\nall the holidays.  i do not reckon the hayters as anybody.\\nthe holidays, however, are over at last:  i believe no children ever had\\nsuch long ones.  i am sure i had not.  the house was cleared yesterday,\\nexcept of the little harvilles; but you will be surprised to hear\\nthey have never gone home.  mrs harville must be an odd mother\\nto part with them so long.  i do not understand it.  they are\\nnot at all nice children, in my opinion; but mrs musgrove seems to\\nlike them quite as well, if not better, than her grandchildren.\\nwhat dreadful weather we have had!  it may not be felt in bath,\\nwith your nice pavements; but in the country it is of some consequence.\\ni have not had a creature call on me since the second week in january,\\nexcept charles hayter, who had been calling much oftener than was welcome.\\nbetween ourselves, i think it a great pity henrietta did not remain at lyme\\nas long as louisa; it would have kept her a little out of his way.\\nthe carriage is gone to-day, to bring louisa and the harvilles to-morrow.\\nwe are not asked to dine with them, however, till the day after,\\nmrs musgrove is so afraid of her being fatigued by the journey,\\nwhich is not very likely, considering the care that will be taken of her;\\nand it would be much more convenient to me to dine there to-morrow.\\ni am glad you find mr elliot so agreeable, and wish i could be acquainted\\nwith him too; but i have my usual luck:  i am always out of the way\\nwhen any thing desirable is going on; always the last of my family\\nto be noticed.  what an immense time mrs clay has been staying\\nwith elizabeth!  does she never mean to go away?  but perhaps\\nif she were to leave the room vacant, we might not be invited.\\nlet me know what you think of this.  i do not expect my children\\nto be asked, you know.  i can leave them at the great house very well,\\nfor a month or six weeks.  i have this moment heard that the crofts\\nare going to bath almost immediately; they think the admiral gouty.\\ncharles heard it quite by chance; they have not had the civility\\nto give me any notice, or of offering to take anything.\\ni do not think they improve at all as neighbours.  we see nothing of them,\\nand this is really an instance of gross inattention.  charles joins me\\nin love, and everything proper.  yours affectionately,\\n\\n  \"mary m---.\\n\\n\"i am sorry to say that i am very far from well; and jemima has\\njust told me that the butcher says there is a bad sore-throat\\nvery much about.  i dare say i shall catch it; and my sore-throats,\\nyou know, are always worse than anybody\\'s.\"\\n\\n\\nso ended the first part, which had been afterwards put into an envelope,\\ncontaining nearly as much more.\\n\\n\\n\"i kept my letter open, that i might send you word how louisa\\nbore her journey, and now i am extremely glad i did, having a great deal\\nto add.  in the first place, i had a note from mrs croft yesterday,\\noffering to convey anything to you; a very kind, friendly note indeed,\\naddressed to me, just as it ought; i shall therefore be able to\\nmake my letter as long as i like.  the admiral does not seem very ill,\\nand i sincerely hope bath will do him all the good he wants.\\ni shall be truly glad to have them back again.  our neighbourhood\\ncannot spare such a pleasant family.  but now for louisa.\\ni have something to communicate that will astonish you not a little.\\nshe and the harvilles came on tuesday very safely, and in the evening\\nwe went to ask her how she did, when we were rather surprised\\nnot to find captain benwick of the party, for he had been invited\\nas well as the harvilles; and what do you think was the reason?\\nneither more nor less than his being in love with louisa,\\nand not choosing to venture to uppercross till he had had an answer\\nfrom mr musgrove; for it was all settled between him and her\\nbefore she came away, and he had written to her father by captain harville.\\ntrue, upon my honour!  are not you astonished?  i shall be surprised\\nat least if you ever received a hint of it, for i never did.\\nmrs musgrove protests solemnly that she knew nothing of the matter.\\nwe are all very well pleased, however, for though it is not equal to her\\nmarrying captain wentworth, it is infinitely better than charles hayter;\\nand mr musgrove has written his consent, and captain benwick\\nis expected to-day.  mrs harville says her husband feels a good deal\\non his poor sister\\'s account; but, however, louisa is a great favourite\\nwith both.  indeed, mrs harville and i quite agree that we love her\\nthe better for having nursed her.  charles wonders what captain wentworth\\nwill say; but if you remember, i never thought him attached to louisa;\\ni never could see anything of it.  and this is the end, you see,\\nof captain benwick\\'s being supposed to be an admirer of yours.\\nhow charles could take such a thing into his head was always\\nincomprehensible to me.  i hope he will be more agreeable now.\\ncertainly not a great match for louisa musgrove, but a million times better\\nthan marrying among the hayters.\"\\n\\n\\nmary need not have feared her sister\\'s being in any degree prepared\\nfor the news.  she had never in her life been more astonished.\\ncaptain benwick and louisa musgrove!  it was almost too wonderful\\nfor belief, and it was with the greatest effort that she could remain\\nin the room, preserve an air of calmness, and answer the common questions\\nof the moment.  happily for her, they were not many.  sir walter\\nwanted to know whether the crofts travelled with four horses,\\nand whether they were likely to be situated in such a part of bath\\nas it might suit miss elliot and himself to visit in; but had\\nlittle curiosity beyond.\\n\\n\"how is mary?\" said elizabeth; and without waiting for an answer,\\n\"and pray what brings the crofts to bath?\"\\n\\n\"they come on the admiral\\'s account.  he is thought to be gouty.\"\\n\\n\"gout and decrepitude!\" said sir walter.  \"poor old gentleman.\"\\n\\n\"have they any acquaintance here?\" asked elizabeth.\\n\\n\"i do not know; but i can hardly suppose that, at admiral croft\\'s\\ntime of life, and in his profession, he should not have many acquaintance\\nin such a place as this.\"\\n\\n\"i suspect,\" said sir walter coolly, \"that admiral croft\\nwill be best known in bath as the renter of kellynch hall.\\nelizabeth, may we venture to present him and his wife in laura place?\"\\n\\n\"oh, no! i think not.  situated as we are with lady dalrymple, cousins,\\nwe ought to be very careful not to embarrass her with acquaintance\\nshe might not approve.  if we were not related, it would not signify;\\nbut as cousins, she would feel scrupulous as to any proposal of ours.\\nwe had better leave the crofts to find their own level.\\nthere are several odd-looking men walking about here, who,\\ni am told, are sailors.  the crofts will associate with them.\"\\n\\nthis was sir walter and elizabeth\\'s share of interest in the letter;\\nwhen mrs clay had paid her tribute of more decent attention,\\nin an enquiry after mrs charles musgrove, and her fine little boys,\\nanne was at liberty.\\n\\nin her own room, she tried to comprehend it.  well might charles wonder\\nhow captain wentworth would feel!  perhaps he had quitted the field,\\nhad given louisa up, had ceased to love, had found he did not love her.\\nshe could not endure the idea of treachery or levity, or anything\\nakin to ill usage between him and his friend.  she could not endure\\nthat such a friendship as theirs should be severed unfairly.\\n\\ncaptain benwick and louisa musgrove!  the high-spirited,\\njoyous-talking louisa musgrove, and the dejected, thinking,\\nfeeling, reading, captain benwick, seemed each of them everything\\nthat would not suit the other.  their minds most dissimilar!\\nwhere could have been the attraction?  the answer soon presented itself.\\nit had been in situation.  they had been thrown together several weeks;\\nthey had been living in the same small family party:  since henrietta\\'s\\ncoming away, they must have been depending almost entirely on each other,\\nand louisa, just recovering from illness, had been in an interesting state,\\nand captain benwick was not inconsolable.  that was a point which anne\\nhad not been able to avoid suspecting before; and instead of drawing\\nthe same conclusion as mary, from the present course of events,\\nthey served only to confirm the idea of his having felt some\\ndawning of tenderness toward herself.  she did not mean, however,\\nto derive much more from it to gratify her vanity, than mary\\nmight have allowed.  she was persuaded that any tolerably pleasing\\nyoung woman who had listened and seemed to feel for him would have\\nreceived the same compliment.  he had an affectionate heart.\\nhe must love somebody.\\n\\nshe saw no reason against their being happy.  louisa had fine\\nnaval fervour to begin with, and they would soon grow more alike.\\nhe would gain cheerfulness, and she would learn to be an enthusiast\\nfor scott and lord byron; nay, that was probably learnt already;\\nof course they had fallen in love over poetry.  the idea of\\nlouisa musgrove turned into a person of literary taste,\\nand sentimental reflection was amusing, but she had no doubt\\nof its being so.  the day at lyme, the fall from the cobb,\\nmight influence her health, her nerves, her courage, her character to\\nthe end of her life, as thoroughly as it appeared to have\\ninfluenced her fate.\\n\\nthe conclusion of the whole was, that if the woman who had been sensible\\nof captain wentworth\\'s merits could be allowed to prefer another man,\\nthere was nothing in the engagement to excite lasting wonder;\\nand if captain wentworth lost no friend by it, certainly nothing\\nto be regretted.  no, it was not regret which made anne\\'s heart\\nbeat in spite of herself, and brought the colour into her cheeks\\nwhen she thought of captain wentworth unshackled and free.\\nshe had some feelings which she was ashamed to investigate.\\nthey were too much like joy, senseless joy!\\n\\nshe longed to see the crofts; but when the meeting took place,\\nit was evident that no rumour of the news had yet reached them.\\nthe visit of ceremony was paid and returned; and louisa musgrove\\nwas mentioned, and captain benwick, too, without even half a smile.\\n\\nthe crofts had placed themselves in lodgings in gay street,\\nperfectly to sir walter\\'s satisfaction.  he was not at all ashamed\\nof the acquaintance, and did, in fact, think and talk a great deal more\\nabout the admiral, than the admiral ever thought or talked about him.\\n\\nthe crofts knew quite as many people in bath as they wished for,\\nand considered their intercourse with the elliots as a mere matter of form,\\nand not in the least likely to afford them any pleasure.\\nthey brought with them their country habit of being almost always together.\\nhe was ordered to walk to keep off the gout, and mrs croft\\nseemed to go shares with him in everything, and to walk\\nfor her life to do him good.  anne saw them wherever she went.\\nlady russell took her out in her carriage almost every morning,\\nand she never failed to think of them, and never failed to see them.\\nknowing their feelings as she did, it was a most attractive picture\\nof happiness to her.  she always watched them as long as she could,\\ndelighted to fancy she understood what they might be talking of,\\nas they walked along in happy independence, or equally delighted\\nto see the admiral\\'s hearty shake of the hand when he encountered\\nan old friend, and observe their eagerness of conversation\\nwhen occasionally forming into a little knot of the navy, mrs croft\\nlooking as intelligent and keen as any of the officers around her.\\n\\nanne was too much engaged with lady russell to be often walking herself;\\nbut it so happened that one morning, about a week or ten days\\nafter the croft\\'s arrival, it suited her best to leave her friend,\\nor her friend\\'s carriage, in the lower part of the town,\\nand return alone to camden place, and in walking up milsom street\\nshe had the good fortune to meet with the admiral.  he was standing\\nby himself at a printshop window, with his hands behind him,\\nin earnest contemplation of some print, and she not only might have\\npassed him unseen, but was obliged to touch as well as address him\\nbefore she could catch his notice.  when he did perceive and\\nacknowledge her, however, it was done with all his usual frankness\\nand good humour.  \"ha! is it you?  thank you, thank you.\\nthis is treating me like a friend.  here i am, you see,\\nstaring at a picture.  i can never get by this shop without stopping.\\nbut what a thing here is, by way of a boat!  do look at it.\\ndid you ever see the like?  what queer fellows your fine painters must be,\\nto think that anybody would venture their lives in such a shapeless\\nold cockleshell as that?  and yet here are two gentlemen\\nstuck up in it mightily at their ease, and looking about them at the rocks\\nand mountains, as if they were not to be upset the next moment,\\nwhich they certainly must be.  i wonder where that boat was built!\"\\n(laughing heartily); \"i would not venture over a horsepond in it.\\nwell,\" (turning away), \"now, where are you bound?  can i go anywhere\\nfor you, or with you?  can i be of any use?\"\\n\\n\"none, i thank you, unless you will give me the pleasure of your company\\nthe little way our road lies together.  i am going home.\"\\n\\n\\n\"that i will, with all my heart, and farther, too.  yes, yes\\nwe will have a snug walk together, and i have something to tell you\\nas we go along.  there, take my arm; that\\'s right; i do not\\nfeel comfortable if i have not a woman there.  lord! what a boat it is!\"\\ntaking a last look at the picture, as they began to be in motion.\\n\\n\"did you say that you had something to tell me, sir?\"\\n\\n\"yes, i have, presently.  but here comes a friend, captain brigden;\\ni shall only say, `how d\\'ye do?\\' as we pass, however.  i shall not stop.\\n`how d\\'ye do?\\'  brigden stares to see anybody with me but my wife.\\nshe, poor soul, is tied by the leg.  she has a blister on one of her heels,\\nas large as a three-shilling piece.  if you look across the street,\\nyou will see admiral brand coming down and his brother.  shabby fellows,\\nboth of them!  i am glad they are not on this side of the way.\\nsophy cannot bear them.  they played me a pitiful trick once:\\ngot away with some of my best men.  i will tell you the whole story\\nanother time.  there comes old sir archibald drew and his grandson.\\nlook, he sees us; he kisses his hand to you; he takes you for my wife.\\nah! the peace has come too soon for that younker.  poor old sir archibald!\\nhow do you like bath, miss elliot?  it suits us very well.\\nwe are always meeting with some old friend or other; the streets\\nfull of them every morning; sure to have plenty of chat;\\nand then we get away from them all, and shut ourselves in our lodgings,\\nand draw in our chairs, and are snug as if we were at kellynch,\\nay, or as we used to be even at north yarmouth and deal.\\nwe do not like our lodgings here the worse, i can tell you,\\nfor putting us in mind of those we first had at north yarmouth.\\nthe wind blows through one of the cupboards just in the same way.\"\\n\\nwhen they were got a little farther, anne ventured to press again\\nfor what he had to communicate.  she hoped when clear of milsom street\\nto have her curiosity gratified; but she was still obliged to wait,\\nfor the admiral had made up his mind not to begin till they had\\ngained the greater space and quiet of belmont; and as she was\\nnot really mrs croft, she must let him have his own way.\\nas soon as they were fairly ascending belmont, he began--\\n\\n\"well, now you shall hear something that will surprise you.\\nbut first of all, you must tell me the name of the young lady\\ni am going to talk about.  that young lady, you know, that we have\\nall been so concerned for.  the miss musgrove, that all this has been\\nhappening to.  her christian name:  i always forget her christian name.\"\\n\\nanne had been ashamed to appear to comprehend so soon as she really\\ndid; but now she could safely suggest the name of \"louisa.\"\\n\\n\"ay, ay, miss louisa musgrove, that is the name.  i wish young ladies\\nhad not such a number of fine christian names.  i should never be out\\nif they were all sophys, or something of that sort.  well,\\nthis miss louisa, we all thought, you know, was to marry frederick.\\nhe was courting her week after week.  the only wonder was,\\nwhat they could be waiting for, till the business at lyme came;\\nthen, indeed, it was clear enough that they must wait till her brain\\nwas set to right.  but even then there was something odd in their\\nway of going on.  instead of staying at lyme, he went off to plymouth,\\nand then he went off to see edward.  when we came back from minehead\\nhe was gone down to edward\\'s, and there he has been ever since.\\nwe have seen nothing of him since november.  even sophy could\\nnot understand it.  but now, the matter has take the strangest turn of all;\\nfor this young lady, the same miss musgrove, instead of being\\nto marry frederick, is to marry james benwick.  you know james benwick.\"\\n\\n\"a little.  i am a little acquainted with captain benwick.\"\\n\\n\"well, she is to marry him.  nay, most likely they are married already,\\nfor i do not know what they should wait for.\"\\n\\n\"i thought captain benwick a very pleasing young man,\" said anne,\\n\"and i understand that he bears an excellent character.\"\\n\\n\"oh! yes, yes, there is not a word to be said against james benwick.\\nhe is only a commander, it is true, made last summer, and these are\\nbad times for getting on, but he has not another fault that i know of.\\nan excellent, good-hearted fellow, i assure you; a very active,\\nzealous officer too, which is more than you would think for, perhaps,\\nfor that soft sort of manner does not do him justice.\"\\n\\n\"indeed you are mistaken there, sir; i should never augur want of spirit\\nfrom captain benwick\\'s manners.  i thought them particularly pleasing,\\nand i will answer for it, they would generally please.\"\\n\\n\"well, well, ladies are the best judges; but james benwick is rather too\\npiano for me; and though very likely it is all our partiality,\\nsophy and i cannot help thinking frederick\\'s manners better than his.\\nthere is something about frederick more to our taste.\"\\n\\nanne was caught.  she had only meant to oppose the too common idea\\nof spirit and gentleness being incompatible with each other,\\nnot at all to represent captain benwick\\'s manners as the very best\\nthat could possibly be; and, after a little hesitation,\\nshe was beginning to say, \"i was not entering into any comparison\\nof the two friends,\" but the admiral interrupted her with--\\n\\n\"and the thing is certainly true.  it is not a mere bit of gossip.\\nwe have it from frederick himself.  his sister had a letter\\nfrom him yesterday, in which he tells us of it, and he had just had it\\nin a letter from harville, written upon the spot, from uppercross.\\ni fancy they are all at uppercross.\"\\n\\nthis was an opportunity which anne could not resist; she said, therefore,\\n\"i hope, admiral, i hope there is nothing in the style of captain\\nwentworth\\'s letter to make you and mrs croft particularly uneasy.\\nit did seem, last autumn, as if there were an attachment between him\\nand louisa musgrove; but i hope it may be understood to have worn out\\non each side equally, and without violence.  i hope his letter\\ndoes not breathe the spirit of an ill-used man.\"\\n\\n\"not at all, not at all; there is not an oath or a murmur\\nfrom beginning to end.\"\\n\\nanne looked down to hide her smile.\\n\\n\"no, no; frederick is not a man to whine and complain; he has\\ntoo much spirit for that.  if the girl likes another man better,\\nit is very fit she should have him.\"\\n\\n\"certainly.  but what i mean is, that i hope there is nothing\\nin captain wentworth\\'s manner of writing to make you suppose\\nhe thinks himself ill-used by his friend, which might appear,\\nyou know, without its being absolutely said.  i should be very sorry\\nthat such a friendship as has subsisted between him and captain benwick\\nshould be destroyed, or even wounded, by a circumstance of this sort.\"\\n\\n\"yes, yes, i understand you.  but there is nothing at all of that nature\\nin the letter.  he does not give the least fling at benwick;\\ndoes not so much as say, `i wonder at it, i have a reason of my own\\nfor wondering at it.\\'  no, you would not guess, from his way of writing,\\nthat he had ever thought of this miss (what\\'s her name?) for himself.\\nhe very handsomely hopes they will be happy together; and there is\\nnothing very unforgiving in that, i think.\"\\n\\nanne did not receive the perfect conviction which the admiral meant\\nto convey, but it would have been useless to press the enquiry farther.\\nshe therefore satisfied herself with common-place remarks or quiet\\nattention, and the admiral had it all his own way.\\n\\n\"poor frederick!\" said he at last.  \"now he must begin all over again\\nwith somebody else.  i think we must get him to bath.  sophy must write,\\nand beg him to come to bath.  here are pretty girls enough, i am sure.\\nit would be of no use to go to uppercross again, for that other\\nmiss musgrove, i find, is bespoke by her cousin, the young parson.\\ndo not you think, miss elliot, we had better try to get him to bath?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 19\\n\\n\\nwhile admiral croft was taking this walk with anne, and expressing\\nhis wish of getting captain wentworth to bath, captain wentworth\\nwas already on his way thither.  before mrs croft had written,\\nhe was arrived, and the very next time anne walked out, she saw him.\\n\\nmr elliot was attending his two cousins and mrs clay.  they were\\nin milsom street.  it began to rain, not much, but enough to\\nmake shelter desirable for women, and quite enough to make it\\nvery desirable for miss elliot to have the advantage of being\\nconveyed home in lady dalrymple\\'s carriage, which was seen waiting\\nat a little distance; she, anne, and mrs clay, therefore,\\nturned into molland\\'s, while mr elliot stepped to lady dalrymple,\\nto request her assistance.  he soon joined them again, successful,\\nof course; lady dalrymple would be most happy to take them home,\\nand would call for them in a few minutes.\\n\\nher ladyship\\'s carriage was a barouche, and did not hold\\nmore than four with any comfort.  miss carteret was with her mother;\\nconsequently it was not reasonable to expect accommodation\\nfor all the three camden place ladies.  there could be no doubt\\nas to miss elliot.  whoever suffered inconvenience, she must suffer none,\\nbut it occupied a little time to settle the point of civility\\nbetween the other two.  the rain was a mere trifle, and anne was\\nmost sincere in preferring a walk with mr elliot.  but the rain was also\\na mere trifle to mrs clay; she would hardly allow it even to drop at all,\\nand her boots were so thick! much thicker than miss anne\\'s;\\nand, in short, her civility rendered her quite as anxious to be left\\nto walk with mr elliot as anne could be, and it was discussed between them\\nwith a generosity so polite and so determined, that the others were\\nobliged to settle it for them; miss elliot maintaining that mrs clay\\nhad a little cold already, and mr elliot deciding on appeal,\\nthat his cousin anne\\'s boots were rather the thickest.\\n\\nit was fixed accordingly, that mrs clay should be of the party\\nin the carriage; and they had just reached this point, when anne,\\nas she sat near the window, descried, most decidedly and distinctly,\\ncaptain wentworth walking down the street.\\n\\nher start was perceptible only to herself; but she instantly felt that\\nshe was the greatest simpleton in the world, the most unaccountable\\nand absurd!  for a few minutes she saw nothing before her;\\nit was all confusion.  she was lost, and when she had scolded\\nback her senses, she found the others still waiting for the carriage,\\nand mr elliot (always obliging) just setting off for union street\\non a commission of mrs clay\\'s.\\n\\nshe now felt a great inclination to go to the outer door;\\nshe wanted to see if it rained.  why was she to suspect herself\\nof another motive?  captain wentworth must be out of sight.\\nshe left her seat, she would go; one half of her should not be always\\nso much wiser than the other half, or always suspecting the other\\nof being worse than it was.  she would see if it rained.\\nshe was sent back, however, in a moment by the entrance of\\ncaptain wentworth himself, among a party of gentlemen and ladies,\\nevidently his acquaintance, and whom he must have joined\\na little below milsom street.  he was more obviously struck\\nand confused by the sight of her than she had ever observed before;\\nhe looked quite red.  for the first time, since their renewed acquaintance,\\nshe felt that she was betraying the least sensibility of the two.\\nshe had the advantage of him in the preparation of the last few moments.\\nall the overpowering, blinding, bewildering, first effects\\nof strong surprise were over with her.  still, however,\\nshe had enough to feel!  it was agitation, pain, pleasure,\\na something between delight and misery.\\n\\nhe spoke to her, and then turned away.  the character of his manner\\nwas embarrassment.  she could not have called it either cold or friendly,\\nor anything so certainly as embarrassed.\\n\\nafter a short interval, however, he came towards her, and spoke again.\\nmutual enquiries on common subjects passed:  neither of them, probably,\\nmuch the wiser for what they heard, and anne continuing fully sensible\\nof his being less at ease than formerly.  they had by dint of being\\nso very much together, got to speak to each other with a considerable\\nportion of apparent indifference and calmness; but he could not do it now.\\ntime had changed him, or louisa had changed him.  there was consciousness\\nof some sort or other.  he looked very well, not as if he had been\\nsuffering in health or spirits, and he talked of uppercross,\\nof the musgroves, nay, even of louisa, and had even a momentary look\\nof his own arch significance as he named her; but yet it was\\ncaptain wentworth not comfortable, not easy, not able to feign that he was.\\n\\nit did not surprise, but it grieved anne to observe that elizabeth\\nwould not know him.  she saw that he saw elizabeth, that elizabeth saw him,\\nthat there was complete internal recognition on each side;\\nshe was convinced that he was ready to be acknowledged as an acquaintance,\\nexpecting it, and she had the pain of seeing her sister turn away\\nwith unalterable coldness.\\n\\nlady dalrymple\\'s carriage, for which miss elliot was growing\\nvery impatient, now drew up; the servant came in to announce it.\\nit was beginning to rain again, and altogether there was a delay,\\nand a bustle, and a talking, which must make all the little crowd\\nin the shop understand that lady dalrymple was calling to convey\\nmiss elliot.  at last miss elliot and her friend, unattended but\\nby the servant, (for there was no cousin returned), were walking off;\\nand captain wentworth, watching them, turned again to anne,\\nand by manner, rather than words, was offering his services to her.\\n\\n\"i am much obliged to you,\" was her answer, \"but i am not going with them.\\nthe carriage would not accommodate so many.  i walk:  i prefer walking.\"\\n\\n\"but it rains.\"\\n\\n\"oh! very little,  nothing that i regard.\"\\n\\nafter a moment\\'s pause he said:  \"though i came only yesterday,\\ni have equipped myself properly for bath already, you see,\"\\n(pointing to a new umbrella); \"i wish you would make use of it,\\nif you are determined to walk; though i think it would be more prudent\\nto let me get you a chair.\"\\n\\nshe was very much obliged to him, but declined it all, repeating\\nher conviction, that the rain would come to nothing at present,\\nand adding, \"i am only waiting for mr elliot.  he will be here in a moment,\\ni am sure.\"\\n\\nshe had hardly spoken the words when mr elliot walked in.\\ncaptain wentworth recollected him perfectly.  there was no difference\\nbetween him and the man who had stood on the steps at lyme,\\nadmiring anne as she passed, except in the air and look and manner\\nof the privileged relation and friend.  he came in with eagerness,\\nappeared to see and think only of her, apologised for his stay,\\nwas grieved to have kept her waiting, and anxious to get her away\\nwithout further loss of time and before the rain increased;\\nand in another moment they walked off together, her arm under his,\\na gentle and embarrassed glance, and a \"good morning to you!\"\\nbeing all that she had time for, as she passed away.\\n\\nas soon as they were out of sight, the ladies of captain wentworth\\'s party\\nbegan talking of them.\\n\\n\"mr elliot does not dislike his cousin, i fancy?\"\\n\\n\"oh! no, that is clear enough.  one can guess what will happen there.\\nhe is always with them; half lives in the family, i believe.\\nwhat a very good-looking man!\"\\n\\n\"yes, and miss atkinson, who dined with him once at the wallises,\\nsays he is the most agreeable man she ever was in company with.\"\\n\\n\"she is pretty, i think; anne elliot; very pretty, when one comes\\nto look at her.  it is not the fashion to say so, but i confess\\ni admire her more than her sister.\"\\n\\n\"oh! so do i.\"\\n\\n\"and so do i.  no comparison.  but the men are all wild after miss elliot.\\nanne is too delicate for them.\"\\n\\nanne would have been particularly obliged to her cousin, if he would have\\nwalked by her side all the way to camden place, without saying a word.\\nshe had never found it so difficult to listen to him, though nothing\\ncould exceed his solicitude and care, and though his subjects\\nwere principally such as were wont to be always interesting:\\npraise, warm, just, and discriminating, of lady russell,\\nand insinuations highly rational against mrs clay.  but just now\\nshe could think only of captain wentworth.  she could not understand\\nhis present feelings, whether he were really suffering much\\nfrom disappointment or not; and till that point were settled,\\nshe could not be quite herself.\\n\\nshe hoped to be wise and reasonable in time; but alas! alas!\\nshe must confess to herself that she was not wise yet.\\n\\nanother circumstance very essential for her to know, was how long\\nhe meant to be in bath; he had not mentioned it, or she could not\\nrecollect it.  he might be only passing through.  but it was more probable\\nthat he should be come to stay.  in that case, so liable as every body was\\nto meet every body in bath, lady russell would in all likelihood\\nsee him somewhere.  would she recollect him?  how would it all be?\\n\\nshe had already been obliged to tell lady russell that louisa musgrove\\nwas to marry captain benwick.  it had cost her something to encounter\\nlady russell\\'s surprise; and now, if she were by any chance\\nto be thrown into company with captain wentworth, her imperfect knowledge\\nof the matter might add another shade of prejudice against him.\\n\\nthe following morning anne was out with her friend, and for the first hour,\\nin an incessant and fearful sort of watch for him in vain; but at last,\\nin returning down pulteney street, she distinguished him\\non the right hand pavement at such a distance as to have him in view\\nthe greater part of the street.  there were many other men about him,\\nmany groups walking the same way, but there was no mistaking him.\\nshe looked instinctively at lady russell; but not from any mad idea\\nof her recognising him so soon as she did herself.  no, it was\\nnot to be supposed that lady russell would perceive him till they\\nwere nearly opposite.  she looked at her however, from time to time,\\nanxiously; and when the moment approached which must point him out,\\nthough not daring to look again (for her own countenance she knew\\nwas unfit to be seen), she was yet perfectly conscious of\\nlady russell\\'s eyes being turned exactly in the direction for him--\\nof her being, in short, intently observing him.  she could thoroughly\\ncomprehend the sort of fascination he must possess over lady russell\\'s mind,\\nthe difficulty it must be for her to withdraw her eyes, the astonishment\\nshe must be feeling that eight or nine years should have passed over him,\\nand in foreign climes and in active service too, without robbing him\\nof one personal grace!\\n\\nat last, lady russell drew back her head.  \"now, how would she\\nspeak of him?\"\\n\\n\"you will wonder,\" said she, \"what has been fixing my eye so long;\\nbut i was looking after some window-curtains, which lady alicia and\\nmrs frankland were telling me of last night.  they described\\nthe drawing-room window-curtains of one of the houses on this\\nside of the way, and this part of the street, as being the handsomest\\nand best hung of any in bath, but could not recollect the exact number,\\nand i have been trying to find out which it could be; but i confess\\ni can see no curtains hereabouts that answer their description.\"\\n\\nanne sighed and blushed and smiled, in pity and disdain,\\neither at her friend or herself.  the part which provoked her most,\\nwas that in all this waste of foresight and caution, she should have\\nlost the right moment for seeing whether he saw them.\\n\\na day or two passed without producing anything.  the theatre or the rooms,\\nwhere he was most likely to be, were not fashionable enough\\nfor the elliots, whose evening amusements were solely in the\\nelegant stupidity of private parties, in which they were getting\\nmore and more engaged; and anne, wearied of such a state of stagnation,\\nsick of knowing nothing, and fancying herself stronger because\\nher strength was not tried, was quite impatient for the concert evening.\\nit was a concert for the benefit of a person patronised by lady dalrymple.\\nof course they must attend.  it was really expected to be a good one,\\nand captain wentworth was very fond of music.  if she could only have\\na few minutes conversation with him again, she fancied she should\\nbe satisfied; and as to the power of addressing him, she felt all over\\ncourage if the opportunity occurred.  elizabeth had turned from him,\\nlady russell overlooked him; her nerves were strengthened\\nby these circumstances; she felt that she owed him attention.\\n\\nshe had once partly promised mrs smith to spend the evening with her;\\nbut in a short hurried call she excused herself and put it off,\\nwith the more decided promise of a longer visit on the morrow.\\nmrs smith gave a most good-humoured acquiescence.\\n\\n\"by all means,\" said she; \"only tell me all about it, when you do come.\\nwho is your party?\"\\n\\nanne named them all.  mrs smith made no reply; but when she was\\nleaving her said, and with an expression half serious, half arch,\\n\"well, i heartily wish your concert may answer; and do not fail me\\nto-morrow if you can come; for i begin to have a foreboding\\nthat i may not have many more visits from you.\"\\n\\nanne was startled and confused; but after standing in a moment\\'s suspense,\\nwas obliged, and not sorry to be obliged, to hurry away.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 20\\n\\n\\nsir walter, his two daughters, and mrs clay, were the earliest\\nof all their party at the rooms in the evening; and as lady dalrymple\\nmust be waited for, they took their station by one of the fires\\nin the octagon room.  but hardly were they so settled, when the door\\nopened again, and captain wentworth walked in alone.  anne was\\nthe nearest to him, and making yet a little advance, she instantly spoke.\\nhe was preparing only to bow and pass on, but her gentle \"how do you do?\"\\nbrought him out of the straight line to stand near her, and make enquiries\\nin return, in spite of the formidable father and sister in the back ground.\\ntheir being in the back ground was a support to anne; she knew nothing\\nof their looks, and felt equal to everything which she believed\\nright to be done.\\n\\nwhile they were speaking, a whispering between her father and elizabeth\\ncaught her ear.  she could not distinguish, but she must guess the subject;\\nand on captain wentworth\\'s making a distant bow, she comprehended\\nthat her father had judged so well as to give him that\\nsimple acknowledgement of acquaintance, and she was just in time\\nby a side glance to see a slight curtsey from elizabeth herself.\\nthis, though late, and reluctant, and ungracious, was yet\\nbetter than nothing, and her spirits improved.\\n\\nafter talking, however, of the weather, and bath, and the concert,\\ntheir conversation began to flag, and so little was said at last,\\nthat she was expecting him to go every moment, but he did not;\\nhe seemed in no hurry to leave her; and presently with renewed spirit,\\nwith a little smile, a little glow, he said--\\n\\n\"i have hardly seen you since our day at lyme.  i am afraid you must have\\nsuffered from the shock, and the more from its not overpowering you\\nat the time.\"\\n\\nshe assured him that she had not.\\n\\n\"it was a frightful hour,\" said he, \"a frightful day!\" and he\\npassed his hand across his eyes, as if the remembrance were still\\ntoo painful, but in a moment, half smiling again, added,\\n\"the day has produced some effects however; has had some consequences\\nwhich must be considered as the very reverse of frightful.\\nwhen you had the presence of mind to suggest that benwick would be\\nthe properest person to fetch a surgeon, you could have little idea\\nof his being eventually one of those most concerned in her recovery.\"\\n\\n\"certainly i could have none.  but it appears--i should hope it would be\\na very happy match.  there are on both sides good principles\\nand good temper.\"\\n\\n\"yes,\" said he, looking not exactly forward; \"but there, i think,\\nends the resemblance.  with all my soul i wish them happy, and rejoice\\nover every circumstance in favour of it.  they have no difficulties\\nto contend with at home, no opposition, no caprice, no delays.\\nthe musgroves are behaving like themselves, most honourably and kindly,\\nonly anxious with true parental hearts to promote their daughter\\'s comfort.\\nall this is much, very much in favour of their happiness;\\nmore than perhaps--\"\\n\\nhe stopped.  a sudden recollection seemed to occur, and to give him\\nsome taste of that emotion which was reddening anne\\'s cheeks\\nand fixing her eyes on the ground.  after clearing his throat, however,\\nhe proceeded thus--\\n\\n\"i confess that i do think there is a disparity, too great a disparity,\\nand in a point no less essential than mind.  i regard louisa musgrove\\nas a very amiable, sweet-tempered girl, and not deficient in understanding,\\nbut benwick is something more.  he is a clever man, a reading man;\\nand i confess, that i do consider his attaching himself to her\\nwith some surprise.  had it been the effect of gratitude,\\nhad he learnt to love her, because he believed her to be preferring him,\\nit would have been another thing.  but i have no reason to suppose it so.\\nit seems, on the contrary, to have been a perfectly spontaneous,\\nuntaught feeling on his side, and this surprises me.  a man like him,\\nin his situation! with a heart pierced, wounded, almost broken!\\nfanny harville was a very superior creature, and his attachment to her\\nwas indeed attachment.  a man does not recover from such\\na devotion of the heart to such a woman.  he ought not; he does not.\"\\n\\neither from the consciousness, however, that his friend had recovered,\\nor from other consciousness, he went no farther; and anne who,\\nin spite of the agitated voice in which the latter part had been uttered,\\nand in spite of all the various noises of the room, the almost ceaseless\\nslam of the door, and ceaseless buzz of persons walking through,\\nhad distinguished every word, was struck, gratified, confused,\\nand beginning to breathe very quick, and feel an hundred things\\nin a moment.  it was impossible for her to enter on such a subject;\\nand yet, after a pause, feeling the necessity of speaking,\\nand having not the smallest wish for a total change, she only deviated\\nso far as to say--\\n\\n\"you were a good while at lyme, i think?\"\\n\\n\"about a fortnight.  i could not leave it till louisa\\'s doing well\\nwas quite ascertained.  i had been too deeply concerned in the mischief\\nto be soon at peace.  it had been my doing, solely mine.\\nshe would not have been obstinate if i had not been weak.\\nthe country round lyme is very fine.  i walked and rode a great deal;\\nand the more i saw, the more i found to admire.\"\\n\\n\"i should very much like to see lyme again,\" said anne.\\n\\n\"indeed!  i should not have supposed that you could have found\\nanything in lyme to inspire such a feeling.  the horror and distress\\nyou were involved in, the stretch of mind, the wear of spirits!\\ni should have thought your last impressions of lyme must have been\\nstrong disgust.\"\\n\\n\"the last hours were certainly very painful,\" replied anne;\\n\"but when pain is over, the remembrance of it often becomes a pleasure.\\none does not love a place the less for having suffered in it,\\nunless it has been all suffering, nothing but suffering, which was\\nby no means the case at lyme.  we were only in anxiety and distress\\nduring the last two hours, and previously there had been a great deal\\nof enjoyment.  so much novelty and beauty! i have travelled so little,\\nthat every fresh place would be interesting to me; but there is real beauty\\nat lyme; and in short\" (with a faint blush at some recollections),\\n\"altogether my impressions of the place are very agreeable.\"\\n\\nas she ceased, the entrance door opened again, and the very party appeared\\nfor whom they were waiting.  \"lady dalrymple, lady dalrymple,\"\\nwas the rejoicing sound; and with all the eagerness compatible\\nwith anxious elegance, sir walter and his two ladies stepped forward\\nto meet her.  lady dalrymple and miss carteret, escorted by mr elliot\\nand colonel wallis, who had happened to arrive nearly at the same instant,\\nadvanced into the room.  the others joined them, and it was\\na group in which anne found herself also necessarily included.\\nshe was divided from captain wentworth.  their interesting,\\nalmost too interesting conversation must be broken up for a time,\\nbut slight was the penance compared with the happiness which brought it on!\\nshe had learnt, in the last ten minutes, more of his feelings\\ntowards louisa, more of all his feelings than she dared to think of;\\nand she gave herself up to the demands of the party, to the needful\\ncivilities of the moment, with exquisite, though agitated sensations.\\nshe was in good humour with all.  she had received ideas which\\ndisposed her to be courteous and kind to all, and to pity every one,\\nas being less happy than herself.\\n\\nthe delightful emotions were a little subdued, when on stepping back\\nfrom the group, to be joined again by captain wentworth, she saw\\nthat he was gone.  she was just in time to see him turn into\\nthe concert room.  he was gone; he had disappeared, she felt\\na moment\\'s regret.  but \"they should meet again.  he would look for her,\\nhe would find her out before the evening were over, and at present,\\nperhaps, it was as well to be asunder.  she was in need of\\na little interval for recollection.\"\\n\\nupon lady russell\\'s appearance soon afterwards, the whole party\\nwas collected, and all that remained was to marshal themselves,\\nand proceed into the concert room; and be of all the consequence\\nin their power, draw as many eyes, excite as many whispers,\\nand disturb as many people as they could.\\n\\nvery, very happy were both elizabeth and anne elliot as they walked in.\\nelizabeth arm in arm with miss carteret, and looking on the broad back\\nof the dowager viscountess dalrymple before her, had nothing to wish for\\nwhich did not seem within her reach; and anne--but it would be\\nan insult to the nature of anne\\'s felicity, to draw any comparison\\nbetween it and her sister\\'s; the origin of one all selfish vanity,\\nof the other all generous attachment.\\n\\nanne saw nothing, thought nothing of the brilliancy of the room.\\nher happiness was from within.  her eyes were bright and her cheeks glowed;\\nbut she knew nothing about it.  she was thinking only of\\nthe last half hour, and as they passed to their seats, her mind took\\na hasty range over it.  his choice of subjects, his expressions,\\nand still more his manner and look, had been such as she could see\\nin only one light.  his opinion of louisa musgrove\\'s inferiority,\\nan opinion which he had seemed solicitous to give, his wonder\\nat captain benwick, his feelings as to a first, strong attachment;\\nsentences begun which he could not finish, his half averted eyes\\nand more than half expressive glance, all, all declared that he had\\na heart returning to her at least; that anger, resentment, avoidance,\\nwere no more; and that they were succeeded, not merely by friendship\\nand regard, but by the tenderness of the past.  yes, some share of\\nthe tenderness of the past.  she could not contemplate the change\\nas implying less.  he must love her.\\n\\nthese were thoughts, with their attendant visions, which occupied\\nand flurried her too much to leave her any power of observation;\\nand she passed along the room without having a glimpse of him,\\nwithout even trying to discern him.  when their places were determined on,\\nand they were all properly arranged, she looked round to see\\nif he should happen to be in the same part of the room, but he was not;\\nher eye could not reach him; and the concert being just opening,\\nshe must consent for a time to be happy in a humbler way.\\n\\nthe party was divided and disposed of on two contiguous benches:\\nanne was among those on the foremost, and mr elliot had manoeuvred so well,\\nwith the assistance of his friend colonel wallis, as to have a seat by her.\\nmiss elliot, surrounded by her cousins, and the principal object\\nof colonel wallis\\'s gallantry, was quite contented.\\n\\nanne\\'s mind was in a most favourable state for the entertainment\\nof the evening; it was just occupation enough:  she had feelings for\\nthe tender, spirits for the gay, attention for the scientific,\\nand patience for the wearisome; and had never liked a concert better,\\nat least during the first act.  towards the close of it,\\nin the interval succeeding an italian song, she explained\\nthe words of the song to mr elliot.  they had a concert bill between them.\\n\\n\"this,\" said she, \"is nearly the sense, or rather the meaning of the words,\\nfor certainly the sense of an italian love-song must not be talked of,\\nbut it is as nearly the meaning as i can give; for i do not pretend\\nto understand the language.  i am a very poor italian scholar.\"\\n\\n\"yes, yes, i see you are.  i see you know nothing of the matter.\\nyou have only knowledge enough of the language to translate at sight\\nthese inverted, transposed, curtailed italian lines, into clear,\\ncomprehensible, elegant english.  you need not say anything more\\nof your ignorance.  here is complete proof.\"\\n\\n\"i will not oppose such kind politeness; but i should be sorry to be\\nexamined by a real proficient.\"\\n\\n\"i have not had the pleasure of visiting in camden place so long,\"\\nreplied he, \"without knowing something of miss anne elliot;\\nand i do regard her as one who is too modest for the world in general\\nto be aware of half her accomplishments, and too highly accomplished\\nfor modesty to be natural in any other woman.\"\\n\\n\"for shame! for shame! this is too much flattery.  i forget what we are\\nto have next,\" turning to the bill.\\n\\n\"perhaps,\" said mr elliot, speaking low, \"i have had a longer acquaintance\\nwith your character than you are aware of.\"\\n\\n\"indeed!  how so?  you can have been acquainted with it only since\\ni came to bath, excepting as you might hear me previously spoken of\\nin my own family.\"\\n\\n\"i knew you by report long before you came to bath.  i had heard you\\ndescribed by those who knew you intimately.  i have been acquainted\\nwith you by character many years.  your person, your disposition,\\naccomplishments, manner; they were all present to me.\"\\n\\nmr elliot was not disappointed in the interest he hoped to raise.\\nno one can withstand the charm of such a mystery.  to have been\\ndescribed long ago to a recent acquaintance, by nameless people,\\nis irresistible; and anne was all curiosity.  she wondered,\\nand questioned him eagerly; but in vain.  he delighted in being asked,\\nbut he would not tell.\\n\\n\"no, no, some time or other, perhaps, but not now.  he would mention\\nno names now; but such, he could assure her, had been the fact.\\nhe had many years ago received such a description of miss anne elliot\\nas had inspired him with the highest idea of her merit, and excited\\nthe warmest curiosity to know her.\"\\n\\nanne could think of no one so likely to have spoken with\\npartiality of her many years ago as the mr wentworth of monkford,\\ncaptain wentworth\\'s brother.  he might have been in mr elliot\\'s company,\\nbut she had not courage to ask the question.\\n\\n\"the name of anne elliot,\" said he, \"has long had an interesting sound to me.\\nvery long has it possessed a charm over my fancy; and, if i dared,\\ni would breathe my wishes that the name might never change.\"\\n\\nsuch, she believed, were his words; but scarcely had she\\nreceived their sound, than her attention was caught by other sounds\\nimmediately behind her, which rendered every thing else trivial.\\nher father and lady dalrymple were speaking.\\n\\n\"a well-looking man,\" said sir walter, \"a very well-looking man.\"\\n\\n\"a very fine young man indeed!\" said lady dalrymple.  \"more air\\nthan one often sees in bath.  irish, i dare say.\"\\n\\n\"no, i just know his name.  a bowing acquaintance.  wentworth;\\ncaptain wentworth of the navy.  his sister married my tenant\\nin somersetshire, the croft, who rents kellynch.\"\\n\\nbefore sir walter had reached this point, anne\\'s eyes had caught\\nthe right direction, and distinguished captain wentworth standing\\namong a cluster of men at a little distance.  as her eyes fell on him,\\nhis seemed to be withdrawn from her.  it had that appearance.\\nit seemed as if she had been one moment too late; and as long as she\\ndared observe, he did not look again:  but the performance\\nwas recommencing, and she was forced to seem to restore her attention\\nto the orchestra and look straight forward.\\n\\nwhen she could give another glance, he had moved away.  he could not have\\ncome nearer to her if he would; she was so surrounded and shut in:\\nbut she would rather have caught his eye.\\n\\nmr elliot\\'s speech, too, distressed her.  she had no longer\\nany inclination to talk to him.  she wished him not so near her.\\n\\nthe first act was over.  now she hoped for some beneficial change;\\nand, after a period of nothing-saying amongst the party, some of them\\ndid decide on going in quest of tea.  anne was one of the few who\\ndid not choose to move.  she remained in her seat, and so did lady russell;\\nbut she had the pleasure of getting rid of mr elliot; and she did not mean,\\nwhatever she might feel on lady russell\\'s account, to shrink from\\nconversation with captain wentworth, if he gave her the opportunity.\\nshe was persuaded by lady russell\\'s countenance that she had seen him.\\n\\nhe did not come however.  anne sometimes fancied she discerned him\\nat a distance, but he never came.  the anxious interval\\nwore away unproductively.  the others returned, the room filled again,\\nbenches were reclaimed and repossessed, and another hour of pleasure\\nor of penance was to be sat out, another hour of music was to give\\ndelight or the gapes, as real or affected taste for it prevailed.\\nto anne, it chiefly wore the prospect of an hour of agitation.\\nshe could not quit that room in peace without seeing captain wentworth\\nonce more, without the interchange of one friendly look.\\n\\nin re-settling themselves there were now many changes, the result of which\\nwas favourable for her.  colonel wallis declined sitting down again,\\nand mr elliot was invited by elizabeth and miss carteret, in a manner\\nnot to be refused, to sit between them; and by some other removals,\\nand a little scheming of her own,  anne was enabled to place herself\\nmuch nearer the end of the bench than she had been before,\\nmuch more within reach of a passer-by.  she could not do so,\\nwithout comparing herself with miss larolles, the inimitable miss larolles;\\nbut still she did it, and not with much happier effect;\\nthough by what seemed prosperity in the shape of an early abdication\\nin her next neighbours, she found herself at the very end of the bench\\nbefore the concert closed.\\n\\nsuch was her situation, with a vacant space at hand, when captain wentworth\\nwas again in sight.  she saw him not far off.  he saw her too;\\nyet he looked grave, and seemed irresolute, and only by very slow degrees\\ncame at last near enough to speak to her.  she felt that something\\nmust be the matter.  the change was indubitable.  the difference\\nbetween his present air and what it had been in the octagon room\\nwas strikingly great.  why was it?  she thought of her father,\\nof lady russell.  could there have been any unpleasant glances?\\nhe began by speaking of the concert gravely, more like the captain\\nwentworth of uppercross; owned himself disappointed, had expected singing;\\nand in short, must confess that he should not be sorry when it was over.\\nanne replied, and spoke in defence of the performance so well,\\nand yet in allowance for his feelings so pleasantly, that his countenance\\nimproved, and he replied again with almost a smile.  they talked\\nfor a few minutes more; the improvement held; he even looked down\\ntowards the bench, as if he saw a place on it well worth occupying;\\nwhen at that moment a touch on her shoulder obliged anne to turn round.\\nit came from mr elliot.  he begged her pardon, but she must be applied to,\\nto explain italian again.  miss carteret was very anxious to have\\na general idea of what was next to be sung.  anne could not refuse;\\nbut never had she sacrificed to politeness with a more suffering spirit.\\n\\na few minutes, though as few as possible, were inevitably consumed;\\nand when her own mistress again, when able to turn and look\\nas she had done before, she found herself accosted by captain wentworth,\\nin a reserved yet hurried sort of farewell.  \"he must wish her good night;\\nhe was going; he should get home as fast as he could.\"\\n\\n\"is not this song worth staying for?\" said anne, suddenly struck\\nby an idea which made her yet more anxious to be encouraging.\\n\\n\"no!\" he replied impressively, \"there is nothing worth my staying for;\"\\nand he was gone directly.\\n\\njealousy of mr elliot!  it was the only intelligible motive.\\ncaptain wentworth jealous of her affection!  could she have believed it\\na week ago; three hours ago!  for a moment the gratification was exquisite.\\nbut, alas! there were very different thoughts to succeed.\\nhow was such jealousy to be quieted?  how was the truth to reach him?\\nhow, in all the peculiar disadvantages of their respective situations,\\nwould he ever learn of her real sentiments?  it was misery to think\\nof mr elliot\\'s attentions.  their evil was incalculable.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 21\\n\\n\\nanne recollected with pleasure the next morning her promise\\nof going to mrs smith, meaning that it should engage her from home\\nat the time when mr elliot would be most likely to call; for to avoid\\nmr elliot was almost a first object.\\n\\nshe felt a great deal of good-will towards him.  in spite of\\nthe mischief of his attentions, she owed him gratitude and regard,\\nperhaps compassion.  she could not help thinking much of the extraordinary\\ncircumstances attending their acquaintance, of the right which\\nhe seemed to have to interest her, by everything in situation,\\nby his own sentiments, by his early prepossession.  it was altogether\\nvery extraordinary; flattering, but painful.  there was much to regret.\\nhow she might have felt had there been no captain wentworth in the case,\\nwas not worth enquiry; for there was a captain wentworth;\\nand be the conclusion of the present suspense good or bad,\\nher affection would be his for ever.  their union, she believed,\\ncould not divide her more from other men, than their final separation.\\n\\nprettier musings of high-wrought love and eternal constancy,\\ncould never have passed along the streets of bath, than anne\\nwas sporting with from camden place to westgate buildings.\\nit was almost enough to spread purification and perfume all the way.\\n\\nshe was sure of a pleasant reception; and her friend seemed this morning\\nparticularly obliged to her for coming, seemed hardly to have expected her,\\nthough it had been an appointment.\\n\\nan account of the concert was immediately claimed; and anne\\'s recollections\\nof the concert were quite happy enough to animate her features\\nand make her rejoice to talk of it.  all that she could tell\\nshe told most gladly, but the all was little for one who had been there,\\nand unsatisfactory for such an enquirer as mrs smith, who had\\nalready heard, through the short cut of a laundress and a waiter,\\nrather more of the general success and produce of the evening\\nthan anne could relate, and who now asked in vain for several particulars\\nof the company.  everybody of any consequence or notoriety in bath\\nwas well know by name to mrs smith.\\n\\n\"the little durands were there, i conclude,\" said she, \"with their mouths\\nopen to catch the music, like unfledged sparrows ready to be fed.\\nthey never miss a concert.\"\\n\\n\"yes; i did not see them myself, but i heard mr elliot say they were\\nin the room.\"\\n\\n\"the ibbotsons, were they there? and the two new beauties,\\nwith the tall irish officer, who is talked of for one of them.\"\\n\\n\"i do not know.  i do not think they were.\"\\n\\n\"old lady mary maclean?  i need not ask after her.  she never misses,\\ni know; and you must have seen her.  she must have been in your own circle;\\nfor as you went with lady dalrymple, you were in the seats of grandeur,\\nround the orchestra, of course.\"\\n\\n\"no, that was what i dreaded.  it would have been very unpleasant to me\\nin every respect.  but happily lady dalrymple always chooses\\nto be farther off; and we were exceedingly well placed, that is,\\nfor hearing; i must not say for seeing, because i appear to have seen\\nvery little.\"\\n\\n\"oh! you saw enough for your own amusement.  i can understand.\\nthere is a sort of domestic enjoyment to be known even in a crowd,\\nand this you had.  you were a large party in yourselves,\\nand you wanted nothing beyond.\"\\n\\n\"but i ought to have looked about me more,\" said anne, conscious\\nwhile she spoke that there had in fact been no want of looking about,\\nthat the object only had been deficient.\\n\\n\"no, no; you were better employed.  you need not tell me that you\\nhad a pleasant evening.  i see it in your eye.  i perfectly see\\nhow the hours passed:  that you had always something agreeable\\nto listen to.  in the intervals of the concert it was conversation.\"\\n\\nanne half smiled and said, \"do you see that in my eye?\"\\n\\n\"yes, i do.  your countenance perfectly informs me that you were\\nin company last night with the person whom you think the most agreeable\\nin the world, the person who interests you at this present time\\nmore than all the rest of the world put together.\"\\n\\na blush overspread anne\\'s cheeks.  she could say nothing.\\n\\n\"and such being the case,\" continued mrs smith, after a short pause,\\n\"i hope you believe that i do know how to value your kindness\\nin coming to me this morning.  it is really very good of you\\nto come and sit with me, when you must have so many pleasanter demands\\nupon your time.\"\\n\\nanne heard nothing of this.  she was still in the astonishment and\\nconfusion excited by her friend\\'s penetration, unable to imagine\\nhow any report of captain wentworth could have reached her.\\nafter another short silence--\\n\\n\"pray,\" said mrs smith, \"is mr elliot aware of your acquaintance with me?\\ndoes he know that i am in bath?\"\\n\\n\"mr elliot!\" repeated anne, looking up surprised.  a moment\\'s reflection\\nshewed her the mistake she had been under.  she caught it instantaneously;\\nand recovering her courage with the feeling of safety, soon added,\\nmore composedly, \"are you acquainted with mr elliot?\"\\n\\n\"i have been a good deal acquainted with him,\" replied mrs smith, gravely,\\n\"but it seems worn out now.  it is a great while since we met.\"\\n\\n\"i was not at all aware of this.  you never mentioned it before.\\nhad i known it, i would have had the pleasure of talking to him about you.\"\\n\\n\"to confess the truth,\" said mrs smith, assuming her usual\\nair of cheerfulness, \"that is exactly the pleasure i want you to have.\\ni want you to talk about me to mr elliot.  i want your interest with him.\\nhe can be of essential service to me; and if you would have the goodness,\\nmy dear miss elliot, to make it an object to yourself,\\nof course it is done.\"\\n\\n\"i should be extremely happy; i hope you cannot doubt my willingness\\nto be of even the slightest use to you,\" replied anne; \"but i suspect\\nthat you are considering me as having a higher claim on mr elliot,\\na greater right to influence him, than is really the case.\\ni am sure you have, somehow or other, imbibed such a notion.\\nyou must consider me only as mr elliot\\'s relation.  if in that light\\nthere is anything which you suppose his cousin might fairly ask of him,\\ni beg you would not hesitate to employ me.\"\\n\\nmrs smith gave her a penetrating glance, and then, smiling, said--\\n\\n\"i have been a little premature, i perceive; i beg your pardon.\\ni ought to have waited for official information,  but now, my dear\\nmiss elliot, as an old friend, do give me a hint as to when i may speak.\\nnext week?  to be sure by next week i may be allowed to\\nthink it all settled, and build my own selfish schemes on\\nmr elliot\\'s good fortune.\"\\n\\n\"no,\" replied anne, \"nor next week, nor next, nor next.\\ni assure you that nothing of the sort you are thinking of\\nwill be settled any week.  i am not going to marry mr elliot.\\ni should like to know why you imagine i am?\"\\n\\nmrs smith looked at her again, looked earnestly, smiled,\\nshook her head, and exclaimed--\\n\\n\"now, how i do wish i understood you!  how i do wish i knew\\nwhat you were at!  i have a great idea that you do not design to be cruel,\\nwhen the right moment occurs.  till it does come, you know,\\nwe women never mean to have anybody.  it is a thing of course among us,\\nthat every man is refused, till he offers.  but why should you be cruel?\\nlet me plead for my--present friend i cannot call him, but for\\nmy former friend.  where can you look for a more suitable match?\\nwhere could you expect a more gentlemanlike, agreeable man?\\nlet me recommend mr elliot.  i am sure you hear nothing but good of him\\nfrom colonel wallis; and who can know him better than colonel wallis?\"\\n\\n\"my dear mrs smith, mr elliot\\'s wife has not been dead much above\\nhalf a year.  he ought not to be supposed to be paying his addresses\\nto any one.\"\\n\\n\"oh! if these are your only objections,\" cried mrs smith, archly,\\n\"mr elliot is safe, and i shall give myself no more trouble about him.\\ndo not forget me when you are married, that\\'s all.  let him know me to be\\na friend of yours, and then he will think little of the trouble required,\\nwhich it is very natural for him now, with so many affairs and engagements\\nof his own, to avoid and get rid of as he can; very natural, perhaps.\\nninety-nine out of a hundred would do the same.  of course,\\nhe cannot be aware of the importance to me.  well, my dear miss elliot,\\ni hope and trust you will be very happy.  mr elliot has sense\\nto understand the value of such a woman.  your peace will not be\\nshipwrecked as mine has been.  you are safe in all worldly matters,\\nand safe in his character.  he will not be led astray; he will not be\\nmisled by others to his ruin.\"\\n\\n\"no,\" said anne, \"i can readily believe all that of my cousin.\\nhe seems to have a calm decided temper, not at all open\\nto dangerous impressions.  i consider him with great respect.\\ni have no reason, from any thing that has fallen within my observation,\\nto do otherwise.  but i have not known him long; and he is not a man,\\ni think, to be known intimately soon.  will not this manner\\nof speaking of him, mrs smith, convince you that he is nothing to me?\\nsurely this must be calm enough.  and, upon my word, he is nothing to me.\\nshould he ever propose to me (which i have very little reason to imagine\\nhe has any thought of doing), i shall not accept him.  i assure you\\ni shall not.  i assure you, mr elliot had not the share which\\nyou have been supposing, in whatever pleasure the concert\\nof last night might afford:  not mr elliot; it is not mr elliot that--\"\\n\\nshe stopped, regretting with a deep blush that she had implied so much;\\nbut less would hardly have been sufficient.  mrs smith would hardly\\nhave believed so soon in mr elliot\\'s failure, but from the perception\\nof there being a somebody else.  as it was, she instantly submitted,\\nand with all the semblance of seeing nothing beyond; and anne,\\neager to escape farther notice, was impatient to know why mrs smith\\nshould have fancied she was to marry mr elliot; where she could have\\nreceived the idea, or from whom she could have heard it.\\n\\n\"do tell me how it first came into your head.\"\\n\\n\"it first came into my head,\" replied mrs smith, \"upon finding how much\\nyou were together, and feeling it to be the most probable thing\\nin the world to be wished for by everybody belonging to either of you;\\nand you may depend upon it that all your acquaintance have disposed of you\\nin the same way.  but i never heard it spoken of till two days ago.\"\\n\\n\"and has it indeed been spoken of?\"\\n\\n\"did you observe the woman who opened the door to you when\\nyou called yesterday?\"\\n\\n\"no.  was not it mrs speed, as usual, or the maid?  i observed\\nno one in particular.\"\\n\\n\"it was my friend mrs rooke; nurse rooke; who, by-the-bye,\\nhad a great curiosity to see you, and was delighted to be in the way\\nto let you in.  she came away from marlborough buildings only on sunday;\\nand she it was who told me you were to marry mr elliot.\\nshe had had it from mrs wallis herself, which did not seem bad authority.\\nshe sat an hour with me on monday evening, and gave me the whole history.\"\\n\"the whole history,\" repeated anne, laughing.  \"she could not make\\na very long history, i think, of one such little article\\nof unfounded news.\"\\n\\nmrs smith said nothing.\\n\\n\"but,\" continued anne, presently, \"though there is no truth in my having\\nthis claim on mr elliot, i should be extremely happy to be of use to you\\nin any way that i could.  shall i mention to him your being in bath?\\nshall i take any message?\"\\n\\n\"no, i thank you:  no, certainly not.  in the warmth of the moment,\\nand under a mistaken impression, i might, perhaps, have endeavoured\\nto interest you in some circumstances; but not now.  no, i thank you,\\ni have nothing to trouble you with.\"\\n\\n\"i think you spoke of having known mr elliot many years?\"\\n\\n\"i did.\"\\n\\n\"not before he was married, i suppose?\"\\n\\n\"yes; he was not married when i knew him first.\"\\n\\n\"and--were you much acquainted?\"\\n\\n\"intimately.\"\\n\\n\"indeed!  then do tell me what he was at that time of life.\\ni have a great curiosity to know what mr elliot was as a very young man.\\nwas he at all such as he appears now?\"\\n\\n\"i have not seen mr elliot these three years,\" was mrs smith\\'s answer,\\ngiven so gravely that it was impossible to pursue the subject farther;\\nand anne felt that she had gained nothing but an increase of curiosity.\\nthey were both silent:  mrs smith very thoughtful.  at last--\\n\\n\"i beg your pardon, my dear miss elliot,\" she cried, in her\\nnatural tone of cordiality, \"i beg your pardon for the short answers\\ni have been giving you, but i have been uncertain what i ought to do.\\ni have been doubting and considering as to what i ought to tell you.\\nthere were many things to be taken into the account.  one hates\\nto be officious, to be giving bad impressions, making mischief.\\neven the smooth surface of family-union seems worth preserving,\\nthough there may be nothing durable beneath.  however, i have determined;\\ni think i am right; i think you ought to be made acquainted\\nwith mr elliot\\'s real character.  though i fully believe that,\\nat present, you have not the smallest intention of accepting him,\\nthere is no saying what may happen.  you might, some time or other,\\nbe differently affected towards him.  hear the truth, therefore,\\nnow, while you are unprejudiced.  mr elliot is a man without heart\\nor conscience; a designing, wary, cold-blooded being, who thinks\\nonly of himself; whom for his own interest or ease, would be guilty\\nof any cruelty, or any treachery, that could be perpetrated without\\nrisk of his general character.  he has no feeling for others.\\nthose whom he has been the chief cause of leading into ruin,\\nhe can neglect and desert without the smallest compunction.\\nhe is totally beyond the reach of any sentiment of justice or compassion.\\noh! he is black at heart, hollow and black!\"\\n\\nanne\\'s astonished air, and exclamation of wonder, made her pause,\\nand in a calmer manner, she added,\\n\\n\"my expressions startle you.  you must allow for an injured, angry woman.\\nbut i will try to command myself.  i will not abuse him.\\ni will only tell you what i have found him.  facts shall speak.\\nhe was the intimate friend of my dear husband, who trusted and loved him,\\nand thought him as good as himself.  the intimacy had been formed\\nbefore our marriage.  i found them most intimate friends; and i, too,\\nbecame excessively pleased with mr elliot, and entertained\\nthe highest opinion of him.  at nineteen, you know, one does not\\nthink very seriously; but mr elliot appeared to me quite as good as others,\\nand much more agreeable than most others, and we were almost\\nalways together.  we were principally in town, living in very good style.\\nhe was then the inferior in circumstances; he was then the poor one;\\nhe had chambers in the temple, and it was as much as he could do\\nto support the appearance of a gentleman.  he had always a home\\nwith us whenever he chose it; he was always welcome; he was like a brother.\\nmy poor charles, who had the finest, most generous spirit in the world,\\nwould have divided his last farthing with him; and i know that his purse\\nwas open to him; i know that he often assisted him.\"\\n\\n\"this must have been about that very period of mr elliot\\'s life,\"\\nsaid anne, \"which has always excited my particular curiosity.\\nit must have been about the same time that he became known to\\nmy father and sister.  i never knew him myself; i only heard of him;\\nbut there was a something in his conduct then, with regard to\\nmy father and sister, and afterwards in the circumstances of his marriage,\\nwhich i never could quite reconcile with present times.  it seemed\\nto announce a different sort of man.\"\\n\\n\"i know it all, i know it all,\" cried mrs smith.  \"he had been\\nintroduced to sir walter and your sister before i was acquainted with him,\\nbut i heard him speak of them for ever.  i know he was invited\\nand encouraged, and i know he did not choose to go.  i can satisfy you,\\nperhaps, on points which you would little expect; and as to his marriage,\\ni knew all about it at the time.  i was privy to all the fors and againsts;\\ni was the friend to whom he confided his hopes and plans; and though\\ni did not know his wife previously, her inferior situation in society,\\nindeed, rendered that impossible, yet i knew her all her life afterwards,\\nor at least till within the last two years of her life, and can answer\\nany question you may wish to put.\"\\n\\n\"nay,\" said anne, \"i have no particular enquiry to make about her.\\ni have always understood they were not a happy couple.  but i should\\nlike to know why, at that time of his life, he should slight\\nmy father\\'s acquaintance as he did.  my father was certainly disposed\\nto take very kind and proper notice of him.  why did mr elliot draw back?\"\\n\\n\"mr elliot,\" replied mrs smith, \"at that period of his life,\\nhad one object in view:  to make his fortune, and by a rather quicker\\nprocess than the law.  he was determined to make it by marriage.\\nhe was determined, at least, not to mar it by an imprudent marriage;\\nand i know it was his belief (whether justly or not, of course\\ni cannot decide), that your father and sister, in their civilities\\nand invitations, were designing a match between the heir\\nand the young lady, and it was impossible that such a match\\nshould have answered his ideas of wealth and independence.\\nthat was his motive for drawing back, i can assure you.\\nhe told me the whole story.  he had no concealments with me.\\nit was curious, that having just left you behind me in bath,\\nmy first and principal acquaintance on marrying should be your cousin;\\nand that, through him, i should be continually hearing of your father\\nand sister.  he described one miss elliot, and i thought\\nvery affectionately of the other.\"\\n\\n\"perhaps,\" cried anne, struck by a sudden idea, \"you sometimes\\nspoke of me to mr elliot?\"\\n\\n\"to be sure i did; very often.  i used to boast of my own anne elliot,\\nand vouch for your being a very different creature from--\"\\n\\nshe checked herself just in time.\\n\\n\"this accounts for something which mr elliot said last night,\"\\ncried anne.  \"this explains it.  i found he had been used to hear of me.\\ni could not comprehend how.  what wild imaginations one forms where\\ndear self is concerned!  how sure to be mistaken!  but i beg your pardon;\\ni have interrupted you.  mr elliot married then completely for money?\\nthe circumstances, probably, which first opened your eyes\\nto his character.\"\\n\\nmrs smith hesitated a little here.  \"oh! those things are too common.\\nwhen one lives in the world, a man or woman\\'s marrying for money\\nis too common to strike one as it ought.  i was very young,\\nand associated only with the young, and we were a thoughtless,\\ngay set, without any strict rules of conduct.  we lived for enjoyment.\\ni think differently now; time and sickness and sorrow have given me\\nother notions; but at that period i must own i saw nothing reprehensible\\nin what mr elliot was doing.  `to do the best for himself,\\'\\npassed as a duty.\"\\n\\n\"but was not she a very low woman?\"\\n\\n\"yes; which i objected to, but he would not regard.  money, money,\\nwas all that he wanted.  her father was a grazier, her grandfather\\nhad been a butcher, but that was all nothing.  she was a fine woman,\\nhad had a decent education, was brought forward by some cousins,\\nthrown by chance into mr elliot\\'s company, and fell in love with him;\\nand not a difficulty or a scruple was there on his side,\\nwith respect to her birth.  all his caution was spent in being secured\\nof the real amount of her fortune, before he committed himself.\\ndepend upon it, whatever esteem mr elliot may have for his own situation\\nin life now, as a young man he had not the smallest value for it.\\nhis chance for the kellynch estate was something, but all the honour\\nof the family he held as cheap as dirt.  i have often heard him declare,\\nthat if baronetcies were saleable, anybody should have his\\nfor fifty pounds, arms and motto, name and livery included;\\nbut i will not pretend to repeat half that i used to hear him say\\non that subject.  it would not be fair; and yet you ought to have proof,\\nfor what is all this but assertion, and you shall have proof.\"\\n\\n\"indeed, my dear mrs smith, i want none,\" cried anne.  \"you have asserted\\nnothing contradictory to what mr elliot appeared to be some years ago.\\nthis is all in confirmation, rather, of what we used to hear and believe.\\ni am more curious to know why he should be so different now.\"\\n\\n\"but for my satisfaction, if you will have the goodness to ring for mary;\\nstay:  i am sure you will have the still greater goodness of\\ngoing yourself into my bedroom, and bringing me the small inlaid box\\nwhich you will find on the upper shelf of the closet.\"\\n\\nanne, seeing her friend to be earnestly bent on it, did as she was desired.\\nthe box was brought and placed before her, and mrs smith, sighing over it\\nas she unlocked it, said--\\n\\n\"this is full of papers belonging to him, to my husband;\\na small portion only of what i had to look over when i lost him.\\nthe letter i am looking for was one written by mr elliot to him\\nbefore our marriage, and happened to be saved; why, one can hardly imagine.\\nbut he was careless and immethodical, like other men, about those things;\\nand when i came to examine his papers, i found it with others\\nstill more trivial, from different people scattered here and there,\\nwhile many letters and memorandums of real importance had been destroyed.\\nhere it is; i would not burn it, because being even then very little\\nsatisfied with mr elliot, i was determined to preserve every document\\nof former intimacy.  i have now another motive for being glad\\nthat i can produce it.\"\\n\\nthis was the letter, directed to \"charles smith, esq. tunbridge wells,\"\\nand dated from london, as far back as july, 1803: --\\n\\n\"dear smith,--i have received yours.  your kindness almost overpowers me.\\ni wish nature had made such hearts as yours more common, but i have\\nlived three-and-twenty years in the world, and have seen none like it.\\nat present, believe me, i have no need of your services,\\nbeing in cash again.  give me joy:  i have got rid of sir walter and miss.\\nthey are gone back to kellynch, and almost made me swear to visit them\\nthis summer; but my first visit to kellynch will be with a surveyor,\\nto tell me how to bring it with best advantage to the hammer.\\nthe baronet, nevertheless, is not unlikely to marry again;\\nhe is quite fool enough.  if he does, however, they will leave me in peace,\\nwhich may be a decent equivalent  for the reversion.  he is worse\\nthan last year.\\n\\n\"i wish i had any name but elliot.  i am sick of it.  the name of walter\\ni can drop, thank god! and i desire you will never insult me\\nwith my second w. again, meaning, for the rest of my life,\\nto be only yours truly,--wm. elliot.\"\\n\\nsuch a letter could not be read without putting anne in a glow;\\nand mrs smith, observing the high colour in her face, said--\\n\\n\"the language, i know, is highly disrespectful.  though i have forgot\\nthe exact terms, i have a perfect impression of the general meaning.\\nbut it shows you the man.  mark his professions to my poor husband.\\ncan any thing be stronger?\"\\n\\nanne could not immediately get over the shock and mortification\\nof finding such words applied to her father.  she was obliged to recollect\\nthat her seeing the letter was a violation of the laws of honour,\\nthat no one ought to be judged or to be known by such testimonies,\\nthat no private correspondence could bear the eye of others,\\nbefore she could recover calmness enough to return the letter\\nwhich she had been meditating over, and say--\\n\\n\"thank you.  this is full proof undoubtedly; proof of every thing\\nyou were saying.  but why be acquainted with us now?\"\\n\\n\"i can explain this too,\" cried mrs smith, smiling.\\n\\n\"can you really?\"\\n\\n\"yes.  i have shewn you mr elliot as he was a dozen years ago,\\nand i will shew him as he is now.  i cannot produce written proof again,\\nbut i can give as authentic oral testimony as you can desire, of what\\nhe is now wanting, and what he is now doing.  he is no hypocrite now.\\nhe truly wants to marry you.  his present attentions to your family\\nare very sincere:  quite from the heart.  i will give you my authority:\\nhis friend colonel wallis.\"\\n\\n\"colonel wallis! you are acquainted with him?\"\\n\\n\"no.  it does not come to me in quite so direct a line as that;\\nit takes a bend or two, but nothing of consequence.  the stream\\nis as good as at first; the little rubbish it collects in the turnings\\nis easily moved away.  mr elliot talks unreservedly to colonel wallis\\nof his views on you, which said colonel wallis, i imagine to be,\\nin himself, a sensible, careful, discerning sort of character;\\nbut colonel wallis has a very pretty silly wife, to whom\\nhe tells things which he had better not, and he repeats it all to her.\\nshe in the overflowing spirits of her recovery, repeats it all\\nto her nurse; and the nurse  knowing my acquaintance with you,\\nvery naturally brings it all to me.  on monday evening, my good friend\\nmrs rooke let me thus much into the secrets of marlborough buildings.\\nwhen i talked of a whole history, therefore, you see i was\\nnot romancing so much as you supposed.\"\\n\\n\"my dear mrs smith, your authority is deficient.  this will not do.\\nmr elliot\\'s having any views on me will not in the least account\\nfor the efforts he made towards a reconciliation with my father.\\nthat was all prior to my coming to bath.  i found them on\\nthe most friendly terms when i arrived.\"\\n\\n\"i know you did; i know it all perfectly, but--\"\\n\\n\"indeed, mrs smith, we must not expect to get real information\\nin such a line.  facts or opinions which are to pass through the hands\\nof so many, to be misconceived by folly in one, and ignorance in another,\\ncan hardly have much truth left.\"\\n\\n\"only give me a hearing.  you will soon be able to judge of\\nthe general credit due, by listening to some particulars\\nwhich you can yourself immediately contradict or confirm.\\nnobody supposes that you were his first inducement.  he had seen you\\nindeed, before he came to bath, and admired you, but without\\nknowing it to be you.  so says my historian, at least.  is this true?\\ndid he see you last summer or autumn, `somewhere down in the west,\\'\\nto use her own words, without knowing it to be you?\"\\n\\n\"he certainly did.  so far it is very true.  at lyme.\\ni happened to be at lyme.\"\\n\\n\"well,\" continued mrs smith, triumphantly, \"grant my friend the credit\\ndue to the establishment of the first point asserted.  he saw you then\\nat lyme, and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleased\\nto meet with you again in camden place, as miss anne elliot,\\nand from that moment, i have no doubt, had a double motive\\nin his visits there.  but there was another, and an earlier,\\nwhich i will now explain.  if there is anything in my story which you know\\nto be either false or improbable, stop me.  my account states,\\nthat your sister\\'s friend, the lady now staying with you,\\nwhom i have heard you mention, came to bath with miss elliot and sir walter\\nas long ago as september (in short when they first came themselves),\\nand has been staying there ever since; that she is a clever, insinuating,\\nhandsome woman, poor and plausible, and altogether such in situation\\nand manner, as to give a general idea, among sir walter\\'s acquaintance,\\nof her meaning to be lady elliot, and as general a surprise\\nthat miss elliot should be apparently, blind to the danger.\"\\n\\nhere mrs smith paused a moment; but anne had not a word to say,\\nand she continued--\\n\\n\"this was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family,\\nlong before you returned to it; and colonel wallis had his eye\\nupon your father enough to be sensible of it, though he did not then\\nvisit in camden place; but his regard for mr elliot gave him an interest\\nin watching all that was going on there, and when mr elliot came to bath\\nfor a day or two, as he happened to do a little before christmas,\\ncolonel wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of things,\\nand the reports beginning to prevail.  now you are to understand,\\nthat time had worked a very material change in mr elliot\\'s opinions\\nas to the value of a baronetcy.  upon all points of blood and connexion\\nhe is a completely altered man.  having long had as much money\\nas he could spend, nothing to wish for on the side of avarice\\nor indulgence, he has been gradually learning to pin his happiness\\nupon the consequence he is heir to.  i thought it coming on\\nbefore our acquaintance ceased, but it is now a confirmed feeling.\\nhe cannot bear the idea of not being sir william.  you may guess,\\ntherefore, that the news he heard from his friend could not be\\nvery agreeable, and you may guess what it produced; the resolution\\nof coming back to bath as soon as possible, and of fixing himself here\\nfor a time, with the view of renewing his former acquaintance,\\nand recovering such a footing in the family as might give him the means\\nof ascertaining the degree of his danger, and of circumventing the lady\\nif he found it material.  this was agreed upon between the two friends\\nas the only thing to be done; and colonel wallis was to assist\\nin every way that he could.  he was to be introduced, and mrs wallis\\nwas to be introduced, and everybody was to be introduced.\\nmr elliot came back accordingly; and on application was forgiven,\\nas you know, and re-admitted into the family; and there it was\\nhis constant object, and his only object (till your arrival\\nadded another motive), to watch sir walter and mrs clay.\\nhe omitted no opportunity of being with them, threw himself in their way,\\ncalled at all hours; but i need not be particular on this subject.\\nyou can imagine what an artful man would do; and with this guide,\\nperhaps, may recollect what you have seen him do.\"\\n\\n\"yes,\" said anne, \"you tell me nothing which does not accord with\\nwhat i have known, or could imagine.  there is always something offensive\\nin the details of cunning.  the manoeuvres of selfishness and duplicity\\nmust ever be revolting, but i have heard nothing which really surprises me.\\ni know those who would be shocked by such a representation of mr elliot,\\nwho would have difficulty in believing it; but i have never been satisfied.\\ni have always wanted some other motive for his conduct than appeared.\\ni should like to know his present opinion, as to the probability\\nof the event he has been in dread of; whether he considers the danger\\nto be lessening or not.\"\\n\\n\"lessening, i understand,\" replied mrs smith.  \"he thinks mrs clay\\nafraid of him, aware that he sees through her, and not daring to proceed\\nas she might do in his absence.  but since he must be absent\\nsome time or other, i do not perceive how he can ever be secure\\nwhile she holds her present influence.  mrs wallis has an amusing idea,\\nas nurse tells me, that it is to be put into the marriage articles\\nwhen you and mr elliot marry, that your father is not to marry mrs clay.\\na scheme, worthy of mrs wallis\\'s understanding, by all accounts;\\nbut my sensible nurse rooke sees the absurdity of it.  `why, to be sure,\\nma\\'am,\\' said she, `it would not prevent his marrying anybody else.\\'\\nand, indeed, to own the truth, i do not think nurse, in her heart,\\nis a very strenuous opposer of sir walter\\'s making a second match.\\nshe must be allowed to be a favourer of matrimony, you know;\\nand (since self will intrude) who can say that she may not have\\nsome flying visions of attending the next lady elliot, through\\nmrs wallis\\'s recommendation?\"\\n\\n\"i am very glad to know all this,\" said anne, after a little\\nthoughtfulness.  \"it will be more painful to me in some respects\\nto be in company with him, but i shall know better what to do.\\nmy line of conduct will be more direct.  mr elliot is evidently\\na disingenuous, artificial, worldly man, who has never had\\nany better principle to guide him than selfishness.\"\\n\\nbut mr elliot was not done with.  mrs smith had been carried away\\nfrom her first direction, and anne had forgotten, in the interest\\nof her own family concerns, how much had been originally implied\\nagainst him; but her attention was now called to the explanation\\nof those first hints, and she listened to a recital which,\\nif it did not perfectly justify the unqualified bitterness of mrs smith,\\nproved him to have been very unfeeling in his conduct towards her;\\nvery deficient both in justice and compassion.\\n\\nshe learned that (the intimacy between them continuing unimpaired\\nby mr elliot\\'s marriage) they had been as before always together,\\nand mr elliot had led his friend into expenses much beyond his fortune.\\nmrs smith did not want to take blame to herself, and was most tender\\nof throwing any on her husband; but anne could collect that their income\\nhad never been equal to their style of living, and that from the first\\nthere had been a great deal of general and joint extravagance.\\nfrom his wife\\'s account of him she could discern mr smith to have been\\na man of warm feelings, easy temper, careless habits, and not strong\\nunderstanding, much more amiable than his friend, and very unlike him,\\nled by him, and probably despised by him.  mr elliot, raised by\\nhis marriage to great affluence, and disposed to every gratification\\nof pleasure and vanity which could be commanded without involving himself,\\n(for with all his self-indulgence he had become a prudent man),\\nand beginning to be rich, just as his friend ought to have found himself\\nto be poor, seemed to have had no concern at all for that friend\\'s\\nprobable finances, but, on the contrary, had been prompting and\\nencouraging expenses which could end only in ruin; and the smiths\\naccordingly had been ruined.\\n\\nthe husband had died just in time to be spared the full knowledge of it.\\nthey had previously known embarrassments enough to try the friendship\\nof their friends, and to prove that mr elliot\\'s had better not be tried;\\nbut it was not till his death that the wretched state of his affairs\\nwas fully known.  with a confidence in mr elliot\\'s regard,\\nmore creditable to his feelings than his judgement, mr smith had\\nappointed him the executor of his will; but mr elliot would not act,\\nand the difficulties and distress which this refusal had heaped on her,\\nin addition to the inevitable sufferings of her situation, had been such\\nas could not be related without anguish of spirit, or listened to\\nwithout corresponding indignation.\\n\\nanne was shewn some letters of his on the occasion, answers to\\nurgent applications from mrs smith, which all breathed the same\\nstern resolution of not engaging in a fruitless trouble, and,\\nunder a cold civility, the same hard-hearted indifference\\nto any of the evils it might bring on her.  it was a dreadful picture\\nof ingratitude and inhumanity; and anne felt, at some moments,\\nthat no flagrant open crime could have been worse.  she had a great deal\\nto listen to; all the particulars of past sad scenes, all the minutiae\\nof distress upon distress, which in former conversations had been\\nmerely hinted at, were dwelt on now with a natural indulgence.\\nanne could perfectly comprehend the exquisite relief, and was only\\nthe more inclined to wonder at the composure of her friend\\'s\\nusual state of mind.\\n\\nthere was one circumstance in the history of her grievances\\nof particular irritation.  she had good reason to believe that\\nsome property of her husband in the west indies, which had been\\nfor many years under a sort of sequestration for the payment\\nof its own incumbrances, might be recoverable by proper measures;\\nand this property, though not large, would be enough to make\\nher comparatively rich.  but there was nobody to stir in it.\\nmr elliot would do nothing, and she could do nothing herself,\\nequally disabled from personal exertion by her state of\\nbodily weakness, and from employing others by her want of money.\\nshe had no natural connexions to assist her even with their counsel,\\nand she could not afford to purchase the assistance of the law.\\nthis was a cruel aggravation of actually straitened means.\\nto feel that she ought to be in better circumstances,\\nthat a little trouble in the right place might do it,\\nand to fear that delay might be even weakening her claims,\\nwas hard to bear.\\n\\nit was on this point that she had hoped to engage anne\\'s good offices\\nwith mr elliot.  she had previously, in the anticipation\\nof their marriage, been very apprehensive of losing her friend by it;\\nbut on being assured that he could have made no attempt of that nature,\\nsince he did not even know her to be in bath, it immediately occurred,\\nthat something might be done in her favour by the influence of the woman\\nhe loved, and she had been hastily preparing to interest anne\\'s feelings,\\nas far as the observances due to mr elliot\\'s character would allow,\\nwhen anne\\'s refutation of the supposed engagement changed\\nthe face of everything; and while it took from her the new-formed hope\\nof succeeding in the object of her first anxiety, left her at least\\nthe comfort of telling the whole story her own way.\\n\\nafter listening to this full description of mr elliot, anne could not but\\nexpress some surprise at mrs smith\\'s having spoken of him so favourably\\nin the beginning of their conversation.  \"she had seemed to recommend\\nand praise him!\"\\n\\n\"my dear,\" was mrs smith\\'s reply, \"there was nothing else to be done.\\ni considered your marrying him as certain, though he might not yet\\nhave made the offer, and i could no more speak the truth of him,\\nthan if he had been your husband.  my heart bled for you,\\nas i talked of happiness; and yet he is sensible, he is agreeable,\\nand with such a woman as you, it was not absolutely hopeless.\\nhe was very unkind to his first wife.  they were wretched together.\\nbut she was too ignorant and giddy for respect, and he had never loved her.\\ni was willing to hope that you must fare better.\"\\n\\nanne could just acknowledge within herself such a possibility\\nof having been induced to marry him, as made her shudder at the idea\\nof the misery which must have followed.  it was just possible that\\nshe might have been persuaded by lady russell!  and under such\\na supposition, which would have been most miserable, when time had\\ndisclosed all, too late?\\n\\nit was very desirable that lady russell should be no longer deceived;\\nand one of the concluding arrangements of this important conference,\\nwhich carried them through the greater part of the morning,\\nwas, that anne had full liberty to communicate to her friend\\neverything relative to mrs smith, in which his conduct was involved.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 22\\n\\n\\nanne went home to think over all that she had heard.  in one point,\\nher feelings were relieved by this knowledge of mr elliot.\\nthere was no longer anything of tenderness due to him.  he stood as\\nopposed to captain wentworth, in all his own unwelcome obtrusiveness;\\nand the evil of his attentions last night, the irremediable mischief\\nhe might have done, was considered with sensations unqualified, unperplexed.\\npity for him was all over.  but this was the only point of relief.\\nin every other respect, in looking around her, or penetrating forward,\\nshe saw more to distrust and to apprehend.  she was concerned\\nfor the disappointment and pain lady russell would be feeling;\\nfor the mortifications which must be hanging over her father and sister,\\nand had all the distress of foreseeing many evils, without knowing\\nhow to avert any one of them.  she was most thankful for her own\\nknowledge of him.  she had never considered herself as entitled to reward\\nfor not slighting an old friend like mrs smith, but here was\\na reward indeed springing from it!  mrs smith had been able to tell her\\nwhat no one else could have done.  could the knowledge have\\nbeen extended through her family?  but this was a vain idea.\\nshe must talk to lady russell, tell her, consult with her,\\nand having done her best, wait the event with as much composure\\nas possible; and after all, her greatest want of composure would be\\nin that quarter of the mind which could not be opened to lady russell;\\nin that flow of anxieties and fears which must be all to herself.\\n\\n\\nshe found, on reaching home, that she had, as she intended,\\nescaped seeing mr elliot; that he had called and paid them\\na long morning visit; but hardly had she congratulated herself,\\nand felt safe, when she heard that he was coming again in the evening.\\n\\n\"i had not the smallest intention of asking him,\" said elizabeth,\\nwith affected carelessness, \"but he gave so many hints;\\nso mrs clay says, at least.\"\\n\\n\"indeed, i do say it.  i never saw anybody in my life spell harder\\nfor an invitation.  poor man!  i was really in pain for him;\\nfor your hard-hearted sister, miss anne, seems bent on cruelty.\"\\n\\n\"oh!\" cried elizabeth, \"i have been rather too much used to the game\\nto be soon overcome by a gentleman\\'s hints.  however, when i found\\nhow excessively he was regretting that he should miss my father\\nthis morning, i gave way immediately, for i would never really omit\\nan opportunity of bring him and sir walter together.  they appear to\\nso much advantage in company with each other.  each behaving so pleasantly.\\nmr elliot looking up with so much respect.\"\\n\\n\"quite delightful!\" cried mrs clay, not daring, however,\\nto turn her eyes towards anne.  \"exactly like father and son!\\ndear miss elliot, may i not say father and son?\"\\n\\n\"oh! i lay no embargo on any body\\'s words.  if you will have such\\nideas!  but, upon my word, i am scarcely sensible of his attentions\\nbeing beyond those of other men.\"\\n\\n\"my dear miss elliot!\" exclaimed mrs clay, lifting her hands and eyes,\\nand sinking all the rest of her astonishment in a convenient silence.\\n\\n\"well, my dear penelope, you need not be so alarmed about him.\\ni did invite him, you know.  i sent him away with smiles.\\nwhen i found he was really going to his friends at thornberry park\\nfor the whole day to-morrow, i had compassion on him.\"\\n\\nanne admired the good acting of the friend, in being able to shew\\nsuch pleasure as she did, in the expectation and in the actual arrival\\nof the very person whose presence must really be interfering with\\nher prime object.  it was impossible but that mrs clay must hate\\nthe sight of mr elliot; and yet she could assume a most obliging,\\nplacid look, and appear quite satisfied with the curtailed license\\nof devoting herself only half as much to sir walter as she would have\\ndone otherwise.\\n\\nto anne herself it was most distressing to see mr elliot enter the room;\\nand quite painful to have him approach and speak to her.\\nshe had been used before to feel that he could not be always quite sincere,\\nbut now she saw insincerity in everything.  his attentive deference\\nto her father, contrasted with his former language, was odious;\\nand when she thought of his cruel conduct towards mrs smith,\\nshe could hardly bear the sight of his present smiles and mildness,\\nor the sound of his artificial good sentiments.\\n\\nshe meant to avoid any such alteration of manners as might provoke\\na remonstrance on his side.  it was a great object to her to escape\\nall enquiry or eclat; but it was her intention to be as decidedly cool\\nto him as might be compatible with their relationship; and to retrace,\\nas quietly as she could, the few steps of unnecessary intimacy she had\\nbeen gradually led along.  she was accordingly more guarded,\\nand more cool, than she had been the night before.\\n\\nhe wanted to animate her curiosity again as to how and where\\nhe could have heard her formerly praised; wanted very much\\nto be gratified by more solicitation; but the charm was broken:\\nhe found that the heat and animation of a public room was necessary\\nto kindle his modest cousin\\'s vanity; he found, at least, that it was\\nnot to be done now, by any of those attempts which he could hazard\\namong the too-commanding claims of the others.  he little surmised\\nthat it was a subject acting now exactly against his interest,\\nbringing immediately to her thoughts all those parts of his conduct\\nwhich were least excusable.\\n\\nshe had some satisfaction in finding that he was really going out of bath\\nthe next morning, going early, and that he would be gone the greater part\\nof two days.  he was invited again to camden place the very evening of\\nhis return; but from thursday to saturday evening his absence was certain.\\nit was bad enough that a mrs clay should be always before her;\\nbut that a deeper hypocrite should be added to their party,\\nseemed the destruction of everything like peace and comfort.\\nit was so humiliating to reflect on the constant deception practised\\non her father and elizabeth; to consider the various sources\\nof mortification preparing for them!  mrs clay\\'s selfishness was\\nnot so complicate nor so revolting as his; and anne would have compounded\\nfor the marriage at once, with all its evils, to be clear of mr elliot\\'s\\nsubtleties in endeavouring to prevent it.\\n\\non friday morning she meant to go very early to lady russell,\\nand accomplish the necessary communication; and she would have gone\\ndirectly after breakfast, but that mrs clay was also going out\\non some obliging purpose of saving her sister trouble, which\\ndetermined her to wait till she might be safe from such a companion.\\nshe saw mrs clay fairly off, therefore, before she began to talk\\nof spending the morning in rivers street.\\n\\n\"very well,\" said elizabeth, \"i have nothing to send but my love.\\noh! you may as well take back that tiresome book she would lend me,\\nand pretend i have read it through.  i really cannot be plaguing myself\\nfor ever with all the new poems and states of the nation that come out.\\nlady russell quite bores one with her new publications.\\nyou need not tell her so, but i thought her dress hideous the other night.\\ni used to think she had some taste in dress, but i was ashamed of her\\nat the concert.  something so formal and arrange in her air!\\nand she sits so upright!  my best love, of course.\"\\n\\n\"and mine,\" added sir walter.  \"kindest regards.  and you may say,\\nthat i mean to call upon her soon.  make a civil message;\\nbut i shall only leave my card.  morning visits are never fair\\nby women at her time of life, who make themselves up so little.\\nif she would only wear rouge she would not be afraid of being seen;\\nbut last time i called, i observed the blinds were let down immediately.\"\\n\\nwhile her father spoke, there was a knock at the door.  who could it be?\\nanne, remembering the preconcerted visits, at all hours, of mr elliot,\\nwould have expected him, but for his known engagement seven miles off.\\nafter the usual period of suspense, the usual sounds of approach were heard,\\nand \"mr and mrs charles musgrove\" were ushered into the room.\\n\\nsurprise was the strongest emotion raised by their appearance;\\nbut anne was really glad to see them; and the others were not so sorry\\nbut that they could put on a decent air of welcome; and as soon\\nas it became clear that these, their nearest relations, were not arrived\\nwith an views of accommodation in that house, sir walter and elizabeth\\nwere able to rise in cordiality, and do the honours of it very well.\\nthey were come to bath for a few days with mrs musgrove, and were\\nat the white hart.  so much was pretty soon understood;\\nbut till sir walter and elizabeth were walking mary into\\nthe other drawing-room, and regaling themselves with her admiration,\\nanne could not draw upon charles\\'s brain for a regular history\\nof their coming, or an explanation of some smiling hints\\nof particular business, which had been ostentatiously dropped by mary,\\nas well as of some apparent confusion as to whom their party consisted of.\\n\\nshe then found that it consisted of mrs musgrove, henrietta,\\nand captain harville, beside their two selves.  he gave her a very plain,\\nintelligible account of the whole; a narration in which she saw\\na great deal of most characteristic proceeding.  the scheme\\nhad received its first impulse by captain harville\\'s wanting to\\ncome to bath on business.  he had begun to talk of it a week ago;\\nand by way of doing something, as shooting was over, charles had proposed\\ncoming with him, and mrs harville had seemed to like the idea of it\\nvery much, as an advantage to her husband; but mary could not bear\\nto be left, and had made herself so unhappy about it, that for a day or two\\neverything seemed to be in suspense, or at an end.  but then,\\nit had been taken up by his father and mother.  his mother had\\nsome old friends in bath whom she wanted to see; it was thought\\na good opportunity for henrietta to come and buy wedding-clothes\\nfor herself and her sister; and, in short, it ended in being\\nhis mother\\'s party, that everything might be comfortable and easy\\nto captain harville; and he and mary were included in it\\nby way of general convenience.  they had arrived late the night before.\\nmrs harville, her children, and captain benwick, remained with\\nmr musgrove and louisa at uppercross.\\n\\nanne\\'s only surprise was, that affairs should be in forwardness enough\\nfor henrietta\\'s wedding-clothes to be talked of.  she had imagined\\nsuch difficulties of fortune to exist there as must prevent\\nthe marriage from being near at hand; but she learned from charles that,\\nvery recently, (since mary\\'s last letter to herself), charles hayter\\nhad been applied to by a friend to hold a living for a youth\\nwho could not possibly claim it under many years; and that\\non the strength of his present income, with almost a certainty\\nof something more permanent long before the term in question,\\nthe two families had consented to the young people\\'s wishes,\\nand that their marriage was likely to take place in a few months,\\nquite as soon as louisa\\'s.  \"and a very good living it was,\"\\ncharles added:  \"only five-and-twenty miles from uppercross,\\nand in a very fine country:   fine part of dorsetshire.\\nin the centre of some of the best preserves in the kingdom,\\nsurrounded by three great proprietors, each more careful and jealous\\nthan the other; and to two of the three at least, charles hayter might get\\na special recommendation.  not that he will value it as he ought,\"\\nhe observed, \"charles is too cool about sporting. that\\'s the worst of him.\"\\n\\n\"i am extremely glad, indeed,\" cried anne, \"particularly glad\\nthat this should happen; and that of two sisters, who both deserve\\nequally well, and who have always been such good friends,\\nthe pleasant prospect of one should not be dimming those of the other--\\nthat they should be so equal in their prosperity and comfort.\\ni hope your father and mother are quite happy with regard to both.\"\\n\\n\"oh! yes.  my father would be well pleased if the gentlemen were richer,\\nbut he has no other fault to find.  money, you know, coming down with\\nmoney--two daughters at once--it cannot be a very agreeable operation,\\nand it streightens him as to many things.  however, i do not mean to say\\nthey have not a right to it.  it is very fit they should have\\ndaughters\\' shares; and i am sure he has always been a very kind,\\nliberal father to me.  mary does not above half like henrietta\\'s match.\\nshe never did, you know.  but she does not do him justice,\\nnor think enough about winthrop.  i cannot make her attend to\\nthe value of the property.  it is a very fair match, as times go;\\nand i have liked charles hayter all my life, and i shall not leave off now.\"\\n\\n\"such excellent parents as mr and mrs musgrove,\" exclaimed anne,\\n\"should be happy in their children\\'s marriages.  they do everything\\nto confer happiness, i am sure.  what a blessing to young people\\nto be in such hands!  your father and mother seem so totally free\\nfrom all those ambitious feelings which have led to so much misconduct\\nand misery, both in young and old.  i hope you think louisa\\nperfectly recovered now?\"\\n\\nhe answered rather hesitatingly, \"yes, i believe i do; very much recovered;\\nbut she is altered; there is no running or jumping about, no laughing\\nor dancing; it is quite different.  if one happens only to shut the door\\na little hard, she starts and wriggles like a young dab-chick in the water;\\nand benwick sits at her elbow, reading verses, or whispering to her,\\nall day long.\"\\n\\nanne could not help laughing.  \"that cannot be much to your taste,\\ni know,\" said she; \"but i do believe him to be an excellent young man.\"\\n\\n\"to be sure he is.  nobody doubts it; and i hope you do not think\\ni am so illiberal as to want every man to have the same objects and\\npleasures as myself.  i have a great value for benwick; and when one can\\nbut get him to talk, he has plenty to say.  his reading has done him\\nno harm, for he has fought as well as read.  he is a brave fellow.\\ni got more acquainted with him last monday than ever i did before.\\nwe had a famous set-to at rat-hunting all the morning in\\nmy father\\'s great barns; and he played his part so well\\nthat i have liked him the better ever since.\"\\n\\nhere they were interrupted by the absolute necessity of charles\\'s\\nfollowing the others to admire mirrors and china; but anne had\\nheard enough to understand the present state of uppercross,\\nand rejoice in its happiness; and though she sighed as she rejoiced,\\nher sigh had none of the ill-will of envy in it.  she would certainly\\nhave risen to their blessings if she could, but she did not want\\nto lessen theirs.\\n\\nthe visit passed off altogether in high good humour.  mary was\\nin excellent spirits, enjoying the gaiety and the change,\\nand so well satisfied with the journey in her mother-in-law\\'s carriage\\nwith four horses, and with her own complete independence of camden place,\\nthat she was exactly in a temper to admire everything as she ought,\\nand enter most readily into all the superiorities of the house,\\nas they were detailed to her.  she had no demands on her father or sister,\\nand her consequence was just enough increased by their handsome\\ndrawing-rooms.\\n\\nelizabeth was, for a short time, suffering a good deal.\\nshe felt that mrs musgrove and all her party ought to be asked\\nto dine with them; but she could not bear to have the difference of style,\\nthe reduction of servants, which a dinner must betray, witnessed by those\\nwho had been always so inferior to the elliots of kellynch.\\nit was a struggle between propriety and vanity; but vanity got the better,\\nand then elizabeth was happy again.  these were her internal persuasions:\\n\"old fashioned notions; country hospitality; we do not profess\\nto give dinners; few people in bath do; lady alicia never does;\\ndid not even ask her own sister\\'s family, though they were here a month:\\nand i dare say it would be very inconvenient to mrs musgrove;\\nput her quite out of her way.  i am sure she would rather not come;\\nshe cannot feel easy with us.  i will ask them all for an evening;\\nthat will be much better; that will be a novelty and a treat.\\nthey have not seen two such drawing rooms before.  they will be delighted\\nto come to-morrow evening.  it shall be a regular party, small,\\nbut most elegant.\"  and this satisfied elizabeth:  and when the invitation\\nwas given to the two present, and promised for the absent,\\nmary was as completely satisfied.  she was particularly asked\\nto meet mr elliot, and be introduced to lady dalrymple and miss carteret,\\nwho were fortunately already engaged to come; and she could not\\nhave received a more gratifying attention.  miss elliot was to have\\nthe honour of calling on mrs musgrove in the course of the morning;\\nand anne walked off with charles and mary, to go and see her\\nand henrietta directly.\\n\\nher plan of sitting with lady russell must give way for the present.\\nthey all three called in rivers street for a couple of minutes;\\nbut anne convinced herself that a day\\'s delay of the intended communication\\ncould be of no consequence, and hastened forward to the white hart,\\nto see again the friends and companions of the last autumn,\\nwith an eagerness of good-will which many associations contributed to form.\\n\\nthey found mrs musgrove and her daughter within, and by themselves,\\nand anne had the kindest welcome from each.  henrietta was exactly\\nin that state of recently-improved views, of fresh-formed happiness,\\nwhich made her full of regard and interest for everybody she had\\never liked before at all; and mrs musgrove\\'s real affection had been won\\nby her usefulness when they were in distress.  it was a heartiness,\\nand a warmth, and a sincerity which anne delighted in the more,\\nfrom the sad want of such blessings at home.  she was entreated\\nto give them as much of her time as possible, invited for every day\\nand all day long, or rather claimed as part of the family; and, in return,\\nshe naturally fell into all her wonted ways of attention and assistance,\\nand on charles\\'s leaving them together, was listening to mrs musgrove\\'s\\nhistory of louisa, and to henrietta\\'s of herself, giving opinions\\non business, and recommendations to shops; with intervals of every help\\nwhich mary required, from altering her ribbon to settling her accounts;\\nfrom finding her keys, and assorting her trinkets, to trying\\nto convince her that she was not ill-used by anybody; which mary,\\nwell amused as she generally was, in her station at a window\\noverlooking the entrance to the pump room, could not but have\\nher moments of imagining.\\n\\na morning of thorough confusion was to be expected.  a large party\\nin an hotel ensured a quick-changing, unsettled scene.  one five minutes\\nbrought a note, the next a parcel; and anne had not been there\\nhalf an hour, when their dining-room, spacious as it was,\\nseemed more than half filled:  a party of steady old friends\\nwere seated around mrs musgrove, and charles came back with\\ncaptains harville and wentworth.  the appearance of the latter\\ncould not be more than the surprise of the moment.  it was impossible\\nfor her to have forgotten to feel that this arrival of their\\ncommon friends must be soon bringing them together again.\\ntheir last meeting had been most important in opening his feelings;\\nshe had derived from it a delightful conviction; but she feared\\nfrom his looks, that the same unfortunate persuasion, which had\\nhastened him away from the concert room, still governed.\\nhe did not seem to want to be near enough for conversation.\\n\\nshe tried to be calm, and leave things to take their course,\\nand tried to dwell much on this argument of rational dependence:--\\n\"surely, if there be constant attachment on each side, our hearts\\nmust understand each other ere long.  we are not boy and girl,\\nto be captiously irritable, misled by every moment\\'s inadvertence,\\nand wantonly playing with our own happiness.\"  and yet,\\na few minutes afterwards, she felt as if their being in company\\nwith each other, under their present circumstances, could only be\\nexposing them to inadvertencies and misconstructions of the most\\nmischievous kind.\\n\\n\"anne,\" cried mary, still at her window, \"there is mrs clay,\\ni am sure, standing under the colonnade, and a gentleman with her.\\ni saw them turn the corner from bath street just now.  they seemed\\ndeep in talk.  who is it?  come, and tell me.  good heavens! i recollect.\\nit is mr elliot himself.\"\\n\\n\"no,\" cried anne, quickly, \"it cannot be mr elliot, i assure you.\\nhe was to leave bath at nine this morning, and does not come back\\ntill to-morrow.\"\\n\\nas she spoke, she felt that captain wentworth was looking at her,\\nthe consciousness of which vexed and embarrassed her, and made her regret\\nthat she had said so much, simple as it was.\\n\\nmary, resenting that she should be supposed not to know her own cousin,\\nbegan talking very warmly about the family features, and protesting\\nstill more positively that it was mr elliot, calling again upon anne\\nto come and look for herself, but anne did not mean to stir,\\nand tried to be cool and unconcerned.  her distress returned,\\nhowever, on perceiving smiles and intelligent glances pass between\\ntwo or three of the lady visitors, as if they believed themselves\\nquite in the secret.  it was evident that the report concerning her\\nhad spread, and a short pause succeeded, which seemed to ensure\\nthat it would now spread farther.\\n\\n\"do come, anne\" cried mary, \"come and look yourself.  you will be too late\\nif you do not make haste.  they are parting; they are shaking hands.\\nhe is turning away.  not know mr elliot, indeed!  you seem to have\\nforgot all about lyme.\"\\n\\nto pacify mary, and perhaps screen her own embarrassment,\\nanne did move quietly to the window.  she was just in time to ascertain\\nthat it really was mr elliot, which she had never believed,\\nbefore he disappeared on one side, as mrs clay walked quickly off\\non the other; and checking the surprise which she could not but feel\\nat such an appearance of friendly conference between two persons\\nof totally opposite interest, she calmly said, \"yes, it is mr elliot,\\ncertainly.  he has changed his hour of going, i suppose, that is all,\\nor i may be mistaken, i might not attend;\" and walked back to her chair,\\nrecomposed, and with the comfortable hope of having acquitted herself well.\\n\\nthe visitors took their leave; and charles, having civilly seen them off,\\nand then made a face at them, and abused them for coming, began with--\\n\\n\"well, mother, i have done something for you that you will like.\\ni have been to the theatre, and secured a box for to-morrow night.\\na\\'n\\'t i a good boy?  i know you love a play; and there is room for us all.\\nit holds nine.  i have engaged captain wentworth.  anne will\\nnot be sorry to join us, i am sure.  we all like a play.\\nhave not i done well, mother?\"\\n\\nmrs musgrove was good humouredly beginning to express her perfect readiness\\nfor the play, if henrietta and all the others liked it, when mary\\neagerly interrupted her by exclaiming--\\n\\n\"good heavens, charles! how can you think of such a thing?\\ntake a box for to-morrow night!  have you forgot that we are engaged\\nto camden place to-morrow night? and that we were most particularly asked\\nto meet lady dalrymple and her daughter, and mr elliot, and all\\nthe principal family connexions, on purpose to be introduced to them?\\nhow can you be so forgetful?\"\\n\\n\"phoo! phoo!\" replied charles, \"what\\'s an evening party?\\nnever worth remembering.  your father might have asked us to dinner,\\ni think, if he had wanted to see us.  you may do as you like,\\nbut i shall go to the play.\"\\n\\n\"oh! charles, i declare it will be too abominable if you do,\\nwhen you promised to go.\"\\n\\n\"no, i did not promise.  i only smirked and bowed, and said the word\\n`happy.\\'  there was no promise.\"\\n\\n\"but you must go, charles.  it would be unpardonable to fail.\\nwe were asked on purpose to be introduced.  there was always\\nsuch a great connexion between the dalrymples and ourselves.\\nnothing ever happened on either side that was not announced immediately.\\nwe are quite near relations, you know; and mr elliot too,\\nwhom you ought so particularly to be acquainted with!  every attention\\nis due to mr elliot.  consider, my father\\'s heir:  the future\\nrepresentative of the family.\"\\n\\n\"don\\'t talk to me about heirs and representatives,\" cried charles.\\n\"i am not one of those who neglect the reigning power to bow\\nto the rising sun.  if i would not go for the sake of your father,\\ni should think it scandalous to go for the sake of his heir.\\nwhat is mr elliot to me?\"  the careless expression was life to anne,\\nwho saw that captain wentworth was all attention, looking and\\nlistening with his whole soul; and that the last words brought\\nhis enquiring eyes from charles to herself.\\n\\ncharles and mary still talked on in the same style; he, half serious\\nand half jesting, maintaining the scheme for the play, and she,\\ninvariably serious, most warmly opposing it, and not omitting\\nto make it known that, however determined to go to camden place herself,\\nshe should not think herself very well used, if they went to the play\\nwithout her.  mrs musgrove interposed.\\n\\n\"we had better put it off.  charles, you had much better go back\\nand change the box for tuesday.  it would be a pity to be divided,\\nand we should be losing miss anne, too, if there is a party at her father\\'s;\\nand i am sure neither henrietta nor i should care at all for the play,\\nif miss anne could not be with us.\"\\n\\nanne felt truly obliged to her for such kindness; and quite as much\\nso for the opportunity it gave her of decidedly saying--\\n\\n\"if it depended only on my inclination, ma\\'am, the party at home\\n(excepting on mary\\'s account) would not be the smallest impediment.\\ni have no pleasure in the sort of meeting, and should be too happy\\nto change it for a play, and with you.  but, it had better\\nnot be attempted, perhaps.\"  she had spoken it; but she trembled\\nwhen it was done, conscious that her words were listened to,\\nand daring not even to try to observe their effect.\\n\\nit was soon generally agreed that tuesday should be the day;\\ncharles only reserving the advantage of still teasing his wife,\\nby persisting that he would go to the play to-morrow if nobody else would.\\n\\ncaptain wentworth left his seat, and walked to the fire-place;\\nprobably for the sake of walking away from it soon afterwards,\\nand taking a station, with less bare-faced design, by anne.\\n\\n\"you have not been long enough in bath,\" said he, \"to enjoy\\nthe evening parties of the place.\"\\n\\n\"oh! no.  the usual character of them has nothing for me.\\ni am no card-player.\"\\n\\n\"you were not formerly, i know.  you did not use to like cards;\\nbut time makes many changes.\"\\n\\n\"i am not yet so much changed,\" cried anne, and stopped, fearing she\\nhardly knew what misconstruction.  after waiting a few moments\\nhe said, and as if it were the result of immediate feeling,\\n\"it is a period, indeed!  eight years and a half is a period.\"\\n\\nwhether he would have proceeded farther was left to anne\\'s imagination\\nto ponder over in a calmer hour; for while still hearing the sounds\\nhe had uttered, she was startled to other subjects by henrietta,\\neager to make use of the present leisure for getting out,\\nand calling on her companions to lose no time, lest somebody else\\nshould come in.\\n\\nthey were obliged to move.  anne talked of being perfectly ready,\\nand tried to look it; but she felt that could henrietta have known\\nthe regret and reluctance of her heart in quitting that chair,\\nin preparing to quit the room, she would have found, in all her own\\nsensations for her cousin, in the very security of his affection,\\nwherewith to pity her.\\n\\ntheir preparations, however, were stopped short.  alarming sounds\\nwere heard; other visitors approached, and the door was thrown open\\nfor sir walter and miss elliot, whose entrance seemed to give\\na general chill.  anne felt an instant oppression, and wherever she looked\\nsaw symptoms of the same.  the comfort, the freedom, the gaiety\\nof the room was over, hushed into cold composure, determined silence,\\nor insipid talk, to meet the heartless elegance of her father and sister.\\nhow mortifying to feel that it was so!\\n\\nher jealous eye was satisfied in one particular.  captain wentworth\\nwas acknowledged again by each, by elizabeth more graciously than before.\\nshe even addressed him once, and looked at him more than once.\\nelizabeth was, in fact, revolving a great measure.  the sequel\\nexplained it.  after the waste of a few minutes in saying\\nthe proper nothings, she began to give the invitation which\\nwas to comprise all the remaining dues of the musgroves.\\n\"to-morrow evening, to meet a few friends:  no formal party.\"\\nit was all said very gracefully, and the cards with which she had\\nprovided herself, the \"miss elliot at home,\" were laid on the table,\\nwith a courteous, comprehensive smile to all, and one smile and\\none card more decidedly for captain wentworth.  the truth was,\\nthat elizabeth had been long enough in bath to understand\\nthe importance of a man of such an air and appearance as his.\\nthe past was nothing.  the present was that captain wentworth\\nwould move about well in her drawing-room.  the card was pointedly given,\\nand sir walter and elizabeth arose and disappeared.\\n\\nthe interruption had been short, though severe, and ease and animation\\nreturned to most of those they left as the door shut them out,\\nbut not to anne.  she could think only of the invitation she had\\nwith such astonishment witnessed, and of the manner in which\\nit had been received; a manner of doubtful meaning, of surprise rather\\nthan gratification, of polite acknowledgement rather than acceptance.\\nshe knew him; she saw disdain in his eye, and could not venture to believe\\nthat he had determined to accept such an offering, as an atonement\\nfor all the insolence of the past.  her spirits sank.  he held the card\\nin his hand after they were gone, as if deeply considering it.\\n\\n\"only think of elizabeth\\'s including everybody!\" whispered mary\\nvery audibly.  \"i do not wonder captain wentworth is delighted!\\nyou see he cannot put the card out of his hand.\"\\n\\nanne caught his eye, saw his cheeks glow, and his mouth form itself\\ninto a momentary expression of contempt, and turned away,\\nthat she might neither see nor hear more to vex her.\\n\\nthe party separated.  the gentlemen had their own pursuits,\\nthe ladies proceeded on their own business, and they met no more while\\nanne belonged to them.  she was earnestly begged to return and dine,\\nand give them all the rest of the day, but her spirits had been\\nso long exerted that at present she felt unequal to more,\\nand fit only for home, where she might be sure of being as silent\\nas she chose.\\n\\npromising to be with them the whole of the following morning, therefore,\\nshe closed the fatigues of the present by a toilsome walk to camden place,\\nthere to spend the evening chiefly in listening to the busy arrangements\\nof elizabeth and mrs clay for the morrow\\'s party, the frequent enumeration\\nof the persons invited, and the continually improving detail of all\\nthe embellishments which were to make it the most completely elegant\\nof its kind in bath, while harassing herself with the never-ending\\nquestion, of whether captain wentworth would come or not?  they were\\nreckoning him as certain, but with her it was a gnawing solicitude\\nnever appeased for five minutes together.  she generally thought\\nhe would come, because she generally thought he ought; but it was a case\\nwhich she could not so shape into any positive act of duty or discretion,\\nas inevitably to defy the suggestions of very opposite feelings.\\n\\nshe only roused herself from the broodings of this restless agitation,\\nto let mrs clay know that she had been seen with mr elliot\\nthree hours after his being supposed to be out of bath,\\nfor having watched in vain for some intimation of the interview\\nfrom the lady herself, she determined to mention it, and it seemed to her\\nthere was guilt in mrs clay\\'s face as she listened.  it was transient:\\ncleared away in an instant; but anne could imagine she read there\\nthe consciousness of having, by some complication of mutual trick,\\nor some overbearing authority of his, been obliged to attend\\n(perhaps for half an hour) to his lectures and restrictions on her designs\\non sir walter.  she exclaimed, however, with a very tolerable\\nimitation of nature: --\\n\\n\"oh! dear! very true.  only think, miss elliot, to my great surprise\\ni met with mr elliot in bath street.  i was never more astonished.\\nhe turned back and walked with me to the pump yard.  he had been prevented\\nsetting off for thornberry, but i really forget by what;\\nfor i was in a hurry, and could not much attend, and i can only answer\\nfor his being determined not to be delayed in his return.\\nhe wanted to know how early he might be admitted to-morrow.\\nhe was full of `to-morrow,\\' and it is very evident that i have been\\nfull of it too, ever since i entered the house, and learnt the extension\\nof your plan and all that had happened, or my seeing him could never have\\ngone so entirely out of my head.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 23\\n\\n\\none day only had passed since anne\\'s conversation with mrs smith;\\nbut a keener interest had succeeded, and she was now so little touched\\nby mr elliot\\'s conduct, except by its effects in one quarter,\\nthat it became a matter of course the next morning, still to defer\\nher explanatory visit in rivers street.  she had promised to be\\nwith the musgroves from breakfast to dinner.  her faith was plighted,\\nand mr elliot\\'s character, like the sultaness scheherazade\\'s head,\\nmust live another day.\\n\\nshe could not keep her appointment punctually, however;\\nthe weather was unfavourable, and she had grieved over the rain\\non her friends\\' account, and felt it very much on her own,\\nbefore she was able to attempt the walk.  when she reached the white hart,\\nand made her way to the proper apartment, she found herself\\nneither arriving quite in time, nor the first to arrive.\\nthe party before her were, mrs musgrove, talking to mrs croft,\\nand captain harville to captain wentworth; and she immediately heard\\nthat mary and henrietta, too impatient to wait, had gone out the moment\\nit had cleared, but would be back again soon, and that the strictest\\ninjunctions had been left with mrs musgrove to keep her there\\ntill they returned.  she had only to submit, sit down,\\nbe outwardly composed, and feel herself plunged at once\\nin all the agitations which she had merely laid her account of\\ntasting a little before the morning closed.  there was no delay,\\nno waste of time.  she was deep in the happiness of such misery,\\nor the misery of such happiness, instantly.  two minutes after\\nher entering the room, captain wentworth said--\\n\\n\"we will write the letter we were talking of, harville, now,\\nif you will give me materials.\"\\n\\nmaterials were at hand, on a separate table; he went to it,\\nand nearly turning his back to them all, was engrossed by writing.\\n\\nmrs musgrove was giving mrs croft the history of her eldest\\ndaughter\\'s engagement, and just in that inconvenient tone of voice\\nwhich was perfectly audible while it pretended to be a whisper.\\nanne felt that she did not belong to the conversation, and yet,\\nas captain harville seemed thoughtful and not disposed to talk,\\nshe could not avoid hearing many undesirable particulars; such as,\\n\"how mr musgrove and my brother hayter had met again and again\\nto talk it over; what my brother hayter had said one day,\\nand what mr musgrove had proposed the next, and what had occurred\\nto my sister hayter, and what the young people had wished, and what\\ni said at first i never could consent to, but was afterwards persuaded\\nto think might do very well,\" and a great deal in the same style\\nof open-hearted communication:  minutiae which, even with every advantage\\nof taste and delicacy, which good mrs musgrove could not give,\\ncould be properly interesting only to the principals.  mrs croft\\nwas attending with great good-humour, and whenever she spoke at all,\\nit was very sensibly.  anne hoped the gentlemen might each be\\ntoo much self-occupied to hear.\\n\\n\"and so, ma\\'am, all these thing considered,\" said mrs musgrove,\\nin her powerful whisper, \"though we could have wished it different,\\nyet, altogether, we did not think it fair to stand out any longer,\\nfor charles hayter was quite wild about it, and henrietta was\\npretty near as bad; and so we thought they had better marry at once,\\nand make the best of it, as many others have done before them.\\nat any rate, said i, it will be better than a long engagement.\"\\n\\n\"that is precisely what i was going to observe,\" cried mrs croft.\\n\"i would rather have young people settle on a small income at once,\\nand have to struggle with a few difficulties together, than be\\ninvolved in a long engagement.  i always think that no mutual--\"\\n\\n\"oh! dear mrs croft,\" cried mrs musgrove, unable to let her\\nfinish her speech, \"there is nothing i so abominate for young people\\nas a long engagement.  it is what i always protested against\\nfor my children.  it is all very well, i used to say, for young people\\nto be engaged, if there is a certainty of their being able to marry\\nin six months, or even in twelve; but a long engagement--\"\\n\\n\"yes, dear ma\\'am,\" said mrs croft, \"or an uncertain engagement,\\nan engagement which may be long.  to begin without knowing\\nthat at such a time there will be the means of marrying,\\ni hold to be very unsafe and unwise, and what i think all parents\\nshould prevent as far as they can.\"\\n\\nanne found an unexpected interest here.  she felt its application\\nto herself, felt it in a nervous thrill all over her; and at the same\\nmoment that her eyes instinctively glanced towards the distant table,\\ncaptain wentworth\\'s pen ceased to move, his head was raised, pausing,\\nlistening, and he turned round the next instant to give a look,\\none quick, conscious look at her.\\n\\nthe two ladies continued to talk, to re-urge the same admitted truths,\\nand enforce them with such examples of the ill effect of\\na contrary practice as had fallen within their observation,\\nbut anne heard nothing distinctly; it was only a buzz of words in her ear,\\nher mind was in confusion.\\n\\ncaptain harville, who had in truth been hearing none of it,\\nnow left his seat, and moved to a window, and anne seeming to watch him,\\nthough it was from thorough absence of mind, became gradually sensible\\nthat he was inviting her to join him where he stood.  he looked at her\\nwith a smile, and a little motion of the head, which expressed,\\n\"come to me, i have something to say;\" and the unaffected,\\neasy kindness of manner which denoted the feelings of an older acquaintance\\nthan he really was, strongly enforced the invitation.  she roused herself\\nand went to him.  the window at which he stood was at the other end\\nof the room from where the two ladies were sitting, and though nearer\\nto captain wentworth\\'s table, not very near.  as she joined him,\\ncaptain harville\\'s countenance re-assumed the serious, thoughtful\\nexpression which seemed its natural character.\\n\\n\"look here,\" said he, unfolding a parcel in his hand, and displaying\\na small miniature painting, \"do you know who that is?\"\\n\\n\"certainly:  captain benwick.\"\\n\\n\"yes, and you may guess who it is for.  but,\" (in a deep tone,)\\n\"it was not done for her.  miss elliot, do you remember our\\nwalking together at lyme, and grieving for him?  i little thought then--\\nbut no matter.  this was drawn at the cape.  he met with\\na clever young german artist at the cape, and in compliance with a promise\\nto my poor sister, sat to him, and was bringing it home for her;\\nand i have now the charge of getting it properly set for another!\\nit was a commission to me!  but who else was there to employ?\\ni hope i can allow for him.  i am not sorry, indeed, to make it\\nover to another.  he undertakes it;\" (looking towards captain wentworth,)\\n\"he is writing about it now.\"  and with a quivering lip he wound up\\nthe whole by adding, \"poor fanny! she would not have forgotten him so soon!\"\\n\\n\"no,\" replied anne, in a low, feeling voice. \"that i can easily believe.\"\\n\\n\"it was not in her nature.  she doted on him.\"\\n\\n\"it would not be the nature of any woman who truly loved.\"\\n\\ncaptain harville smiled, as much as to say, \"do you claim that\\nfor your sex?\" and she answered the question, smiling also,\\n\"yes.  we certainly do not forget you as soon as you forget us.\\nit is, perhaps, our fate rather than our merit.  we cannot help ourselves.\\nwe live at home, quiet, confined, and our feelings prey upon us.\\nyou are forced on exertion.  you have always a profession, pursuits,\\nbusiness of some sort or other, to take you back into the world immediately,\\nand continual occupation and change soon weaken impressions.\"\\n\\n\"granting your assertion that the world does all this so soon for men\\n(which, however, i do not think i shall grant), it does not apply\\nto benwick.  he has not been forced upon any exertion.  the peace\\nturned him on shore at the very moment, and he has been living with us,\\nin our little family circle, ever since.\"\\n\\n\"true,\" said anne, \"very true; i did not recollect; but what shall\\nwe say now, captain harville?  if the change be not from\\noutward circumstances, it must be from within; it must be nature,\\nman\\'s nature, which has done the business for captain benwick.\"\\n\\n\"no, no, it is not man\\'s nature.  i will not allow it to be more\\nman\\'s nature than woman\\'s to be inconstant and forget those they do love,\\nor have loved.  i believe the reverse.  i believe in a true analogy\\nbetween our bodily frames and our mental; and that as our bodies are\\nthe strongest, so are our feelings; capable of bearing most rough usage,\\nand riding out the heaviest weather.\"\\n\\n\"your feelings may be the strongest,\" replied anne, \"but the same spirit\\nof analogy will authorise me to assert that ours are the most tender.\\nman is more robust than woman, but he is not longer lived;\\nwhich exactly explains my view of the nature of their attachments.\\nnay, it would be too hard upon you, if it were otherwise.\\nyou have difficulties, and privations, and dangers enough to struggle with.\\nyou are always labouring and toiling, exposed to every risk and hardship.\\nyour home, country, friends, all quitted.  neither time, nor health,\\nnor life, to be called your own.  it would be hard, indeed\"\\n(with a faltering voice), \"if woman\\'s feelings were to be\\nadded to all this.\"\\n\\n\"we shall never agree upon this question,\" captain harville\\nwas beginning to say, when a slight noise called their attention\\nto captain wentworth\\'s hitherto perfectly quiet division of the room.\\nit was nothing more than that his pen had fallen down; but anne was\\nstartled at finding him nearer than she had supposed, and half inclined\\nto suspect that the pen had only fallen because he had been\\noccupied by them, striving to catch sounds, which yet she did not think\\nhe could have caught.\\n\\n\"have you finished your letter?\" said captain harville.\\n\\n\"not quite, a few lines more.  i shall have done in five minutes.\"\\n\\n\"there is no hurry on my side.  i am only ready whenever you are.\\ni am in very good anchorage here,\" (smiling at anne,) \"well supplied,\\nand want for nothing.  no hurry for a signal at all.  well, miss elliot,\"\\n(lowering his voice,) \"as i was saying we shall never agree,\\ni suppose, upon this point.  no man and woman, would, probably.\\nbut let me observe that all histories are against you--all stories,\\nprose and verse.  if i had such a memory as benwick, i could bring you\\nfifty quotations in a moment on my side the argument, and i do not think\\ni ever opened a book in my life which had not something to say\\nupon woman\\'s inconstancy.  songs and proverbs, all talk\\nof woman\\'s fickleness.  but perhaps you will say, these were all\\nwritten by men.\"\\n\\n\"perhaps i shall.  yes, yes, if you please, no reference to examples\\nin books.  men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story.\\neducation has been theirs in so much higher a degree; the pen has\\nbeen in their hands.  i will not allow books to prove anything.\"\\n\\n\"but how shall we prove anything?\"\\n\\n\"we never shall.  we never can expect to prove any thing upon such a point.\\nit is a difference of opinion which does not admit of proof.\\nwe each begin, probably, with a little bias towards our own sex;\\nand upon that bias build every circumstance in favour of it\\nwhich has occurred within our own circle; many of which circumstances\\n(perhaps those very cases which strike us the most) may be precisely such\\nas cannot be brought forward without betraying a confidence,\\nor in some respect saying what should not be said.\"\\n\\n\"ah!\" cried captain harville, in a tone of strong feeling,\\n\"if i could but make you comprehend what a man suffers when he takes\\na last look at his wife and children, and watches the boat\\nthat he has sent them off in, as long as it is in sight,\\nand then turns away and says, `god knows whether we ever meet again!\\'\\nand then, if i could convey to you the glow of his soul when he does\\nsee them again; when, coming back after a twelvemonth\\'s absence,\\nperhaps, and obliged to put into another port, he calculates how soon\\nit be possible to get them there, pretending to deceive himself,\\nand saying, `they cannot be here till such a day,\\' but all the while\\nhoping for them twelve hours sooner, and seeing them arrive at last,\\nas if heaven had given them wings, by many hours sooner still!\\nif i could explain to you all this, and all that a man can bear and do,\\nand glories to do, for the sake of these treasures of his existence!\\ni speak, you know, only of such men as have hearts!\" pressing his own\\nwith emotion.\\n\\n\"oh!\" cried anne eagerly, \"i hope i do justice to all that is felt by you,\\nand by those who resemble you.  god forbid that i should undervalue\\nthe warm and faithful feelings of any of my fellow-creatures!\\ni should deserve utter contempt if i dared to suppose that true attachment\\nand constancy were known only by woman.  no, i believe you capable\\nof everything great and good in your married lives.  i believe you equal\\nto every important exertion, and to every domestic forbearance,\\nso long as--if i may be allowed the expression--so long as you have\\nan object.  i mean while the woman you love lives, and lives for you.\\nall the privilege i claim for my own sex (it is not a very enviable one;\\nyou need not covet it), is that of loving longest, when existence\\nor when hope is gone.\"\\n\\nshe could not immediately have uttered another sentence; her heart\\nwas too full, her breath too much oppressed.\\n\\n\"you are a good soul,\" cried captain harville, putting his hand\\non her arm, quite affectionately.  \"there is no quarrelling with you.\\nand when i think of benwick, my tongue is tied.\"\\n\\ntheir attention was called towards the others.  mrs croft was taking leave.\\n\\n\"here, frederick, you and i part company, i believe,\" said she.\\n\"i am going home, and you have an engagement with your friend.\\nto-night we may have the pleasure of all meeting again at your party,\"\\n(turning to anne.)  \"we had your sister\\'s card yesterday,\\nand i understood frederick had a card too, though i did not see it;\\nand you are disengaged, frederick, are you not, as well as ourselves?\"\\n\\ncaptain wentworth was folding up a letter in great haste, and either\\ncould not or would not answer fully.\\n\\n\"yes,\" said he, \"very true; here we separate, but harville and i\\nshall soon be after you; that is, harville, if you are ready,\\ni am in half a minute.  i know you will not be sorry to be off.\\ni shall be at your service in half a minute.\"\\n\\nmrs croft left them, and captain wentworth, having sealed his letter\\nwith great rapidity, was indeed ready, and had even a hurried,\\nagitated air, which shewed impatience to be gone.  anne knew not how\\nto understand it.  she had the kindest \"good morning, god bless you!\"\\nfrom captain harville, but from him not a word, nor a look!\\nhe had passed out of the room without a look!\\n\\nshe had only time, however, to move closer to the table where\\nhe had been writing, when footsteps were heard returning;\\nthe door opened, it was himself.  he begged their pardon,\\nbut he had forgotten his gloves, and instantly crossing the room\\nto the writing table, he drew out a letter from under the scattered paper,\\nplaced it before anne with eyes of glowing entreaty fixed on her\\nfor a time, and hastily collecting his gloves, was again out of the room,\\nalmost before mrs musgrove was aware of his being in it:\\nthe work of an instant!\\n\\nthe revolution which one instant had made in anne, was almost\\nbeyond expression.  the letter, with a direction hardly legible,\\nto \"miss a. e.--,\" was evidently the one which he had been folding\\nso hastily.  while supposed to be writing only to captain benwick,\\nhe had been also addressing her!  on the contents of that letter\\ndepended all which this world could do for her.  anything was possible,\\nanything might be defied rather than suspense.  mrs musgrove had\\nlittle arrangements of her own at her own table; to their protection\\nshe must trust, and sinking into the chair which he had occupied,\\nsucceeding to the very spot where he had leaned and written,\\nher eyes devoured the following words:\\n\\n\\n\"i can listen no longer in silence.  i must speak to you by such means\\nas are within my reach.  you pierce my soul.  i am half agony,\\nhalf hope.  tell me not that i am too late, that such precious feelings\\nare gone for ever.  i offer myself to you again with a heart\\neven more your own than when you almost broke it, eight years\\nand a half ago.  dare not say that man forgets sooner than  woman,\\nthat his love has an earlier death.  i have loved none but you.\\nunjust i may have been, weak and resentful i have been,\\nbut never inconstant.  you alone have brought me to bath.\\nfor you alone, i think and plan.  have you not seen this?\\ncan you fail to have understood my wishes?  i had not waited even\\nthese ten days, could i have read your feelings, as i think you must have\\npenetrated mine.  i can hardly write.  i am every instant hearing\\nsomething which overpowers me.  you sink your voice, but i can\\ndistinguish the tones of that voice when they would be lost on others.\\ntoo good, too excellent creature!  you do us justice, indeed.\\nyou do believe that there is true attachment and constancy among men.\\nbelieve it to be most fervent, most undeviating, in f. w.\\n\\n\"i must go, uncertain of my fate; but i shall return hither,\\nor follow your party, as soon as possible.  a word, a look,\\nwill be enough to decide whether i enter your father\\'s house\\nthis evening or never.\"\\n\\n\\nsuch a letter was not to be soon recovered from.  half and hour\\'s solitude\\nand reflection might have tranquillized her; but the ten minutes only\\nwhich now passed before she was interrupted, with all the restraints\\nof her situation, could do nothing towards tranquillity.  every moment\\nrather brought fresh agitation.  it was overpowering happiness.\\nand before she was beyond the first stage of full sensation,\\ncharles, mary, and henrietta all came in.\\n\\nthe absolute necessity of seeming like herself produced then\\nan immediate struggle; but after a while she could do no more.\\nshe began not to understand a word they said, and was obliged\\nto plead indisposition and excuse herself.  they could then see\\nthat she looked very ill, were shocked and concerned, and would not\\nstir without her for the world.  this was dreadful.  would they only\\nhave gone away, and left her in the quiet possession of that room\\nit would have been her cure; but to have them all standing or\\nwaiting around her was distracting, and in desperation,\\nshe said she would go home.\\n\\n\"by all means, my dear,\" cried mrs musgrove, \"go home directly,\\nand take care of yourself, that you may be fit for the evening.\\ni wish sarah was here to doctor you, but i am no doctor myself.\\ncharles, ring and order a chair.  she must not walk.\"\\n\\nbut the chair would never do.  worse than all!  to lose the possibility\\nof speaking two words to captain wentworth in the course of her quiet,\\nsolitary progress up the town (and she felt almost certain of meeting him)\\ncould not be borne.  the chair was earnestly protested against,\\nand mrs musgrove, who thought only of one sort of illness,\\nhaving assured herself with some anxiety, that there had been no fall\\nin the case; that anne had not at any time lately slipped down,\\nand got a blow on her head; that she was perfectly convinced of having\\nhad no fall; could part with her cheerfully, and depend on\\nfinding her better at night.\\n\\nanxious to omit no possible precaution, anne struggled, and said--\\n\\n\"i am afraid, ma\\'am, that it is not perfectly understood.\\npray be so good as to mention to the other gentlemen that we hope\\nto see your whole party this evening.  i am afraid there had been\\nsome mistake; and i wish you particularly to assure captain harville\\nand captain wentworth, that we hope to see them both.\"\\n\\n\"oh! my dear, it is quite understood, i give you my word.\\ncaptain harville has no thought but of going.\"\\n\\n\"do you think so?  but i am afraid; and i should be so very sorry.\\nwill you promise me to mention it, when you see them again?\\nyou will see them both this morning, i dare say.  do promise me.\"\\n\\n\"to be sure i will, if you wish it.  charles, if you see captain harville\\nanywhere, remember to give miss anne\\'s message.  but indeed, my dear,\\nyou need not be uneasy.  captain harville holds himself quite engaged,\\ni\\'ll answer for it; and captain wentworth the same, i dare say.\"\\n\\nanne could do no more; but her heart prophesied some mischance\\nto damp the perfection of her felicity.  it could not be very lasting,\\nhowever.  even if he did not come to camden place himself,\\nit would be in her power to send an intelligible sentence\\nby captain harville.  another momentary vexation occurred.\\ncharles, in his real concern and good nature, would go home with her;\\nthere was no preventing him.  this was almost cruel.  but she could not\\nbe long ungrateful; he was sacrificing an engagement at a gunsmith\\'s,\\nto be of use to her; and she set off with him, with no feeling\\nbut gratitude apparent.\\n\\nthey were on union street, when a quicker step behind, a something\\nof familiar sound, gave her two moments\\' preparation for the sight\\nof captain wentworth.  he joined them; but, as if irresolute\\nwhether to join or to pass on, said nothing, only looked.\\nanne could command herself enough to receive that look,\\nand not repulsively.  the cheeks which had been pale now glowed,\\nand the movements which had hesitated were decided.  he walked by her side.\\npresently, struck by a sudden thought, charles said--\\n\\n\"captain wentworth, which way are you going?  only to gay street,\\nor farther up the town?\"\\n\\n\"i hardly know,\" replied captain wentworth, surprised.\\n\\n\"are you going as high as belmont?  are you going near camden place?\\nbecause, if you are, i shall have no scruple in asking you\\nto take my place, and give anne your arm to her father\\'s door.\\nshe is rather done for this morning, and must not go so far without help,\\nand i ought to be at that fellow\\'s in the market place.\\nhe promised me the sight of a capital gun he is just going to send off;\\nsaid he would keep it unpacked to the last possible moment,\\nthat i might see it; and if i do not turn back now, i have no chance.\\nby his description, a good deal like the second size double-barrel of mine,\\nwhich you shot with one day round winthrop.\"\\n\\nthere could not be an objection.  there could be only the most\\nproper alacrity, a most obliging compliance for public view;\\nand smiles reined in and spirits dancing in private rapture.\\nin half a minute charles was at the bottom of union street again,\\nand the other two proceeding together:  and soon words enough had passed\\nbetween them to decide their direction towards the comparatively quiet\\nand retired gravel walk, where the power of conversation would make\\nthe present hour a blessing indeed, and prepare it for all\\nthe immortality which the happiest recollections of their own future lives\\ncould bestow.  there they exchanged again those feelings\\nand those promises which had once before seemed to secure everything,\\nbut which had been followed by so many, many years of division\\nand estrangement.  there they returned again into the past,\\nmore exquisitely happy, perhaps, in their re-union, than when\\nit had been first projected; more tender, more tried, more fixed\\nin a knowledge of each other\\'s character, truth, and attachment;\\nmore equal to act, more justified in acting.  and there, as they slowly\\npaced the gradual ascent, heedless of every group around them,\\nseeing neither sauntering politicians, bustling housekeepers,\\nflirting girls, nor nursery-maids and children, they could indulge in\\nthose retrospections and acknowledgements, and especially in\\nthose explanations of what had directly preceded the present moment,\\nwhich were so poignant and so ceaseless in interest.  all the little\\nvariations of the last week were gone through; and of yesterday\\nand today there could scarcely be an end.\\n\\nshe had not mistaken him.  jealousy of mr elliot had been\\nthe retarding weight, the doubt, the torment.  that had begun to operate\\nin the very hour of first meeting her in bath; that had returned,\\nafter a short suspension, to ruin the concert; and that had influenced him\\nin everything he had said and done, or omitted to say and do,\\nin the last four-and-twenty hours.  it had been gradually yielding\\nto the better hopes which her looks, or words, or actions\\noccasionally encouraged; it had been vanquished at last by\\nthose sentiments and those tones which had reached him while she talked\\nwith captain harville; and under the irresistible governance of which\\nhe had seized a sheet of paper, and poured out his feelings.\\n\\nof what he had then written, nothing was to be retracted or qualified.\\nhe persisted in having loved none but her.  she had never been supplanted.\\nhe never even believed himself to see her equal.  thus much indeed\\nhe was obliged to acknowledge:  that he had been constant unconsciously,\\nnay unintentionally; that he had meant to forget her, and believed it\\nto be done.  he had imagined himself indifferent, when he had only\\nbeen angry; and he had been unjust to her merits, because he had been\\na sufferer from them.  her character was now fixed on his mind\\nas perfection itself, maintaining the loveliest medium of fortitude\\nand gentleness; but he was obliged to acknowledge that only at uppercross\\nhad he learnt to do her justice, and only at lyme had he begun\\nto understand himself.  at lyme, he had received lessons\\nof more than one sort.  the passing admiration of mr elliot\\nhad at least roused him, and the scenes on the cobb and at\\ncaptain harville\\'s had fixed her superiority.\\n\\nin his preceding attempts to attach himself to louisa musgrove\\n(the attempts of angry pride), he protested that he had for ever\\nfelt it to be impossible; that he had not cared, could not care,\\nfor louisa; though till that day, till the leisure for reflection\\nwhich followed it, he had not understood the perfect excellence\\nof the mind with which louisa\\'s could so ill bear a comparison,\\nor the perfect unrivalled hold it possessed over his own.\\nthere, he had learnt to distinguish between the steadiness of principle\\nand the obstinacy of self-will, between the darings of heedlessness\\nand the resolution of a collected mind.  there he had seen everything\\nto exalt in his estimation the woman he had lost; and there begun\\nto deplore the pride, the folly, the madness of resentment,\\nwhich had kept him from trying to regain her when thrown in his way.\\n\\nfrom that period his penance had become severe.  he had no sooner\\nbeen free from the horror and remorse attending the first few days\\nof louisa\\'s accident, no sooner begun to feel himself alive again,\\nthan he had begun to feel himself, though alive, not at liberty.\\n\\n\"i found,\" said he, \"that i was considered by harville an engaged man!\\nthat neither harville nor his wife entertained a doubt of our\\nmutual attachment.  i was startled and shocked.  to a degree,\\ni could contradict this instantly; but, when i began to reflect\\nthat others might have felt the same--her own family, nay,\\nperhaps herself--i was no longer at my own disposal.  i was hers in honour\\nif she wished it.  i had been unguarded.  i had not thought seriously\\non this subject before.  i had not considered that my excessive intimacy\\nmust have its danger of ill consequence in many ways; and that i had\\nno right to be trying whether i could attach myself to either of the girls,\\nat the risk of raising even an unpleasant report, were there no other\\nill effects.  i had been grossly wrong, and must abide the consequences.\"\\n\\nhe found too late, in short, that he had entangled himself;\\nand that precisely as he became fully satisfied of his not caring\\nfor louisa at all, he must regard himself as bound to her,\\nif her sentiments for him were what the harvilles supposed.\\nit determined him to leave lyme, and await her complete recovery elsewhere.\\nhe would gladly weaken, by any fair means, whatever feelings or\\nspeculations concerning him might exist; and he went, therefore,\\nto his brother\\'s, meaning after a while to return to kellynch,\\nand act as circumstances might require.\\n\\n\"i was six weeks with edward,\" said he, \"and saw him happy.\\ni could have no other pleasure.  i deserved none.  he enquired after you\\nvery particularly; asked even if you were personally altered,\\nlittle suspecting that to my eye you could never alter.\"\\n\\nanne smiled, and let it pass.  it was too pleasing a blunder\\nfor a reproach.  it is something for a woman to be assured,\\nin her eight-and-twentieth year, that she has not lost one charm\\nof earlier youth; but the value of such homage was inexpressibly increased\\nto anne, by comparing it with former words, and feeling it to be\\nthe result, not the cause of a revival of his warm attachment.\\n\\nhe had remained in shropshire, lamenting the blindness of his own pride,\\nand the blunders of his own calculations, till at once released from louisa\\nby the astonishing and felicitous intelligence of her engagement\\nwith benwick.\\n\\n\"here,\" said he, \"ended the worst of my state; for now i could at least\\nput myself in the way of happiness; i could exert myself;\\ni could do something.  but to be waiting so long in inaction,\\nand waiting only for evil, had been dreadful.  within the first\\nfive minutes i said, `i will be at bath on wednesday,\\' and i was.\\nwas it unpardonable to think it worth my while to come? and to arrive\\nwith some degree of hope?  you were single.  it was possible that\\nyou might retain the feelings of the past, as i did; and one encouragement\\nhappened to be mine.  i could never doubt that you would be loved and\\nsought by others, but i knew to a certainty that you had refused one man,\\nat least, of better pretensions than myself; and i could not help\\noften saying, `was this for me?\\'\"\\n\\ntheir first meeting in milsom street afforded much to be said,\\nbut the concert still more.  that evening seemed to be made up\\nof exquisite moments.  the moment of her stepping forward\\nin the octagon room to speak to him:  the moment of mr elliot\\'s appearing\\nand tearing her away, and one or two subsequent moments,\\nmarked by returning hope or increasing despondency, were dwelt on\\nwith energy.\\n\\n\"to see you,\" cried he, \"in the midst of those who could not be\\nmy well-wishers; to see your cousin close by you, conversing and smiling,\\nand feel all the horrible eligibilities and proprieties of the match!\\nto consider it as the certain wish of every being who could hope\\nto influence you!  even if your own feelings were reluctant or indifferent,\\nto consider what powerful supports would be his!  was it not enough\\nto make the fool of me which i appeared?  how could i look on\\nwithout agony?  was not the very sight of the friend who sat behind you,\\nwas not the recollection of what had been, the knowledge of her influence,\\nthe indelible, immoveable impression of what persuasion had once done--\\nwas it not all against me?\"\\n\\n\"you should have distinguished,\" replied anne.  \"you should not have\\nsuspected me now; the case is so different, and my age is so different.\\nif i was wrong in yielding to persuasion once, remember that\\nit was to persuasion exerted on the side of safety, not of risk.\\nwhen i yielded, i thought it was to duty, but no duty could be called\\nin aid here.  in marrying a man indifferent to me, all risk\\nwould have been incurred, and all duty violated.\"\\n\\n\"perhaps i ought to have reasoned thus,\" he replied, \"but i could not.\\ni could not derive benefit from the late knowledge i had acquired\\nof your character.  i could not bring it into play; it was overwhelmed,\\nburied, lost in those earlier feelings which i had been smarting under\\nyear after year.  i could think of you only as one who had yielded,\\nwho had given me up, who had been influenced by any one rather than by me.\\ni saw you with the very person who had guided you in that year of misery.\\ni had no reason to believe her of less authority now.  the force of habit\\nwas to be added.\"\\n\\n\"i should have thought,\" said anne, \"that my manner to yourself\\nmight have spared you much or all of this.\"\\n\\n\"no, no! your manner might be only the ease which your engagement\\nto another man would give.  i left you in this belief; and yet,\\ni was determined to see you again.  my spirits rallied with the morning,\\nand i felt that i had still a motive for remaining here.\"\\n\\nat last anne was at home again, and happier than any one in that house\\ncould have conceived.  all the surprise and suspense, and every other\\npainful part of the morning dissipated by this conversation,\\nshe re-entered the house so happy as to be obliged to find an alloy\\nin some momentary apprehensions of its being impossible to last.\\nan interval of meditation, serious and grateful, was the best corrective\\nof everything dangerous in such high-wrought felicity; and she went\\nto her room, and grew steadfast and fearless in the thankfulness\\nof her enjoyment.\\n\\nthe evening came, the drawing-rooms were lighted up, the company assembled.\\nit was but a card party, it was but a mixture of those who had\\nnever met before, and those who met too often; a commonplace business,\\ntoo numerous for intimacy, too small for variety; but anne had never found\\nan evening shorter.  glowing and lovely in sensibility and happiness,\\nand more generally admired than she thought about or cared for,\\nshe had cheerful or forbearing feelings for every creature around her.\\nmr elliot was there; she avoided, but she could pity him.\\nthe wallises, she had amusement in understanding them.  lady dalrymple\\nand miss carteret--they would soon be innoxious cousins to her.\\nshe cared not for mrs clay, and had nothing to blush for in\\nthe public manners of her father and sister.  with the musgroves,\\nthere was the happy chat of perfect ease; with captain harville,\\nthe kind-hearted intercourse of brother and sister; with lady russell,\\nattempts at conversation, which a delicious consciousness cut short;\\nwith admiral and mrs croft, everything of peculiar cordiality and\\nfervent interest, which the same consciousness sought to conceal;\\nand with captain wentworth, some moments of communications\\ncontinually occurring, and always the hope of more, and always\\nthe knowledge of his being there.\\n\\nit was in one of these short meetings, each apparently occupied\\nin admiring a fine display of greenhouse plants, that she said--\\n\\n\"i have been thinking over the past, and trying impartially\\nto judge of the right and wrong, i mean with regard to myself;\\nand i must believe that i was right, much as i suffered from it,\\nthat i was perfectly right in being guided by the friend whom\\nyou will love better than you do now.  to me, she was in the place\\nof a parent.  do not mistake me, however.  i am not saying\\nthat she did not err in her advice.  it was, perhaps, one of those cases\\nin which advice is good or bad only as the event decides;\\nand for myself, i certainly never should, in any circumstance\\nof tolerable similarity, give such advice.  but i mean, that i was right\\nin submitting to her, and that if i had done otherwise, i should have\\nsuffered more in continuing the engagement than i did even in giving it up,\\nbecause i should have suffered in my conscience.  i have now,\\nas far as such a sentiment is allowable in human nature, nothing\\nto reproach myself with; and if i mistake not, a strong sense of duty\\nis no bad part of a woman\\'s portion.\"\\n\\nhe looked at her, looked at lady russell, and looking again at her,\\nreplied, as if in cool deliberation--\\n\\n\"not yet.  but there are hopes of her being forgiven in time.\\ni trust to being in charity with her soon.  but i too have been\\nthinking over the past, and a  question has suggested itself,\\nwhether there may not have been one person more my enemy\\neven than that lady?  my own self.  tell me if, when i returned\\nto england in the year eight, with a few thousand pounds,\\nand was posted into the laconia, if i had then written to you,\\nwould you have answered my letter?  would you, in short,\\nhave renewed the engagement then?\"\\n\\n\"would i!\" was all her answer; but the accent was decisive enough.\\n\\n\"good god!\" he cried, \"you would!  it is not that i did not think of it,\\nor desire it, as what could alone crown all my other success;\\nbut i was proud, too proud to ask again.  i did not understand you.\\ni shut my eyes, and would not understand you, or do you justice.\\nthis is a recollection which ought to make me forgive every one\\nsooner than myself.  six years of separation and suffering\\nmight have been spared.  it is a sort of pain, too, which is new to me.\\ni have been used to the gratification of believing myself to earn\\nevery blessing that i enjoyed.  i have valued myself on honourable toils\\nand just rewards.  like other great men under reverses,\" he added,\\nwith a smile. \"i must endeavour to subdue my mind to my fortune.\\ni must learn to brook being happier than i deserve.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 24\\n\\n\\nwho can be in doubt of what followed?  when any two young people\\ntake it into their heads to marry, they are pretty sure by perseverance\\nto carry their point, be they ever so poor, or ever so imprudent,\\nor ever so little likely to be necessary to each other\\'s ultimate comfort.\\nthis may be bad morality to conclude with, but i believe it to be truth;\\nand if such parties succeed, how should a captain wentworth and\\nan anne elliot, with the advantage of maturity of mind,\\nconsciousness of right, and one independent fortune between them,\\nfail of bearing down every opposition?  they might in fact,\\nhave borne down a great deal more than they met with, for there was\\nlittle to distress them beyond the want of graciousness and warmth.\\nsir walter made no objection, and elizabeth did nothing worse\\nthan look cold and unconcerned.  captain wentworth, with five-and-twenty\\nthousand pounds, and as high in his profession as merit and activity\\ncould place him, was no longer nobody.  he was now esteemed quite worthy\\nto address the daughter of a foolish, spendthrift baronet,\\nwho had not had principle or sense enough to maintain himself\\nin the situation in which providence had placed him, and who could\\ngive his daughter at present but a small part of the share\\nof ten thousand pounds which must be hers hereafter.\\n\\nsir walter, indeed, though he had no affection for anne,\\nand no vanity flattered, to make him really happy on the occasion,\\nwas very far from thinking it a bad match for her.  on the contrary,\\nwhen he saw more of captain wentworth, saw him repeatedly by daylight,\\nand eyed him well, he was very much struck by his personal claims,\\nand felt that his superiority of appearance might be not unfairly balanced\\nagainst her superiority of rank; and all this, assisted by\\nhis well-sounding name, enabled sir walter at last to prepare his pen,\\nwith a very good grace, for the insertion of the marriage\\nin the volume of honour.\\n\\nthe only one among them, whose opposition of feeling could excite\\nany serious anxiety was lady russell.  anne knew that lady russell\\nmust be suffering some pain in understanding and relinquishing mr elliot,\\nand be making some struggles to become truly acquainted with,\\nand do justice to captain wentworth.  this however was what\\nlady russell had now to do.  she must learn to feel that she had\\nbeen mistaken with regard to both; that she had been unfairly influenced\\nby appearances in each; that because captain wentworth\\'s manners\\nhad not suited her own ideas, she had been too quick in suspecting them\\nto indicate a character of dangerous impetuosity; and that because\\nmr elliot\\'s manners had precisely pleased her in their propriety\\nand correctness, their general politeness and suavity, she had been\\ntoo quick in receiving them as the certain result of the most correct\\nopinions and well-regulated mind.  there was nothing less\\nfor lady russell to do, than to admit that she had been\\npretty completely wrong, and to take up a new set of opinions\\nand of hopes.\\n\\nthere is a quickness of perception in some, a nicety in the discernment\\nof character, a natural penetration, in short, which no experience\\nin others can equal, and lady russell had been less gifted\\nin this part of understanding than her young friend.  but she was\\na very good woman, and if her second object was to be sensible\\nand well-judging, her first was to see anne happy.  she loved anne\\nbetter than she loved her own abilities; and when the awkwardness\\nof the beginning was over, found little hardship in attaching herself\\nas a mother to the man who was securing the happiness of her other child.\\n\\nof all the family, mary was probably the one most immediately gratified\\nby the circumstance.  it was creditable to have a sister married,\\nand she might flatter herself with having been greatly instrumental\\nto the connexion, by keeping anne with her in the autumn;\\nand as her own sister must be better than her husband\\'s sisters,\\nit was very agreeable that captain wentworth should be a richer man than\\neither captain benwick or charles hayter.  she had something to suffer,\\nperhaps, when they came into contact again, in seeing anne restored\\nto the rights of seniority, and the mistress of a very pretty landaulette;\\nbut she had a future to look forward to, of powerful consolation.\\nanne had no uppercross hall before her, no landed estate,\\nno headship of a family; and if they could but keep captain wentworth\\nfrom being made a baronet, she would not change situations with anne.\\n\\nit would be well for the eldest sister if she were equally satisfied\\nwith her situation, for a change is not very probable there.\\nshe had soon the mortification of seeing mr elliot withdraw,\\nand no one of proper condition has since presented himself to raise\\neven the unfounded hopes which sunk with him.\\n\\nthe news of his cousins anne\\'s engagement burst on mr elliot\\nmost unexpectedly.  it deranged his best plan of domestic happiness,\\nhis best hope of keeping sir walter single by the watchfulness\\nwhich a son-in-law\\'s rights would have given.  but, though discomfited\\nand disappointed, he could still do something for his own interest\\nand his own enjoyment.  he soon quitted bath; and on mrs clay\\'s\\nquitting it soon afterwards, and being next heard of as established\\nunder his protection in london, it was evident how double a game\\nhe had been playing, and how determined he was to save himself\\nfrom being cut out by one artful woman, at least.\\n\\nmrs clay\\'s affections had overpowered her interest, and she had sacrificed,\\nfor the young man\\'s sake, the possibility of scheming longer\\nfor sir walter.  she has abilities, however, as well as affections;\\nand it is now a doubtful point whether his cunning, or hers,\\nmay finally carry the day; whether, after preventing her from being\\nthe wife of sir walter, he may not be wheedled and caressed at last\\ninto making her the wife of sir william.\\n\\nit cannot be doubted that sir walter and elizabeth were shocked\\nand mortified by the loss of their companion, and the discovery of\\ntheir deception in her.  they had their great cousins, to be sure,\\nto resort to for comfort; but they must long feel that to flatter\\nand follow others, without being flattered and followed in turn,\\nis but a state of half enjoyment.\\n\\nanne, satisfied at a very early period of lady russell\\'s meaning\\nto love captain wentworth as she ought, had no other alloy\\nto the happiness of her prospects than what arose from the consciousness\\nof having no relations to bestow on him which a man of sense could value.\\nthere she felt her own inferiority very keenly.  the disproportion\\nin their fortune was nothing; it did not give her a moment\\'s regret;\\nbut to have no family to receive and estimate him properly,\\nnothing of respectability, of harmony, of good will to offer\\nin return for all the worth and all the prompt welcome which met her\\nin his brothers and sisters, was a source of as lively pain\\nas her mind could well be sensible of under circumstances of otherwise\\nstrong felicity.  she had but two friends in the world to add to his list,\\nlady russell and mrs smith.  to those, however, he was very well disposed\\nto attach himself.  lady russell, in spite of all her former transgressions,\\nhe could now value from his heart.  while he was not obliged to say\\nthat he believed her to have been right in originally dividing them,\\nhe was ready to say almost everything else in her favour,\\nand as for mrs smith, she had claims of various kinds to recommend her\\nquickly and permanently.\\n\\nher recent good offices by anne had been enough in themselves,\\nand their marriage, instead of depriving her of one friend,\\nsecured her two.  she was their earliest visitor in their settled life;\\nand captain wentworth, by putting her in the way of recovering\\nher husband\\'s property in the west indies, by writing for her,\\nacting for her, and seeing her through all the petty difficulties\\nof the case with the activity and exertion of a fearless man\\nand a determined friend, fully requited the services which\\nshe had rendered, or ever meant to render, to his wife.\\n\\nmrs smith\\'s enjoyments were not spoiled by this improvement of income,\\nwith some improvement of health, and the acquisition of such friends\\nto be often with, for her cheerfulness and mental alacrity did not\\nfail her; and while these prime supplies of good remained, she might have\\nbid defiance even to greater accessions of worldly prosperity.\\nshe might have been absolutely rich and perfectly healthy,\\nand yet be happy.  her spring of felicity was in the glow\\nof her spirits, as her friend anne\\'s was in the warmth of her heart.\\nanne was tenderness itself, and she had the full worth of it\\nin captain wentworth\\'s affection.  his profession was all that could ever\\nmake her friends wish that tenderness less, the dread of a future war\\nall that could dim her sunshine.  she gloried in being a sailor\\'s wife,\\nbut she must pay the tax of quick alarm for belonging to that profession\\nwhich is, if possible, more distinguished in its domestic virtues\\nthan in its national importance.\\n\\n\\n\\n        finis\\n\\n\\n\\n'"

baronet from a to z whom\\nher feelings could have so willingly acknowledged as an equal\\nyet so miserably had he conducted himself that though she was\\nat this present time the summer of 1814 wearing black ribbons\\nfor his wife she could not admit him to be worth thinking of again\\nthe disgrace of his first marriage might perhaps as there was\\nno reason to suppose it perpetuated by offspring have been got over\\nhad he not done worse but he had as by the accustomary intervention\\nof kind friends they had been informed spoken most disrespectfully\\nof them all most slightingly and contemptuously of the very blood\\nhe belonged to and the honours which were hereafter to be his own\\nthis could not be pardoned\\n\\nsuch were elizabeth elliots sentiments and sensations such the cares\\nto alloy the agitations to vary the sameness and the elegance\\nthe prosperity and the nothingness of her scene of life\\nsuch the feelings to give interest to a long uneventful residence\\nin one country circle to fill the vacancies which there were no habits\\nof utility abroad no talents or accomplishments for home to occupy\\n\\nbut now another occupation and solicitude of mind was beginning to be\\nadded to these  her father was growing distressed for money\\nshe knew that when he now took up the baronetage it was to drive\\nthe heavy bills of his tradespeople and the unwelcome hints of\\nmr shepherd his agent from his thoughts  the kellynch property was good\\nbut not equal to sir walters apprehension of the state required\\nin its possessor  while lady elliot lived there had been method\\nmoderation and economy which had just kept him within his income\\nbut with her had died all such rightmindedness and from that period\\nhe had been constantly exceeding it  it had not been possible\\nfor him to spend less he had done nothing but what sir walter elliot\\nwas imperiously called on to do but blameless as he was he was\\nnot only growing dreadfully in debt but was hearing of it so often\\nthat it became vain to attempt concealing it longer even partially\\nfrom his daughter  he had given her some hints of it the last spring\\nin town he had gone so far even as to say can we retrench\\ndoes it occur to you that there is any one article in which\\nwe can retrench and elizabeth to do her justice had in the first\\nardour of female alarm set seriously to think what could be done\\nand had finally proposed these two branches of economy to cut off\\nsome unnecessary charities and to refrain from new furnishing\\nthe drawingroom to which expedients she afterwards added\\nthe happy thought of their taking no present down to anne\\nas had been the usual yearly custom  but these measures\\nhowever good in themselves were insufficient for the real extent\\nof the evil the whole of which sir walter found himself obliged\\nto confess to her soon afterwards  elizabeth had nothing to propose\\nof deeper efficacy  she felt herself illused and unfortunate\\nas did her father and they were neither of them able to devise\\nany means of lessening their expenses without compromising their dignity\\nor relinquishing their comforts in a way not to be borne\\n\\nthere was only a small part of his estate that sir walter could dispose of\\nbut had every acre been alienable it would have made no difference\\nhe had condescended to mortgage as far as he had the power\\nbut he would never condescend to sell  no he would never disgrace\\nhis name so far  the kellynch estate should be transmitted whole\\nand entire as he had received it\\n\\ntheir two confidential friends mr shepherd who lived in\\nthe neighbouring market town and lady russell were called to advise them\\nand both father and daughter seemed to expect that something should be\\nstruck out by one or the other to remove their embarrassments\\nand reduce their expenditure without involving the loss of\\nany indulgence of taste or pride\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 2\\n\\n\\nmr shepherd a civil cautious lawyer who whatever might be his hold\\nor his views on sir walter would rather have the disagreeable\\nprompted by anybody else excused himself from offering the slightest hint\\nand only begged leave to recommend an implicit reference to\\nthe excellent judgement of lady russell from whose known good sense\\nhe fully expected to have just such resolute measures advised as\\nhe meant to see finally adopted\\n\\nlady russell was most anxiously zealous on the subject and gave it\\nmuch serious consideration  she was a woman rather of sound than of\\nquick abilities whose difficulties in coming to any decision\\nin this instance were great from the opposition of two leading principles\\nshe was of strict integrity herself with a delicate sense of honour\\nbut she was as desirous of saving sir walters feelings as solicitous\\nfor the credit of the family as aristocratic in her ideas of what\\nwas due to them as anybody of sense and honesty could well be\\nshe was a benevolent charitable good woman and capable of\\nstrong attachments most correct in her conduct strict in her notions\\nof decorum and with manners that were held a standard of goodbreeding\\nshe had a cultivated mind and was generally speaking\\nrational and consistent but she had prejudices on the side of ancestry\\nshe had a value for rank and consequence which blinded her a little\\nto the faults of those who possessed them  herself the widow of\\nonly a knight she gave the dignity of a baronet all its due\\nand sir walter independent of his claims as an old acquaintance\\nan attentive neighbour an obliging landlord the husband of her\\nvery dear friend the father of anne and her sisters was\\nas being sir walter in her apprehension entitled to a great deal\\nof compassion and consideration under his present difficulties\\n\\nthey must retrench that did not admit of a doubt  but she was\\nvery anxious to have it done with the least possible pain to him\\nand elizabeth she drew up plans of economy she made exact calculations\\nand she did what nobody else thought of doing  she consulted anne\\nwho never seemed considered by the others as having any interest\\nin the question she consulted and in a degree was influenced by her\\nin marking out the scheme of retrenchment which was at last submitted\\nto sir walter every emendation of annes had been on the side of\\nhonesty against importance  she wanted more vigorous measures\\na more complete reformation a quicker release from debt\\na much higher tone of indifference for everything but justice and equity\\n\\nif we can persuade your father to all this said lady russell\\nlooking over her paper much may be done  if he will adopt\\nthese regulations in seven years he will be clear and i hope\\nwe may be able to convince him and elizabeth that kellynch hall has\\na respectability in itself which cannot be affected by these reductions\\nand that the true dignity of sir walter elliot will be very far from\\nlessened in the eyes of sensible people by acting like a man of principle\\nwhat will he be doing in fact but what very many of our first families\\nhave done or ought to do  there will be nothing singular in his case\\nand it is singularity which often makes the worst part of our suffering\\nas it always does of our conduct  i have great hope of prevailing\\nwe must be serious and decided for after all the person who\\nhas contracted debts must pay them and though a great deal is due to\\nthe feelings of the gentleman and the head of a house like your father\\nthere is still more due to the character of an honest man\\n\\nthis was the principle on which anne wanted her father to be proceeding\\nhis friends to be urging him  she considered it as an act\\nof indispensable duty to clear away the claims of creditors with\\nall the expedition which the most comprehensive retrenchments\\ncould secure and saw no dignity in anything short of it\\nshe wanted it to be prescribed and felt as a duty  she rated\\nlady russells influence highly and as to the severe degree\\nof selfdenial which her own conscience prompted she believed\\nthere might be little more difficulty in persuading them to a complete\\nthan to half a reformation  her knowledge of her father\\nand elizabeth inclined her to think that the sacrifice of one pair\\nof horses would be hardly less painful than of both and so on\\nthrough the whole list of lady russells too gentle reductions\\n\\nhow annes more rigid requisitions might have been taken\\nis of little consequence  lady russells had no success at all\\ncould not be put up with were not to be borne what every comfort\\nof life knocked off  journeys london servants horses table\\ncontractions and restrictions every where  to live no longer\\nwith the decencies even of a private gentleman  no he would sooner\\nquit kellynch hall at once than remain in it on such disgraceful terms\\n\\nquit kellynch hall  the hint was immediately taken up by mr shepherd\\nwhose interest was involved in the reality of sir walters retrenching\\nand who was perfectly persuaded that nothing would be done without\\na change of abode  since the idea had been started in the very quarter\\nwhich ought to dictate he had no scruple he said in confessing\\nhis judgement to be entirely on that side  it did not appear to him\\nthat sir walter could materially alter his style of living in a house\\nwhich had such a character of hospitality and ancient dignity to support\\nin any other place sir walter might judge for himself and would\\nbe looked up to as regulating the modes of life in whatever way\\nhe might choose to model his household\\n\\nsir walter would quit kellynch hall and after a very few days more\\nof doubt and indecision the great question of whither he should go\\nwas settled and the first outline of this important change made out\\n\\nthere had been three alternatives london bath or another house\\nin the country  all annes wishes had been for the latter\\na small house in their own neighbourhood where they might still have\\nlady russells society still be near mary and still have the pleasure\\nof sometimes seeing the lawns and groves of kellynch was the object\\nof her ambition  but the usual fate of anne attended her\\nin having something very opposite from her inclination fixed on\\nshe disliked bath and did not think it agreed with her\\nand bath was to be her home\\n\\nsir walter had at first thought more of london but mr shepherd felt\\nthat he could not be trusted in london and had been skilful enough\\nto dissuade him from it and make bath preferred  it was a much safer\\nplace for a gentleman in his predicament  he might there be important\\nat comparatively little expense  two material advantages of bath\\nover london had of course been given all their weight  its more convenient\\ndistance from kellynch only fifty miles and lady russells spending\\nsome part of every winter there and to the very great satisfaction\\nof lady russell whose first views on the projected change had been\\nfor bath sir walter and elizabeth were induced to believe that\\nthey should lose neither consequence nor enjoyment by settling there\\n\\nlady russell felt obliged to oppose her dear annes known wishes\\nit would be too much to expect sir walter to descend into a small house\\nin his own neighbourhood  anne herself would have found\\nthe mortifications of it more than she foresaw and to sir walters\\nfeelings they must have been dreadful  and with regard to annes\\ndislike of bath she considered it as a prejudice and mistake arising\\nfirst from the circumstance of her having been three years\\nat school there after her mothers death and secondly\\nfrom her happening to be not in perfectly good spirits the only winter\\nwhich she had afterwards spent there with herself\\n\\nlady russell was fond of bath in short and disposed to think\\nit must suit them all and as to her young friends health\\nby passing all the warm months with her at kellynch lodge\\nevery danger would be avoided and it was in fact a change which must\\ndo both health and spirits good  anne had been too little from home\\ntoo little seen her spirits were not high  a larger society\\nwould improve them  she wanted her to be more known\\n\\nthe undesirableness of any other house in the same neighbourhood\\nfor sir walter was certainly much strengthened by one part\\nand a very material part of the scheme which had been happily\\nengrafted on the beginning  he was not only to quit his home\\nbut to see it in the hands of others a trial of fortitude\\nwhich stronger heads than sir walters have found too much\\nkellynch hall was to be let  this however was a profound secret\\nnot to be breathed beyond their own circle\\n\\nsir walter could not have borne the degradation of being known\\nto design letting his house  mr shepherd had once mentioned the word\\nadvertise but never dared approach it again  sir walter spurned\\nthe idea of its being offered in any manner forbad the slightest hint\\nbeing dropped of his having such an intention and it was only on\\nthe supposition of his being spontaneously solicited by some most\\nunexceptionable applicant on his own terms and as a great favour\\nthat he would let it at all\\n\\nhow quick come the reasons for approving what we like  lady russell had\\nanother excellent one at hand for being extremely glad that sir walter\\nand his family were to remove from the country  elizabeth had been\\nlately forming an intimacy which she wished to see interrupted\\nit was with the daughter of mr shepherd who had returned\\nafter an unprosperous marriage to her fathers house with\\nthe additional burden of two children  she was a clever young woman\\nwho understood the art of pleasingthe art of pleasing at least\\nat kellynch hall and who had made herself so acceptable to miss elliot\\nas to have been already staying there more than once in spite of all\\nthat lady russell who thought it a friendship quite out of place\\ncould hint of caution and reserve\\n\\nlady russell indeed had scarcely any influence with elizabeth\\nand seemed to love her rather because she would love her\\nthan because elizabeth deserved it  she had never received from her more\\nthan outward attention nothing beyond the observances of complaisance\\nhad never succeeded in any point which she wanted to carry\\nagainst previous inclination  she had been repeatedly very earnest\\nin trying to get anne included in the visit to london sensibly open\\nto all the injustice and all the discredit of the selfish arrangements\\nwhich shut her out and on many lesser occasions had endeavoured\\nto give elizabeth the advantage of her own better judgement and experience\\nbut always in vain  elizabeth would go her own way and never had she\\npursued it in more decided opposition to lady russell than in\\nthis selection of mrs clay turning from the society of so deserving\\na sister to bestow her affection and confidence on one who ought\\nto have been nothing to her but the object of distant civility\\n\\nfrom situation mrs clay was in lady russells estimate a very unequal\\nand in her character she believed a very dangerous companion\\nand a removal that would leave mrs clay behind and bring a choice\\nof more suitable intimates within miss elliots reach was therefore\\nan object of firstrate importance\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 3\\n\\n\\ni must take leave to observe sir walter said mr shepherd\\none morning at kellynch hall as he laid down the newspaper\\nthat the present juncture is much in our favour  this peace will\\nbe turning all our rich naval officers ashore  they will be\\nall wanting a home  could not be a better time sir walter\\nfor having a choice of tenants very responsible tenants\\nmany a noble fortune has been made during the war  if a rich admiral\\nwere to come in our way sir walter\\n\\nhe would be a very lucky man shepherd replied sir walter\\nthats all i have to remark  a prize indeed would kellynch hall\\nbe to him rather the greatest prize of all let him have taken\\never so many before hey shepherd\\n\\nmr shepherd laughed as he knew he must at this wit and then added\\n\\ni presume to observe sir walter that in the way of business\\ngentlemen of the navy are well to deal with  i have had a little knowledge\\nof their methods of doing business and i am free to confess that they\\nhave very liberal notions and are as likely to make desirable tenants\\nas any set of people one should meet with  therefore sir walter\\nwhat i would take leave to suggest is that if in consequence of\\nany rumours getting abroad of your intention which must be contemplated\\nas a possible thing because we know how difficult it is to keep\\nthe actions and designs of one part of the world from the notice\\nand curiosity of the other consequence has its tax i john shepherd\\nmight conceal any familymatters that i chose for nobody would think it\\nworth their while to observe me but sir walter elliot has eyes upon him\\nwhich it may be very difficult to elude and therefore thus much\\ni venture upon that it will not greatly surprise me if\\nwith all our caution some rumour of the truth should get abroad\\nin the supposition of which as i was going to observe since applications\\nwill unquestionably follow i should think any from our wealthy\\nnaval commanders particularly worth attending to and beg leave to add\\nthat two hours will bring me over at any time to save you\\nthe trouble of replying\\n\\nsir walter only nodded  but soon afterwards rising and pacing the room\\nhe observed sarcastically\\n\\nthere are few among the gentlemen of the navy i imagine who would\\nnot be surprised to find themselves in a house of this description\\n\\nthey would look around them no doubt and bless their good fortune\\nsaid mrs clay for mrs clay was present  her father had driven her over\\nnothing being of so much use to mrs clays health as a drive to kellynch\\nbut i quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might be\\na very desirable tenant  i have known a good deal of the profession\\nand besides their liberality they are so neat and careful\\nin all their ways  these valuable pictures of yours sir walter\\nif you chose to leave them would be perfectly safe  everything in\\nand about the house would be taken such excellent care of\\nthe gardens and shrubberies would be kept in almost as high order\\nas they are now  you need not be afraid miss elliot of your own\\nsweet flower gardens being neglected\\n\\nas to all that rejoined sir walter coolly supposing i were induced\\nto let my house i have by no means made up my mind as to the privileges\\nto be annexed to it  i am not particularly disposed to favour a tenant\\nthe park would be open to him of course and few navy officers\\nor men of any other description can have had such a range\\nbut what restrictions i might impose on the use of the pleasuregrounds\\nis another thing  i am not fond of the idea of my shrubberies being\\nalways approachable and i should recommend miss elliot to be on her guard\\nwith respect to her flower garden  i am very little disposed\\nto grant a tenant of kellynch hall any extraordinary favour\\ni assure you be he sailor or soldier\\n\\nafter a short pause mr shepherd presumed to say\\n\\nin all these cases there are established usages which\\nmake everything plain and easy between landlord and tenant\\nyour interest sir walter is in pretty safe hands  depend upon me\\nfor taking care that no tenant has more than his just rights\\ni venture to hint that sir walter elliot cannot be half so jealous\\nfor his own as john shepherd will be for him\\n\\nhere anne spoke\\n\\nthe navy i think who have done so much for us have at least\\nan equal claim with any other set of men for all the comforts and\\nall the privileges which any home can give  sailors work hard enough\\nfor their comforts we must all allow\\n\\nvery true very true  what miss anne says is very true\\nwas mr shepherds rejoinder and oh certainly was his daughters\\nbut sir walters remark was soon afterwards\\n\\nthe profession has its utility but i should be sorry to see\\nany friend of mine belonging to it\\n\\nindeed was the reply and with a look of surprise\\n\\nyes it is in two points offensive to me i have two strong grounds\\nof objection to it  first as being the means of bringing persons\\nof obscure birth into undue distinction and raising men to honours\\nwhich their fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of and secondly\\nas it cuts up a mans youth and vigour most horribly a sailor grows old\\nsooner than any other man  i have observed it all my life\\na man is in greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise\\nof one whose father his father might have disdained to speak to\\nand of becoming prematurely an object of disgust himself than in\\nany other line  one day last spring in town i was in company\\nwith two men striking instances of what i am talking of\\nlord st ives whose father we all know to have been a country curate\\nwithout bread to eat i was to give place to lord st ives\\nand a certain admiral baldwin the most deplorablelooking personage\\nyou can imagine his face the colour of mahogany rough and rugged\\nto the last degree all lines and wrinkles nine grey hairs of a side\\nand nothing but a dab of powder at top  in the name of heaven\\nwho is that old fellow said i to a friend of mine who was standing near\\nsir basil morley  old fellow cried sir basil it is admiral baldwin\\nwhat do you take his age to be  sixty said i or perhaps sixtytwo\\nforty replied sir basil forty and no more  picture to yourselves\\nmy amazement i shall not easily forget admiral baldwin\\ni never saw quite so wretched an example of what a seafaring life can do\\nbut to a degree i know it is the same with them all  they are all\\nknocked about and exposed to every climate and every weather\\ntill they are not fit to be seen  it is a pity they are not knocked\\non the head at once before they reach admiral baldwins age\\n\\nnay sir walter cried mrs clay this is being severe indeed\\nhave a little mercy on the poor men  we are not all born to be handsome\\nthe sea is no beautifier certainly sailors do grow old betimes\\ni have observed it they soon lose the look of youth  but then\\nis not it the same with many other professions perhaps most other\\nsoldiers in active service are not at all better off  and even in\\nthe quieter professions there is a toil and a labour of the mind\\nif not of the body which seldom leaves a mans looks to the natural\\neffect of time  the lawyer plods quite careworn the physician\\nis up at all hours and travelling in all weather and even\\nthe clergyman she stopt a moment to consider what might\\ndo for the clergymanand even the clergyman you know is obliged\\nto go into infected rooms and expose his health and looks to\\nall the injury of a poisonous atmosphere  in fact as i have\\nlong been convinced though every profession is necessary and honourable\\nin its turn it is only the lot of those who are not obliged to follow any\\nwho can live in a regular way in the country choosing their own hours\\nfollowing their own pursuits and living on their own property\\nwithout the torment of trying for more it is only their lot i say\\nto hold the blessings of health and a good appearance to the utmost\\ni know no other set of men but what lose something of their personableness\\nwhen they cease to be quite young\\n\\nit seemed as if mr shepherd in this anxiety to bespeak\\nsir walters good will towards a naval officer as tenant\\nhad been gifted with foresight for the very first application\\nfor the house was from an admiral croft with whom he shortly afterwards\\nfell into company in attending the quarter sessions at taunton and indeed\\nhe had received a hint of the admiral from a london correspondent\\nby the report which he hastened over to kellynch to make\\nadmiral croft was a native of somersetshire who having acquired\\na very handsome fortune was wishing to settle in his own country\\nand had come down to taunton in order to look at some advertised places\\nin that immediate neighbourhood which however had not suited him\\nthat accidentally hearingit was just as he had foretold\\nmr shepherd observed sir walters concerns could not be kept a secret\\naccidentally hearing of the possibility of kellynch hall being to let\\nand understanding his mr shepherds connection with the owner\\nhe had introduced himself to him in order to make particular inquiries\\nand had in the course of a pretty long conference expressed as strong\\nan inclination for the place as a man who knew it only by description\\ncould feel and given mr shepherd in his explicit account of himself\\nevery proof of his being a most responsible eligible tenant\\n\\nand who is admiral croft was sir walters cold suspicious inquiry\\n\\nmr shepherd answered for his being of a gentlemans family\\nand mentioned a place and anne after the little pause which followed\\nadded\\n\\nhe is a rear admiral of the white  he was in the trafalgar action\\nand has been in the east indies since he was stationed there\\ni believe several years\\n\\nthen i take it for granted observed sir walter that his face\\nis about as orange as the cuffs and capes of my livery\\n\\nmr shepherd hastened to assure him that admiral croft was a very hale\\nhearty welllooking man a little weatherbeaten to be sure\\nbut not much and quite the gentleman in all his notions and behaviour\\nnot likely to make the smallest difficulty about terms only wanted\\na comfortable home and to get into it as soon as possible\\nknew he must pay for his convenience knew what rent a readyfurnished\\nhouse of that consequence might fetch should not have been surprised\\nif sir walter had asked more had inquired about the manor\\nwould be glad of the deputation certainly but made no great point of it\\nsaid he sometimes took out a gun but never killed quite the gentleman\\n\\nmr shepherd was eloquent on the subject pointing out all\\nthe circumstances of the admirals family which made him\\npeculiarly desirable as a tenant  he was a married man\\nand without children the very state to be wished for  a house was\\nnever taken good care of mr shepherd observed without a lady\\nhe did not know whether furniture might not be in danger of suffering\\nas much where there was no lady as where there were many children\\na lady without a family was the very best preserver of furniture\\nin the world  he had seen mrs croft too she was at taunton\\nwith the admiral and had been present almost all the time they were\\ntalking the matter over\\n\\nand a very wellspoken genteel shrewd lady she seemed to be\\ncontinued he asked more questions about the house and terms\\nand taxes than the admiral himself and seemed more conversant\\nwith business and moreover sir walter i found she was not quite\\nunconnected in this country any more than her husband that is to say\\nshe is sister to a gentleman who did live amongst us once\\nshe told me so herself  sister to the gentleman who lived\\na few years back at monkford  bless me what was his name\\nat this moment i cannot recollect his name though i have heard it so lately\\npenelope my dear can you help me to the name of the gentleman\\nwho lived at monkford  mrs crofts brother\\n\\nbut mrs clay was talking so eagerly with miss elliot that she did not\\nhear the appeal\\n\\ni have no conception whom you can mean shepherd i remember\\nno gentleman resident at monkford since the time of old governor trent\\n\\nbless me how very odd  i shall forget my own name soon i suppose\\na name that i am so very well acquainted with knew the gentleman\\nso well by sight seen him a hundred times came to consult me once\\ni remember about a trespass of one of his neighbours farmers man\\nbreaking into his orchard wall torn down apples stolen\\ncaught in the fact and afterwards contrary to my judgement\\nsubmitted to an amicable compromise  very odd indeed\\n\\nafter waiting another moment\\n\\nyou mean mr wentworth i suppose said anne\\n\\nmr shepherd was all gratitude\\n\\nwentworth was the very name  mr wentworth was the very man\\nhe had the curacy of monkford you know sir walter some time back\\nfor two or three years  came there about the year 5 i take it\\nyou remember him i am sure\\n\\nwentworth  oh aymr wentworth the curate of monkford\\nyou misled me by the term gentleman  i thought you were speaking of\\nsome man of property  mr wentworth was nobody i remember\\nquite unconnected nothing to do with the strafford family\\none wonders how the names of many of our nobility become so common\\n\\nas mr shepherd perceived that this connexion of the crofts did them\\nno service with sir walter he mentioned it no more returning\\nwith all his zeal to dwell on the circumstances more indisputably\\nin their favour their age and number and fortune the high idea\\nthey had formed of kellynch hall and extreme solicitude for\\nthe advantage of renting it making it appear as if they ranked\\nnothing beyond the happiness of being the tenants of sir walter elliot\\nan extraordinary taste certainly could they have been supposed in\\nthe secret of sir walters estimate of the dues of a tenant\\n\\nit succeeded however and though sir walter must ever look with\\nan evil eye on anyone intending to inhabit that house and think them\\ninfinitely too well off in being permitted to rent it on the highest terms\\nhe was talked into allowing mr shepherd to proceed in the treaty\\nand authorising him to wait on admiral croft who still remained\\nat taunton and fix a day for the house being seen\\n\\nsir walter was not very wise but still he had experience enough\\nof the world to feel that a more unobjectionable tenant\\nin all essentials than admiral croft bid fair to be could hardly offer\\nso far went his understanding and his vanity supplied a little\\nadditional soothing in the admirals situation in life which was just\\nhigh enough and not too high  i have let my house to admiral croft\\nwould sound extremely well very much better than to any mere mr\\na mr save perhaps some half dozen in the nation always needs\\na note of explanation  an admiral speaks his own consequence\\nand at the same time can never make a baronet look small\\nin all their dealings and intercourse sir walter elliot must ever\\nhave the precedence\\n\\nnothing could be done without a reference to elizabeth\\nbut her inclination was growing so strong for a removal\\nthat she was happy to have it fixed and expedited by a tenant at hand\\nand not a word to suspend decision was uttered by her\\n\\nmr shepherd was completely empowered to act and no sooner had\\nsuch an end been reached than anne who had been a most attentive listener\\nto the whole left the room to seek the comfort of cool air for her\\nflushed cheeks and as she walked along a favourite grove said\\nwith a gentle sigh a few months more and he perhaps\\nmay be walking here\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 4\\n\\n\\nhe was not mr wentworth the former curate of monkford\\nhowever suspicious appearances may be but a captain frederick wentworth\\nhis brother who being made commander in consequence of the action\\noff st domingo and not immediately employed had come into somersetshire\\nin the summer of 1806 and having no parent living found a home\\nfor half a year at monkford  he was at that time a remarkably fine\\nyoung man with a great deal of intelligence spirit and brilliancy\\nand anne an extremely pretty girl with gentleness modesty taste\\nand feeling  half the sum of attraction on either side might have\\nbeen enough for he had nothing to do and she had hardly anybody to love\\nbut the encounter of such lavish recommendations could not fail\\nthey were gradually acquainted and when acquainted rapidly and\\ndeeply in love  it would be difficult to say which had seen\\nhighest perfection in the other or which had been the happiest\\nshe in receiving his declarations and proposals or he in\\nhaving them accepted\\n\\na short period of exquisite felicity followed and but a short one\\ntroubles soon arose  sir walter on being applied to without actually\\nwithholding his consent or saying it should never be gave it all\\nthe negative of great astonishment great coldness great silence\\nand a professed resolution of doing nothing for his daughter\\nhe thought it a very degrading alliance and lady russell though with\\nmore tempered and pardonable pride received it as a most unfortunate one\\n\\nanne elliot with all her claims of birth beauty and mind\\nto throw herself away at nineteen involve herself at nineteen\\nin an engagement with a young man who had nothing but himself\\nto recommend him and no hopes of attaining affluence but in the chances\\nof a most uncertain profession and no connexions to secure\\neven his farther rise in the profession would be indeed a throwing away\\nwhich she grieved to think of  anne elliot so young known to so few\\nto be snatched off by a stranger without alliance or fortune\\nor rather sunk by him into a state of most wearing anxious\\nyouthkilling dependence  it must not be if by any fair interference\\nof friendship any representations from one who had almost a mothers love\\nand mothers rights it would be prevented\\n\\ncaptain wentworth had no fortune  he had been lucky in his profession\\nbut spending freely what had come freely had realized nothing\\nbut he was confident that he should soon be rich\\nfull of life and ardour he knew that he should soon have a ship\\nand soon be on a station that would lead to everything he wanted\\nhe had always been lucky he knew he should be so still\\nsuch confidence powerful in its own warmth and bewitching in\\nthe wit which often expressed it must have been enough for anne\\nbut lady russell saw it very differently  his sanguine temper\\nand fearlessness of mind operated very differently on her\\nshe saw in it but an aggravation of the evil  it only added a\\ndangerous character to himself  he was brilliant he was headstrong\\nlady russell had little taste for wit and of anything approaching\\nto imprudence a horror  she deprecated the connexion in every light\\n\\nsuch opposition as these feelings produced was more than\\nanne could combat  young and gentle as she was it might yet\\nhave been possible to withstand her fathers illwill\\nthough unsoftened by one kind word or look on the part of her

believe\\nthe engagement a wrong thing  indiscreet improper hardly capable\\nof success and not deserving it  but it was not a merely selfish caution\\nunder which she acted in putting an end to it  had she not\\nimagined herself consulting his good even more than her own\\nshe could hardly have given him up  the belief of being prudent\\nand selfdenying principally for his advantage was her

spirits\\nhad been their lasting effect\\n\\nmore than seven years were gone since this little history\\nof sorrowful interest had reached its close and time had\\nsoftened down much perhaps nearly all of peculiar attachment to him\\nbut she had been too dependent on time alone no aid had been given\\nin change of place except in one visit to bath soon after the rupture\\nor in any novelty or enlargement of society  no one had ever\\ncome within the kellynch circle who could bear a comparison with\\nfrederick wentworth as he stood in her memory  no second attachment\\nthe only thoroughly natural happy and sufficient cure\\nat her time of life had been possible to the nice tone of her mind\\nthe fastidiousness of her taste in the small limits of the society\\naround them  she had been solicited when about twoandtwenty\\nto change her name by the young man who not long afterwards found\\na more willing mind in her younger sister and lady russell had\\nlamented her refusal for charles musgrove was the eldest son of a man\\nwhose landed property and general importance were second in that country\\nonly to sir walters and of good character and appearance\\nand however lady russell might have asked yet for something more\\nwhile anne was nineteen she would have rejoiced to see her at twentytwo\\nso respectably removed from the partialities and injustice of\\nher fathers house and settled so permanently near herself\\nbut in this case anne had left nothing for advice to do\\nand though lady russell as satisfied as ever with her own discretion\\nnever wished the past undone she began now to have the anxiety\\nwhich borders on hopelessness for annes being tempted by some man\\nof talents and independence to enter a state for which she held her\\nto be peculiarly fitted by her warm affections and domestic habits\\n\\nthey knew not each others opinion either its constancy or its change\\non the one leading point of annes conduct for the subject was never\\nalluded to but anne at sevenandtwenty thought very differently\\nfrom what she had been made to think at nineteen  she did not blame\\nlady russell she did not blame herself for having been guided by her\\nbut she felt that were any young person in similar circumstances\\nto apply to her for counsel they would never receive any of such\\ncertain immediate wretchedness such uncertain future good\\nshe was persuaded that under every disadvantage of disapprobation at home\\nand every anxiety attending his profession all their probable fears\\ndelays and disappointments she should yet have been a happier woman\\nin maintaining the engagement than she had been in the sacrifice of it\\nand this she fully believed had the usual share had even more than\\nthe usual share of all such solicitudes and suspense been theirs\\nwithout reference to the actual results of their case which\\nas it happened would have bestowed earlier prosperity than\\ncould be reasonably calculated on  all his sanguine expectations\\nall his confidence had been justified  his genius and ardour\\nhad seemed to foresee and to command his prosperous path\\nhe had very soon after their engagement ceased got employ\\nand all that he had told her would follow had taken place\\nhe had distinguished himself and early gained the other step in rank\\nand must now by successive captures have made a handsome fortune\\nshe had only navy lists and newspapers for her authority\\nbut she could not doubt his being rich and in favour of his constancy\\nshe had no reason to believe him married\\n\\nhow eloquent could anne elliot have been how eloquent at least\\nwere her wishes on the side of early warm attachment and a cheerful\\nconfidence in futurity against that overanxious caution which\\nseems to insult exertion and distrust providence  she had been forced\\ninto prudence in her youth she learned romance as she grew older\\nthe natural sequel of an unnatural beginning\\n\\nwith all these circumstances recollections and feelings\\nshe could not hear that captain wentworths sister was likely\\nto live at kellynch without a revival of former pain and many a stroll\\nand many a sigh were necessary to dispel the agitation of the idea\\nshe often told herself it was folly before she could harden her nerves\\nsufficiently to feel the continual discussion of the crofts\\nand their business no evil  she was assisted however by that\\nperfect indifference and apparent unconsciousness among the only three\\nof her own friends in the secret of the past which seemed almost to deny\\nany recollection of it  she could do justice to the superiority\\nof lady russells motives in this over those of her father and elizabeth\\nshe could honour all the better feelings of her calmness\\nbut the general air of oblivion among them was highly important\\nfrom whatever it sprung and in the event of admiral crofts really\\ntaking kellynch hall she rejoiced anew over the conviction which\\nhad always been most grateful to her of the past being known to\\nthose three only among her connexions by whom no syllable\\nshe believed would ever be whispered and in the trust that among his\\nthe brother only with whom he had been residing had received\\nany information of their shortlived engagement  that brother had been\\nlong removed from the country and being a sensible man and moreover\\na single man at the time she had a fond dependence on no human creatures\\nhaving heard of it from him\\n\\nthe sister mrs croft had then been out of england accompanying\\nher husband on a foreign station and her own sister mary\\nhad been at school while it all occurred and never admitted by\\nthe pride of some and the delicacy of others to the smallest knowledge\\nof it afterwards\\n\\nwith these supports she hoped that the acquaintance between herself\\nand the crofts which with lady russell still resident in kellynch\\nand mary fixed only three miles off must be anticipated\\nneed not involve any particular awkwardness\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 5\\n\\n\\non the morning appointed for admiral and mrs crofts seeing kellynch hall\\nanne found it most natural to take her almost daily walk to lady russells\\nand keep out of the way till all was over when she found it most natural\\nto be sorry that she had missed the opportunity of seeing them\\n\\nthis meeting of the two parties proved highly satisfactory\\nand decided the whole business at once  each lady was previously\\nwell disposed for an agreement and saw nothing therefore\\nbut good manners in the other and with regard to the gentlemen\\nthere was such an hearty good humour such an open trusting liberality\\non the admirals side as could not but influence sir walter\\nwho had besides been flattered into his very best and most polished\\nbehaviour by mr shepherds assurances of his being known by report\\nto the admiral as a model of good breeding\\n\\nthe house and grounds and furniture were approved the crofts\\nwere approved terms time every thing and every body was right\\nand mr shepherds clerks were set to work without there having been\\na single preliminary difference to modify of all that\\nthis indenture sheweth\\n\\nsir walter without hesitation declared the admiral to be\\nthe bestlooking sailor he had ever met with and went so far as to say\\nthat if his own man might have had the arranging of his hair\\nhe should not be ashamed of being seen with him any where\\nand the admiral with sympathetic cordiality observed to his wife\\nas they drove back through the park i thought we should soon\\ncome to a deal my dear in spite of what they told us at taunton\\nthe baronet will never set the thames on fire but there seems to be\\nno harm in him  reciprocal compliments which would have been\\nesteemed about equal\\n\\nthe crofts were to have possession at michaelmas and as sir walter\\nproposed removing to bath in the course of the preceding month\\nthere was no time to be lost in making every dependent arrangement\\n\\nlady russell convinced that anne would not be allowed to be of any use\\nor any importance in the choice of the house which they were\\ngoing to secure was very unwilling to have her hurried away so soon\\nand wanted to make it possible for her to stay behind till she might\\nconvey her to bath herself after christmas but having engagements\\nof her own which must take her from kellynch for several weeks\\nshe was unable to give the full invitation she wished and anne\\nthough dreading the possible heats of september in all the white glare\\nof bath and grieving to forego all the influence so sweet and so sad\\nof the autumnal months in the country did not think that\\neverything considered she wished to remain  it would be most right\\nand most wise and therefore must involve least suffering\\nto go with the others\\n\\nsomething occurred however to give her a different duty\\nmary often a little unwell and always thinking a great deal\\nof her own complaints and always in the habit of claiming anne\\nwhen anything was the matter was indisposed and foreseeing\\nthat she should not have a days health all the autumn entreated\\nor rather required her for it was hardly entreaty to come to\\nuppercross cottage and bear her company as long as she should want her\\ninstead of going to bath\\n\\ni cannot possibly do without anne was marys reasoning\\nand elizabeths reply was then i am sure anne had better stay\\nfor nobody will want her in bath\\n\\nto be claimed as a good though in an improper style is at least\\nbetter than being rejected as no good at all and anne glad to\\nbe thought of some use glad to have anything marked out as a duty\\nand certainly not sorry to have the scene of it in the country\\nand her own dear country readily agreed to stay\\n\\nthis invitation of marys removed all lady russells difficulties\\nand it was consequently soon settled that anne should not go to bath\\ntill lady russell took her and that all the intervening time\\nshould be divided between uppercross cottage and kellynch lodge\\n\\nso far all was perfectly right but lady russell was almost startled\\nby the wrong of one part of the kellynch hall plan when it burst on her\\nwhich was mrs clays being engaged to go to bath with sir walter\\nand elizabeth as a most important and valuable assistant to the latter\\nin all the business before her  lady russell was extremely sorry\\nthat such a measure should have been resorted to at all wondered\\ngrieved and feared and the affront it contained to anne\\nin mrs clays being of so much use while anne could be of none\\nwas a very sore aggravation\\n\\nanne herself was become hardened to such affronts but she felt\\nthe imprudence of the arrangement quite as keenly as lady russell\\nwith a great deal of quiet observation and a knowledge\\nwhich she often wished less of her fathers character she was\\nsensible that results the most serious to his family from the intimacy\\nwere more than possible  she did not imagine that her father\\nhad at present an idea of the kind  mrs clay had freckles\\nand a projecting tooth and a clumsy wrist which he was continually\\nmaking severe remarks upon in her absence but she was young\\nand certainly altogether welllooking and possessed in an acute mind\\nand assiduous pleasing manners infinitely more dangerous attractions\\nthan any merely personal might have been  anne was so impressed\\nby the degree of their danger that she could not excuse herself\\nfrom trying to make it perceptible to her sister  she had little hope\\nof success but elizabeth who in the event of such a reverse would be\\nso much more to be pitied than herself should never she thought\\nhave reason to reproach her for giving no warning\\n\\nshe spoke and seemed only to offend  elizabeth could not conceive\\nhow such an absurd suspicion should occur to her and indignantly\\nanswered for each partys perfectly knowing their situation\\n\\nmrs clay said she warmly never forgets who she is\\nand as i am rather better acquainted with her sentiments than you can be\\ni can assure you that upon the subject of marriage they are\\nparticularly nice and that she reprobates all inequality of condition\\nand rank more strongly than most people  and as to my father\\ni really should not have thought that he who has kept himself single\\nso long for our sakes need be suspected now  if mrs clay were\\na very beautiful woman i grant you it might be wrong to have her\\nso much with me not that anything in the world i am sure\\nwould induce my father to make a degrading match but he might\\nbe rendered unhappy  but poor mrs clay who with all her merits\\ncan never have been reckoned tolerably pretty i really think poor\\nmrs clay may be staying here in perfect safety  one would imagine\\nyou had never heard my father speak of her personal misfortunes\\nthough i know you must fifty times  that tooth of hers\\nand those freckles  freckles do not disgust me so very much\\nas they do him  i have known a face not materially disfigured by a few\\nbut he abominates them  you must have heard him notice\\nmrs clays freckles\\n\\nthere is hardly any personal defect replied anne\\nwhich an agreeable manner might not gradually reconcile one to\\n\\ni think very differently answered elizabeth shortly\\nan agreeable manner may set off handsome features but can never\\nalter plain ones  however at any rate as i have a great deal more\\nat stake on this point than anybody else can have i think it\\nrather unnecessary in you to be advising me\\n\\nanne had done glad that it was over and not absolutely hopeless\\nof doing good  elizabeth though resenting the suspicion\\nmight yet be made observant by it\\n\\nthe last office of the four carriagehorses was to draw sir walter\\nmiss elliot and mrs clay to bath  the party drove off in very good spirits\\nsir walter prepared with condescending bows for all the afflicted\\ntenantry and cottagers who might have had a hint to show themselves\\nand anne walked up at the same time in a sort of desolate tranquillity\\nto the lodge where she was to spend the first week\\n\\nher friend was not in better spirits than herself lady russell felt this\\nbreakup of the family exceedingly  their respectability was\\nas dear to her as her own and a daily intercourse had become\\nprecious by habit  it was painful to look upon their deserted grounds\\nand still worse to anticipate the new hands they were to fall into\\nand to escape the solitariness and the melancholy of so altered a village\\nand be out of the way when admiral and mrs croft first arrived\\nshe had determined to make her own absence from home begin\\nwhen she must give up anne  accordingly their removal was made together\\nand anne was set down at uppercross cottage in the first stage\\nof lady russells journey\\n\\nuppercross was a moderatesized village which a few years back\\nhad been completely in the old english style containing only\\ntwo houses superior in appearance to those of the yeomen and labourers\\nthe mansion of the squire with its high walls great gates and old trees\\nsubstantial and unmodernized and the compact tight parsonage\\nenclosed in its own neat garden with a vine and a peartree\\ntrained round its casements but upon the marriage of the young squire\\nit had received the improvement of a farmhouse elevated into a cottage\\nfor his residence and uppercross cottage with its veranda\\nfrench windows and other prettiness was quite as likely to catch\\nthe travellers eye as the more consistent and considerable aspect\\nand premises of the great house about a quarter of a mile farther on\\n\\nhere anne had often been staying  she knew the ways of uppercross\\nas well as those of kellynch  the two families were so continually meeting\\nso much in the habit of running in and out of each others house\\nat all hours that it was rather a surprise to her to find mary alone\\nbut being alone her being unwell and out of spirits was almost\\na matter of course  though better endowed than the elder sister\\nmary had not annes understanding nor temper  while well and happy\\nand properly attended to she had great good humour and excellent spirits\\nbut any indisposition sunk her completely  she had no resources\\nfor solitude and inheriting a considerable share of the elliot\\nselfimportance was very prone to add to every other distress\\nthat of fancying herself neglected and illused  in person she was\\ninferior to both sisters and had even in her bloom only reached\\nthe dignity of being a fine girl  she was now lying on the faded sofa\\nof the pretty little drawingroom the once elegant furniture of which\\nhad been gradually growing shabby under the influence of four summers\\nand two children and on annes appearing greeted her with\\n\\nso you are come at last  i began to think i should never see you\\ni am so ill i can hardly speak  i have not seen a creature\\nthe whole morning\\n\\ni am sorry to find you unwell replied anne  you sent me\\nsuch a good account of yourself on thursday\\n\\nyes i made the best of it i always do  but i was very far from well\\nat the time and i do not think i ever was so ill in my life\\nas i have been all this morning  very unfit to be left alone i am sure\\nsuppose i were to be seized of a sudden in some dreadful way\\nand not able to ring the bell  so lady russell would not get out\\ni do not think she has been in this house three times this summer\\n\\nanne said what was proper and enquired after her husband\\noh charles is out shooting  i have not seen him since seven oclock\\nhe would go though i told him how ill i was  he said he should not\\nstay out long but he has never come back and now it is almost one\\ni assure you i have not seen a soul this whole long morning\\n\\nyou have had your little boys with you\\n\\nyes as long as i could bear their noise but they are so unmanageable\\nthat they do me more harm than good  little charles does not mind\\na word i say and walter is growing quite as bad\\n\\nwell you will soon be better now replied anne cheerfully\\nyou know i always cure you when i come  how are your neighbours\\nat the great house\\n\\ni can give you no account of them  i have not seen one of them today\\nexcept mr musgrove who just stopped and spoke through the window\\nbut without getting off his horse and though i told him how ill i was\\nnot one of them have been near me  it did not happen to suit\\nthe miss musgroves i suppose and they never put themselves\\nout of their way\\n\\nyou will see them yet perhaps before the morning is gone\\nit is early\\n\\ni never want them i assure you  they talk and laugh a great deal\\ntoo much for me  oh anne i am so very unwell  it was quite unkind\\nof you not to come on thursday\\n\\nmy dear mary recollect what a comfortable account you sent me of yourself\\nyou wrote in the cheerfullest manner and said you were perfectly well\\nand in no hurry for me and that being the case you must be aware\\nthat my wish would be to remain with lady russell to the last\\nand besides what i felt on her account i have really been so busy\\nhave had so much to do that i could not very conveniently have\\nleft kellynch sooner\\n\\ndear me what can you possibly have to do\\n\\na great many things i assure you  more than i can recollect\\nin a moment but i can tell you some  i have been making\\na duplicate of the catalogue of my fathers books and pictures\\ni have been several times in the garden with mackenzie\\ntrying to understand and make him understand which of elizabeths plants\\nare for lady russell  i have had all my own little concerns\\nto arrange books and music to divide and all my trunks to repack\\nfrom not having understood in time what was intended as to the waggons\\nand one thing i have had to do mary of a more trying nature\\ngoing to almost every house in the parish as a sort of takeleave\\ni was told that they wished it  but all these things took up\\na great deal of time\\n\\noh well and after a moments pause but you have never asked me\\none word about our dinner at the pooles yesterday\\n\\ndid you go then  i have made no enquiries because i concluded\\nyou must have been obliged to give up the party\\n\\noh yes i went  i was very well yesterday nothing at all\\nthe matter with me till this morning  it would have been strange\\nif i had not gone\\n\\ni am very glad you were well enough and i hope you had a pleasant party\\n\\nnothing remarkable  one always knows beforehand what the dinner will be\\nand who will be there and it is so very uncomfortable not having\\na carriage of ones own  mr and mrs musgrove took me and we were\\nso crowded  they are both so very large and take up so much room\\nand mr musgrove always sits forward  so there was i crowded into\\nthe back seat with henrietta and louise and i think it very likely\\nthat my illness today may be owing to it\\n\\na little further perseverance in patience and forced cheerfulness\\non annes side produced nearly a cure on marys  she could soon\\nsit upright on the sofa and began to hope she might be able\\nto leave it by dinnertime  then forgetting to think of it\\nshe was at the other end of the room beautifying a nosegay\\nthen she ate her cold meat and then she was well enough\\nto propose a little walk\\n\\nwhere shall we go said she when they were ready  i suppose\\nyou will not like to call at the great house before they have\\nbeen to see you\\n\\ni have not the smallest objection on that account replied anne\\ni should never think of standing on such ceremony with people i know\\nso well as mrs and the miss musgroves\\n\\noh but they ought to call upon you as soon as possible\\nthey ought to feel what is due to you as my sister  however\\nwe may as well go and sit with them a little  while and when we\\nhave that over we can enjoy our walk\\n\\nanne had always thought such a style of intercourse highly imprudent\\nbut she had ceased to endeavour to check it from believing that\\nthough there were on each side continual subjects of offence\\nneither family could now do without it  to the great house accordingly\\nthey went to sit the full half hour in the oldfashioned square parlour\\nwith a small carpet and shining floor to which the present\\ndaughters of the house were gradually giving the proper air of confusion\\nby a grand pianoforte and a harp flowerstands and little tables\\nplaced in every direction  oh could the originals of the portraits\\nagainst the wainscot could the gentlemen in brown velvet and\\nthe ladies in blue satin have seen what was going on have been conscious\\nof such an overthrow of all order and neatness  the portraits themselves\\nseemed to be staring in astonishment\\n\\nthe musgroves like their houses were in a state of alteration\\nperhaps of improvement  the father and mother were in the old\\nenglish style and the young people in the new  mr and mrs musgrove\\nwere a very good sort of people friendly and hospitable\\nnot much educated and not at all elegant  their children had\\nmore modern minds and manners  there was a numerous family\\nbut the only two grown up excepting charles were henrietta and louisa\\nyoung ladies of nineteen and twenty who had brought from school at exeter\\nall the usual stock of accomplishments and were now like thousands\\nof other young ladies living to be fashionable happy and merry\\ntheir dress had every advantage their faces were rather pretty\\ntheir spirits extremely good their manner unembarrassed and pleasant\\nthey were of consequence at home and favourites abroad\\nanne always contemplated them as some of the happiest creatures\\nof her acquaintance but still saved as we all are by some\\ncomfortable feeling of superiority from wishing for the possibility\\nof exchange she would not have given up her own more elegant\\nand cultivated mind for all their enjoyments and envied them nothing\\nbut that seemingly perfect good understanding and agreement together\\nthat goodhumoured mutual affection of which she had known\\nso little herself with either of her sisters\\n\\nthey were received with great cordiality  nothing seemed amiss\\non the side of the great house family which was generally\\nas anne very well knew the least to blame  the half hour was\\nchatted away pleasantly enough and she was not at all surprised\\nat the end of it to have their walking party joined by both\\nthe miss musgroves at marys particular invitation\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 6\\n\\n\\nanne had not wanted this visit to uppercross to learn that a removal\\nfrom one set of people to another though at a distance of only three miles\\nwill often include a total change of conversation opinion and idea\\nshe had never been staying there before without being struck by it\\nor without wishing that other elliots could have her advantage\\nin seeing how unknown or unconsidered there were the affairs\\nwhich at kellynch hall were treated as of such general publicity\\nand pervading interest yet with all this experience she believed\\nshe must now submit to feel that another lesson in the art of knowing\\nour own nothingness beyond our own circle was become necessary for her\\nfor certainly coming as she did with a heart full of the subject\\nwhich had been completely occupying both houses in kellynch for many weeks\\nshe had expected rather more curiosity and sympathy than she found\\nin the separate but very similar remark of mr and mrs musgrove\\nso miss anne sir walter and your sister are gone and what part of bath\\ndo you think they will settle in and this without much\\nwaiting for an answer or in the young ladies addition of\\ni hope we shall be in bath in the winter but remember papa\\nif we do go we must be in a good situation  none of your\\nqueen squares for us or in the anxious supplement from mary of\\nupon my word i shall be pretty well off when you are all gone away\\nto be happy at bath\\n\\nshe could only resolve to avoid such selfdelusion in future\\nand think with heightened gratitude of the extraordinary blessing\\nof having one such truly sympathising friend as lady russell\\n\\nthe mr musgroves had their own game to guard and to destroy\\ntheir own horses dogs and newspapers to engage them and the females\\nwere fully occupied in all the other common subjects of housekeeping\\nneighbours dress dancing and music  she acknowledged it to be\\nvery fitting that every little social commonwealth should dictate\\nits own matters of discourse and hoped ere long to become\\na not unworthy member of the one she was now transplanted into\\nwith the prospect of spending at least two months at uppercross\\nit was highly incumbent on her to clothe her imagination her memory\\nand all her ideas in as much of uppercross as possible\\n\\nshe had no dread of these two months  mary was not so repulsive\\nand unsisterly as elizabeth nor so inaccessible to all influence of hers\\nneither was there anything among the other component parts\\nof the cottage inimical to comfort  she was always on friendly terms\\nwith her brotherinlaw and in the children who loved her nearly as well\\nand respected her a great deal more than their mother she had\\nan object of interest amusement and wholesome exertion\\n\\ncharles musgrove was civil and agreeable in sense and temper he was\\nundoubtedly superior to his wife but not of powers or conversation\\nor grace to make the past as they were connected together\\nat all a dangerous contemplation though at the same time\\nanne could believe with lady russell that a more equal match\\nmight have greatly improved him and that a woman of real understanding\\nmight have given more consequence to his character and more usefulness\\nrationality and elegance to his habits and pursuits  as it was\\nhe did nothing with much zeal but sport and his time was otherwise\\ntrifled away without benefit from books or anything else\\nhe had very good spirits which never seemed much affected by\\nhis wifes occasional lowness bore with her unreasonableness\\nsometimes to annes admiration and upon the whole though there was\\nvery often a little disagreement in which she had sometimes more share\\nthan she wished being appealed to by both parties they might pass\\nfor a happy couple  they were always perfectly agreed in the want\\nof more money and a strong inclination for a handsome present\\nfrom his father but here as on most topics he had the superiority\\nfor while mary thought it a great shame that such a present was not made\\nhe always contended for his fathers having many other uses for his money\\nand a right to spend it as he liked\\n\\nas to the management of their children his theory was much better\\nthan his wifes and his practice not so bad  i could manage them\\nvery well if it were not for marys interference was what\\nanne often heard him say and had a good deal of faith in\\nbut when listening in turn to marys reproach of charles spoils\\nthe children so that i cannot get them into any order she never had\\nthe smallest temptation to say very true\\n\\none of the least agreeable circumstances of her residence there\\nwas her being treated with too much confidence by all parties\\nand being too much in the secret of the complaints of each house\\nknown to have some influence with her sister she was continually requested\\nor at least receiving hints to exert it beyond what was practicable\\ni wish you could persuade mary not to be always fancying herself ill\\nwas charless language and in an unhappy mood thus spoke mary\\ni do believe if charles were to see me dying he would not think\\nthere was anything the matter with me  i am sure anne if you would\\nyou might persuade him that i really am very illa great deal worse\\nthan i ever own\\n\\nmarys declaration was i hate sending the children to the great house\\nthough their grandmamma is always wanting to see them for she humours\\nand indulges them to such a degree and gives them so much trash\\nand sweet things that they are sure to come back sick and cross\\nfor the rest of the day  and mrs musgrove took the first opportunity\\nof being alone with anne to say oh miss anne i cannot help wishing\\nmrs charles had a little of your method with those children\\nthey are quite different creatures with you  but to be sure\\nin general they are so spoilt  it is a pity you cannot put your sister\\nin the way of managing them  they are as fine healthy children\\nas ever were seen poor little dears without partiality\\nbut mrs charles knows no more how they should be treated\\nbless me how troublesome they are sometimes  i assure you miss anne\\nit prevents my wishing to see them at our house so often as\\ni otherwise should  i believe mrs charles is not quite pleased\\nwith my not inviting them oftener but you know it is very bad\\nto have children with one that one is obligated to be checking\\nevery moment dont do this and dont do that  or that one can\\nonly keep in tolerable order by more cake than is good for them\\n\\nshe had this communication moreover from mary  mrs musgrove thinks\\nall her servants so steady that it would be high treason\\nto call it in question but i am sure without exaggeration\\nthat her upper housemaid and laundrymaid instead of being\\nin their business are gadding about the village all day long\\ni meet them wherever i go and i declare i never go twice into my nursery\\nwithout seeing something of them  if jemima were not the trustiest\\nsteadiest creature in the world it would be enough to spoil her\\nfor she tells me they are always tempting her to take a walk with them\\nand on mrs musgroves side it was i make a rule of never interfering\\nin any of my daughterinlaws concerns for i know it would not do\\nbut i shall tell you miss anne because you may be able to set things\\nto rights that i have no very good opinion of mrs charless nurserymaid\\ni hear strange stories of her she is always upon the gad and from\\nmy own knowledge i can declare she is such a finedressing lady\\nthat she is enough to ruin any servants she comes near\\nmrs charles quite swears by her i know but i just give you this hint\\nthat you may be upon the watch because if you see anything amiss\\nyou need not be afraid of mentioning it\\n\\nagain it was marys complaint that mrs musgrove was very apt\\nnot to give her the precedence that was her due when they dined\\nat the great house with other families and she did not see any reason\\nwhy she was to be considered so much at home as to lose her place\\nand one day when anne was walking with only the musgroves one of them\\nafter talking of rank people of rank and jealousy of rank said\\ni have no scruple of observing to you how nonsensical some persons are\\nabout their place because all the world knows how easy and indifferent\\nyou are about it but i wish anybody could give mary a hint that\\nit would be a great deal better if she were not so very tenacious\\nespecially if she would not be always putting herself forward to take\\nplace of mamma  nobody doubts her right to have precedence of mamma\\nbut it would be more becoming in her not to be always insisting on it\\nit is not that mamma cares about it the least in the world\\nbut i know it is taken notice of by many persons\\n\\nhow was anne to set all these matters to rights  she could do little more\\nthan listen patiently soften every grievance and excuse each\\nto the other give them all hints of the forbearance necessary\\nbetween such near neighbours and make those hints broadest\\nwhich were meant for her sisters benefit\\n\\nin all other respects her visit began and proceeded very well\\nher own spirits improved by change of place and subject\\nby being removed three miles from kellynch marys ailments lessened\\nby having a constant companion and their daily intercourse\\nwith the other family since there was neither superior affection\\nconfidence nor employment in the cottage to be interrupted by it\\nwas rather an advantage  it was certainly carried nearly as far as possible\\nfor they met every morning and hardly ever spent an evening asunder\\nbut she believed they should not have done so well without the sight\\nof mr and mrs musgroves respectable forms in the usual places\\nor without the talking laughing and singing of their daughters\\n\\nshe played a great deal better than either of the miss musgroves\\nbut having no voice no knowledge of the harp and no fond parents\\nto sit by and fancy themselves delighted her performance was\\nlittle thought of only out of civility or to refresh the others\\nas she was well aware  she knew that when she played she was\\ngiving pleasure only to herself but this was no new sensation\\nexcepting one short period of her life she had never since the age\\nof fourteen never since the loss of her dear mother known the happiness\\nof being listened to or encouraged by any just appreciation or real taste\\nin music she had been always used to feel alone in the world\\nand mr and mrs musgroves fond partiality for their own daughters\\nperformance and total indifference to any other persons\\ngave her much more pleasure for their sakes than mortification\\nfor her own\\n\\nthe party at the great house was sometimes increased by other company\\nthe neighbourhood was not large but the musgroves were visited\\nby everybody and had more dinnerparties and more callers\\nmore visitors by invitation and by chance than any other family\\nthere were more completely popular\\n\\nthe girls were wild for dancing and the evenings ended occasionally\\nin an unpremeditated little ball  there was a family of cousins\\nwithin a walk of uppercross in less affluent circumstances\\nwho depended on the musgroves for all their pleasures  they would come\\nat any time and help play at anything or dance anywhere and anne\\nvery much preferring the office of musician to a more active post\\nplayed country dances to them by the hour together a kindness which\\nalways recommended her musical powers to the notice of mr and mrs musgrove\\nmore than anything else and often drew this compliment\\nwell done miss anne very well done indeed  lord bless me\\nhow those little fingers of yours fly about\\n\\nso passed the first three weeks  michaelmas came and now annes heart\\nmust be in kellynch again  a beloved home made over to others\\nall the precious rooms and furniture groves and prospects\\nbeginning to own other eyes and other limbs  she could not\\nthink of much else on the 29th of september and she had this\\nsympathetic touch in the evening from mary who on having occasion\\nto note down the day of the month exclaimed dear me is not this\\nthe day the crofts were to come to kellynch  i am glad i did not\\nthink of it before  how low it makes me\\n\\nthe crofts took possession with true naval alertness and were\\nto be visited  mary deplored the necessity for herself\\nnobody knew how much she should suffer  she should put it off\\nas long as she could but was not easy till she had talked charles\\ninto driving her over on an early day and was in a very animated\\ncomfortable state of imaginary agitation when she came back\\nanne had very sincerely rejoiced in there being no means of her going\\nshe wished however to see the crofts and was glad to be within\\nwhen the visit was returned  they came  the master of the house\\nwas not at home but the two sisters were together and as it chanced\\nthat mrs croft fell to the share of anne while the admiral sat by mary\\nand made himself very agreeable by his goodhumoured notice\\nof her little boys she was well able to watch for a likeness\\nand if it failed her in the features to catch it in the voice\\nor in the turn of sentiment and expression\\n\\nmrs croft though neither tall nor fat had a squareness\\nuprightness and vigour of form which gave importance to her person\\nshe had bright dark eyes good teeth and altogether an agreeable face\\nthough her reddened and weatherbeaten complexion the consequence\\nof her having been almost as much at sea as her husband made her seem to\\nhave lived some years longer in the world than her real eightandthirty\\nher manners were open easy and decided like one who had\\nno distrust of herself and no doubts of what to do without any\\napproach to coarseness however or any want of good humour\\nanne gave her credit indeed for feelings of great consideration\\ntowards herself in all that related to kellynch and it pleased her\\nespecially as she had satisfied herself in the very first half minute\\nin the instant even of introduction that there was not the smallest\\nsymptom of any knowledge or suspicion on mrs crofts side to give a bias\\nof any sort  she was quite easy on that head and consequently\\nfull of strength and courage till for a moment electrified by\\nmrs crofts suddenly saying\\n\\nit was you and not your sister i find that my brother had\\nthe pleasure of being acquainted with when he was in this country\\n\\nanne hoped she had outlived the age of blushing but the age of emotion\\nshe certainly had not\\n\\nperhaps you may not have heard that he is married added mrs croft\\n\\nshe could now answer as she ought and was happy to feel\\nwhen mrs crofts next words explained it to be mr wentworth\\nof whom she spoke that she had said nothing which might not do\\nfor either brother she immediately felt how reasonable it was\\nthat mrs croft should be thinking and speaking of edward\\nand not of frederick and with shame at her own forgetfulness\\napplied herself to the knowledge of their former neighbours\\npresent state with proper interest\\n\\nthe rest was all tranquillity till just as they were moving\\nshe heard the admiral say to mary\\n\\nwe are expecting a brother of mrs crofts here soon i dare say\\nyou know him by name\\n\\nhe was cut short by the eager attacks of the little boys\\nclinging to him like an old friend and declaring he should not go\\nand being too much engrossed by proposals of carrying them away\\nin his coat pockets c to have another moment for finishing\\nor recollecting what he had begun anne was left to persuade herself\\nas well as she could that the same brother must still be in question\\nshe could not however reach such a degree of certainty\\nas not to be anxious to hear whether anything had been said on the subject\\nat the other house where the crofts had previously been calling\\n\\nthe folks of the great house were to spend the evening of this day\\nat the cottage and it being now too late in the year for such visits\\nto be made on foot the coach was beginning to be listened for\\nwhen the youngest miss musgrove walked in  that she was coming\\nto apologize and that they should have to spend the evening by themselves\\nwas the first black idea and mary was quite ready to be affronted\\nwhen louisa made all right by saying that she only came on foot\\nto leave more room for the harp which was bringing in the carriage\\n\\nand i will tell you our reason she added and all about it\\ni am come on to give you notice that papa and mamma are\\nout of spirits this evening especially mamma she is thinking so much\\nof poor richard  and we agreed it would be best to have the harp\\nfor it seems to amuse her more than the pianoforte  i will tell you\\nwhy she is out of spirits  when the crofts called this morning\\nthey called here afterwards did not they they happened to say\\nthat her brother captain wentworth is just returned to england\\nor paid off or something and is coming to see them almost directly\\nand most unluckily it came into mammas head when they were gone\\nthat wentworth or something very like it was the name of\\npoor richards captain at one time i do not know when or where\\nbut a great while before he died poor fellow  and upon looking over\\nhis letters and things she found it was so and is perfectly sure\\nthat this must be the very man and her head is quite full of it\\nand of poor richard  so we must be as merry as we can that she may not\\nbe dwelling upon such gloomy things\\n\\nthe real circumstances of this pathetic piece of family history were\\nthat the musgroves had had the ill fortune of a very troublesome\\nhopeless son and the good fortune to lose him before he reached\\nhis twentieth year that he had been sent to sea because he was stupid\\nand unmanageable on shore that he had been very little cared for\\nat any time by his family though quite as much as he deserved\\nseldom heard of and scarcely at all regretted when the intelligence\\nof his death abroad had worked its way to uppercross two years before\\n\\nhe had in fact though his sisters were now doing all they could for him\\nby calling him poor richard been nothing better than a thickheaded\\nunfeeling unprofitable dick musgrove who had never done anything\\nto entitle himself to more than the abbreviation of his name\\nliving or dead\\n\\nhe had been several years at sea and had in the course of those removals\\nto which all midshipmen are liable and especially such midshipmen\\nas every captain wishes to get rid of been six months on board\\ncaptain frederick wentworths frigate the laconia and from the laconia\\nhe had under the influence of his captain written the only two letters\\nwhich his father and mother had ever received from him during the whole\\nof his absence that is to say the only two disinterested letters\\nall the rest had been mere applications for money\\n\\nin each letter he had spoken well of his captain but yet\\nso little were they in the habit of attending to such matters\\nso unobservant and incurious were they as to the names of men or ships\\nthat it had made scarcely any impression at the time and that mrs musgrove\\nshould have been suddenly struck this very day with a recollection\\nof the name of wentworth as connected with her son seemed one of those\\nextraordinary bursts of mind which do sometimes occur\\n\\nshe had gone to her letters and found it all as she supposed\\nand the reperusal of these letters after so long an interval\\nher poor son gone for ever and all the strength of his faults forgotten\\nhad affected her spirits exceedingly and thrown her into\\ngreater grief for him than she had know on first hearing of his death\\nmr musgrove was in a lesser degree affected likewise and when\\nthey reached the cottage they were evidently in want first\\nof being listened to anew on this subject and afterwards\\nof all the relief which cheerful companions could give them\\n\\nto hear them talking so much of captain wentworth repeating his name\\nso often puzzling over past years and at last ascertaining that it might\\nthat it probably would turn out to be the very same captain wentworth\\nwhom they recollected meeting once or twice after their coming back\\nfrom cliftona very fine young manbut they could not say whether\\nit was seven or eight years ago was a new sort of trial to annes nerves\\nshe found however that it was one to which she must inure herself\\nsince he actually was expected in the country she must teach herself\\nto be insensible on such points  and not only did it appear that\\nhe was expected and speedily but the musgroves in their warm gratitude\\nfor the kindness he had shewn poor dick and very high respect\\nfor his character stamped as it was by poor dicks having been\\nsix months under his care and mentioning him in strong\\nthough not perfectly wellspelt praise as a fine dashing felow\\nonly two perticular about the schoolmaster were bent on\\nintroducing themselves and seeking his acquaintance as soon as\\nthey could hear of his arrival\\n\\nthe resolution of doing so helped to form the comfort of their evening\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 7\\n\\n\\na very few days more and captain wentworth was known to be at kellynch\\nand mr musgrove had called on him and come back warm in his praise\\nand he was engaged with the crofts to dine at uppercross\\nby the end of another week  it had been a great disappointment\\nto mr musgrove to find that no earlier day could be fixed\\nso impatient was he to shew his gratitude by seeing captain wentworth\\nunder his own roof and welcoming him to all that was strongest\\nand best in his cellars  but a week must pass only a week\\nin annes reckoning and then she supposed they must meet\\nand soon she began to wish that she could feel secure even for a week\\n\\ncaptain wentworth made a very early return to mr musgroves civility\\nand she was all but calling there in the same half hour\\nshe and mary were actually setting forward for the great house\\nwhere as she afterwards learnt they must inevitably have found him\\nwhen they were stopped by the eldest boys being at that moment\\nbrought home in consequence of a bad fall  the childs situation\\nput the visit entirely aside but she could not hear of her escape\\nwith indifference even in the midst of the serious anxiety\\nwhich they afterwards felt on his account\\n\\nhis collarbone was found to be dislocated and such injury\\nreceived in the back as roused the most alarming ideas\\nit was an afternoon of distress and anne had every thing to do at once\\nthe apothecary to send for the father to have pursued and informed\\nthe mother to support and keep from hysterics the servants to control\\nthe youngest child to banish and the poor suffering one to attend\\nand soothe besides sending as soon as she recollected it\\nproper notice to the other house which brought her an accession\\nrather of frightened enquiring companions than of very useful assistants\\n\\nher brothers return was the first comfort he could take best care\\nof his wife and the second blessing was the arrival of the apothecary\\ntill he came and had examined the child their apprehensions were\\nthe worse for being vague they suspected great injury but knew not where\\nbut now the collarbone was soon replaced and though mr robinson\\nfelt and felt and rubbed and looked grave and spoke low words\\nboth to the father and the aunt still they were all to hope the best\\nand to be able to part and eat their dinner in tolerable ease of mind\\nand then it was just before they parted that the two young aunts\\nwere able so far to digress from their nephews state as to give\\nthe information of captain wentworths visit staying five minutes behind\\ntheir father and mother to endeavour to express how perfectly delighted\\nthey were with him how much handsomer how infinitely more agreeable\\nthey thought him than any individual among their male acquaintance\\nwho had been at all a favourite before  how glad they had been\\nto hear papa invite him to stay dinner how sorry when he said\\nit was quite out of his power and how glad again when he had promised\\nin reply to papa and mammas farther pressing invitations to come\\nand dine with them on the morrowactually on the morrow\\nand he had promised it in so pleasant a manner as if he felt\\nall the motive of their attention just as he ought  and in short\\nhe had looked and said everything with such exquisite grace\\nthat they could assure them all their heads were both turned by him\\nand off they ran quite as full of glee as of love and apparently\\nmore full of captain wentworth than of little charles\\n\\nthe same story and the same raptures were repeated when the two girls came\\nwith their father through the gloom of the evening to make enquiries\\nand mr musgrove no longer under the first uneasiness about his heir\\ncould add his confirmation and praise and hope there would be now\\nno occasion for putting captain wentworth off and only be sorry to think\\nthat the cottage party probably would not like to leave the little boy\\nto give him the meeting  oh no as to leaving the little boy\\nboth father and mother were in much too strong and recent alarm\\nto bear the thought and anne in the joy of the escape\\ncould not help adding her warm protestations to theirs\\n\\ncharles musgrove indeed afterwards shewed more of inclination\\nthe child was going on so well and he wished so much to be introduced\\nto captain wentworth that perhaps he might join them in the evening\\nhe would not dine from home but he might walk in for half an hour\\nbut in this he was eagerly opposed by his wife with oh no indeed\\ncharles i cannot bear to have you go away  only think if anything\\nshould happen\\n\\nthe child had a good night and was going on well the next day\\nit must be a work of time to ascertain that no injury had been\\ndone to the spine but mr robinson found nothing to increase alarm\\nand charles musgrove began consequently to feel no necessity\\nfor longer confinement  the child was to be kept in bed and amused\\nas quietly as possible but what was there for a father to do\\nthis was quite a female case and it would be highly absurd in him\\nwho could be of no use at home to shut himself up  his father\\nvery much wished him to meet captain wentworth and there being\\nno sufficient reason against it he ought to go and it ended in his\\nmaking a bold public declaration when he came in from shooting\\nof his meaning to dress directly and dine at the other house\\n\\nnothing can be going on better than the child said he\\nso i told my father just now that i would come and he thought me\\nquite right  your sister being with you my love i have no scruple at all\\nyou would not like to leave him yourself but you see i can be of no use\\nanne will send for me if anything is the matter\\n\\nhusbands and wives generally understand when opposition will be vain\\nmary knew from charless manner of speaking that he was\\nquite determined on going and that it would be of no use to teaze him\\nshe said nothing therefore till he was out of the room\\nbut as soon as there was only anne to hear\\n\\nso you and i are to be left to shift by ourselves with this\\npoor sick child and not a creature coming near us all the evening\\ni knew how it would be  this is always my luck  if there is\\nanything disagreeable going on men are always sure to get out of it\\nand charles is as bad as any of them  very unfeeling  i must say\\nit is very unfeeling of him to be running away from his poor little boy\\ntalks of his being going on so well  how does he know that he is\\ngoing on well or that there may not be a sudden change half an hour hence\\ni did not think charles would have been so unfeeling  so here he is to\\ngo away and enjoy himself and because i am the poor mother\\ni am not to be allowed to stir and yet i am sure i am more unfit\\nthan anybody else to be about the child  my being the mother\\nis the very reason why my feelings should not be tried  i am not at all\\nequal to it  you saw how hysterical i was yesterday\\n\\nbut that was only the effect of the suddenness of your alarm\\nof the shock  you will not be hysterical again  i dare say we shall have\\nnothing to distress us  i perfectly understand mr robinsons directions\\nand have no fears and indeed mary i cannot wonder at your husband\\nnursing does not belong to a man it is not his province\\na sick child is always the mothers property  her own feelings\\ngenerally make it so\\n\\ni hope i am as fond of my child as any mother but i do not know\\nthat i am of any more use in the sickroom than charles\\nfor i cannot be always scolding and teazing the poor child when it is ill\\nand you saw this morning that if i told him to keep quiet\\nhe was sure to begin kicking about  i have not nerves\\nfor the sort of thing\\n\\nbut could you be comfortable yourself to be spending\\nthe whole evening away from the poor boy\\n\\nyes you see his papa can and why should not i  jemima is so careful\\nand she could send us word every hour how he was  i really think\\ncharles might as well have told his father we would all come\\ni am not more alarmed about little charles now than he is\\ni was dreadfully alarmed yesterday but the case is very different today\\n\\nwell if you do not think it too late to give notice for yourself\\nsuppose you were to go as well as your husband  leave little charles\\nto my care  mr and mrs musgrove cannot think it wrong while i remain\\nwith him\\n\\nare you serious cried mary her eyes brightening  dear me\\nthats a very good thought very good indeed  to be sure\\ni may just as well go as not for i am of no use at homeam i\\nand it only harasses me  you who have not a mothers feelings\\nare a great deal the properest person  you can make little charles\\ndo anything he always minds you at a word  it will be a great deal better\\nthan leaving him only with jemima  oh i shall certainly go\\ni am sure i ought if i can quite as much as charles for they want me\\nexcessively to be acquainted with captain wentworth and i know\\nyou do not mind being left alone  an excellent thought of yours\\nindeed anne  i will go and tell charles and get ready directly\\nyou can send for us you know at a moments notice if anything\\nis the matter but i dare say there will be nothing to alarm you\\ni should not go you may be sure if i did not feel quite at ease\\nabout my dear child\\n\\nthe next moment she was tapping at her husbands dressingroom door\\nand as anne followed her up stairs she was in time for\\nthe whole conversation which began with marys saying\\nin a tone of great exultation\\n\\ni mean to go with you charles for i am of no more use at home\\nthan you are  if i were to shut myself up for ever with the child\\ni should not be able to persuade him to do anything he did not like\\nanne will stay anne undertakes to stay at home and take care of him\\nit is annes own proposal and so i shall go with you which will be\\na great deal better for i have not dined at the other house since tuesday\\n\\nthis is very kind of anne was her husbands answer and i should be\\nvery glad to have you go but it seems rather hard that she should be\\nleft at home by herself to nurse our sick child\\n\\nanne was now at hand to take up her own cause and the sincerity\\nof her manner being soon sufficient to convince him where conviction\\nwas at least very agreeable he had no farther scruples as to her being\\nleft to dine alone though he still wanted her to join them in the evening\\nwhen the child might be at rest for the night and kindly urged her\\nto let him come and fetch her but she was quite unpersuadable\\nand this being the case she had ere long the pleasure of seeing them\\nset off together in high spirits  they were gone she hoped\\nto be happy however oddly constructed such happiness might seem\\nas for herself she was left with as many sensations of comfort\\nas were perhaps ever likely to be hers  she knew herself to be\\nof the first utility to the child and what was it to her\\nif frederick wentworth were only half a mile distant making himself\\nagreeable to others\\n\\nshe would have liked to know how he felt as to a meeting\\nperhaps indifferent if indifference could exist under such circumstances\\nhe must be either indifferent or unwilling  had he wished\\never to see her again he need not have waited till this time\\nhe would have done what she could not but believe that in his place\\nshe should have done long ago when events had been early giving him\\nthe independence which alone had been wanting\\n\\nher brother and sister came back delighted with their new acquaintance\\nand their visit in general  there had been music singing\\ntalking laughing all that was most agreeable charming manners\\nin captain wentworth no shyness or reserve they seemed all\\nto know each other perfectly and he was coming the very next morning\\nto shoot with charles  he was to come to breakfast but not at the cottage\\nthough that had been proposed at first but then he had been pressed\\nto come to the great house instead and he seemed afraid of being\\nin mrs charles musgroves way on account of the child and therefore\\nsomehow they hardly knew how it ended in charless being to meet him\\nto breakfast at his fathers\\n\\nanne understood it  he wished to avoid seeing her  he had inquired\\nafter her she found slightly as might suit a former slight acquaintance\\nseeming to acknowledge such as she had acknowledged actuated perhaps\\nby the same view of escaping introduction when they were to meet\\n\\nthe morning hours of the cottage were always later than those\\nof the other house and on the morrow the difference was so great\\nthat mary and anne were not more than beginning breakfast when\\ncharles came in to say that they were just setting off that he was\\ncome for his dogs that his sisters were following with captain wentworth\\nhis sisters meaning to visit mary and the child and captain wentworth\\nproposing also to wait on her for a few minutes if not inconvenient\\nand though charles had answered for the childs being in no such state\\nas could make it inconvenient captain wentworth would not be satisfied\\nwithout his running on to give notice\\n\\nmary very much gratified by this attention was delighted to receive him\\nwhile a thousand feelings rushed on anne of which this was\\nthe most consoling that it would soon be over  and it was soon over\\nin two minutes after charless preparation the others appeared\\nthey were in the drawingroom  her eye half met captain wentworths\\na bow a curtsey passed she heard his voice he talked to mary\\nsaid all that was right said something to the miss musgroves\\nenough to mark an easy footing the room seemed full full of persons\\nand voices but a few minutes ended it  charles shewed himself\\nat the window all was ready their visitor had bowed and was gone\\nthe miss musgroves were gone too suddenly resolving to walk\\nto the end of the village with the sportsmen  the room was cleared\\nand anne might finish her breakfast as she could\\n\\nit is over it is over she repeated to herself again and again\\nin nervous gratitude  the worst is over\\n\\nmary talked but she could not attend  she had seen him\\nthey had met  they had been once more in the same room\\n\\nsoon however she began to reason with herself and try to be feeling less\\neight years almost eight years had passed since all had been given up\\nhow absurd to be resuming the agitation which such an interval\\nhad banished into distance and indistinctness  what might not\\neight years do  events of every description changes alienations\\nremovalsall all must be comprised in it and oblivion of the past\\nhow natural how certain too  it included nearly a third part\\nof her own life\\n\\nalas with all her reasoning she found that to retentive feelings\\neight years may be little more than nothing\\n\\nnow how were his sentiments to be read  was this like\\nwishing to avoid her  and the next moment she was hating herself\\nfor the folly which asked the question\\n\\non one other question which perhaps her utmost wisdom\\nmight not have prevented she was soon spared all suspense\\nfor after the miss musgroves had returned and finished their visit\\nat the cottage she had this spontaneous information from mary \\n\\ncaptain wentworth is not very gallant by you anne though he was\\nso attentive to me  henrietta asked him what he thought of you\\nwhen they went away and he said you were so altered he should not\\nhave known you again\\n\\nmary had no feelings to make her respect her sisters in a common way\\nbut she was perfectly unsuspicious of being inflicting any peculiar wound\\n\\naltered beyond his knowledge  anne fully submitted in silent\\ndeep mortification  doubtless it was so and she could take no revenge\\nfor he was not altered or not for the worse  she had already\\nacknowledged it to herself and she could not think differently\\nlet him think of her as he would  no  the years which had destroyed\\nher youth and bloom had only given him a more glowing manly\\nopen look in no respect lessening his personal advantages\\nshe had seen the same frederick wentworth\\n\\nso altered that he should not have known her again  these were words\\nwhich could not but dwell with her  yet she soon began to rejoice\\nthat she had heard them  they were of sobering tendency\\nthey allayed agitation they composed and consequently must\\nmake her happier\\n\\nfrederick wentworth had used such words or something like them\\nbut without an idea that they would be carried round to her\\nhe had thought her wretchedly altered and in the first moment of appeal\\nhad spoken as he felt  he had not forgiven anne elliot\\nshe had used him ill deserted and disappointed him and worse\\nshe had shewn a feebleness of character in doing so which his own decided\\nconfident temper could not endure  she had given him up to oblige others\\nit had been the effect of overpersuasion  it had been\\nweakness and timidity\\n\\nhe had been most warmly attached to her and had never seen a woman since\\nwhom he thought her equal but except from some natural sensation\\nof curiosity he had no desire of meeting her again  her power with him\\nwas gone for ever\\n\\nit was now his object to marry  he was rich and being turned on shore\\nfully intended to settle as soon as he could be properly tempted\\nactually looking round ready to fall in love with all the speed\\nwhich a clear head and a quick taste could allow  he had a heart\\nfor either of the miss musgroves if they could catch it a heart\\nin short for any pleasing young woman who came in his way\\nexcepting anne elliot  this was his only secret exception\\nwhen he said to his sister in answer to her suppositions\\n\\nyes here i am sophia quite ready to make a foolish match\\nanybody between fifteen and thirty may have me for asking\\na little beauty and a few smiles and a few compliments to the navy\\nand i am a lost man  should not this be enough for a sailor\\nwho has had no society among women to make him nice\\n\\nhe said it she knew to be contradicted  his bright proud eye\\nspoke the conviction that he was nice and anne elliot was\\nnot out of his thoughts when he more seriously described\\nthe woman he should wish to meet with  a strong mind\\nwith sweetness of manner made the first and the last of the description\\n\\nthat is the woman i want said he  something a little inferior\\ni shall of course put up with but it must not be much  if i am a fool\\ni shall be a fool indeed for i have thought on the subject\\nmore than most men\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 8\\n\\n\\nfrom this time captain wentworth and anne elliot were repeatedly\\nin the same circle  they were soon dining in company together\\nat mr musgroves for the little boys state could no longer\\nsupply his aunt with a pretence for absenting herself and this was\\nbut the beginning of other dinings and other meetings\\n\\nwhether former feelings were to be renewed must be brought to the proof\\nformer times must undoubtedly be brought to the recollection of each\\nthey could not but be reverted to the year of their engagement\\ncould not but be named by him in the little narratives or descriptions\\nwhich conversation called forth  his profession qualified him\\nhis disposition lead him to talk and that was in the year six\\nthat happened before i went to sea in the year six occurred\\nin the course of the first evening they spent together\\nand though his voice did not falter and though she had no reason\\nto suppose his eye wandering towards her while he spoke\\nanne felt the utter impossibility from her knowledge of his mind\\nthat he could be unvisited by remembrance any more than herself\\nthere must be the same immediate association of thought\\nthough she was very far from conceiving it to be of equal pain\\n\\nthey had no conversation together no intercourse but what\\nthe commonest civility required  once so much to each other\\nnow nothing  there had been a time when of all the large party\\nnow filling the drawingroom at uppercross they would have found it\\nmost difficult to cease to speak to one another  with the exception\\nperhaps of admiral and mrs croft who seemed particularly attached\\nand happy anne could allow no other exceptions even among\\nthe married couples there could have been no two hearts so open\\nno tastes so similar no feelings so in unison no countenances so beloved\\nnow they were as strangers nay worse than strangers for they could\\nnever become acquainted  it was a perpetual estrangement\\n\\nwhen he talked she heard the same voice and discerned the same mind\\nthere was a very general ignorance of all naval matters throughout the party\\nand he was very much questioned and especially by the two miss musgroves\\nwho seemed hardly to have any eyes but for him as to the manner\\nof living on board daily regulations food hours c and their surprise\\nat his accounts at learning the degree of accommodation and arrangement\\nwhich was practicable drew from him some pleasant ridicule\\nwhich reminded anne of the early days when she too had been ignorant\\nand she too had been accused of supposing sailors to be living on board\\nwithout anything to eat or any cook to dress it if there were\\nor any servant to wait or any knife and fork to use\\n\\nfrom thus listening and thinking she was roused by a whisper\\nof mrs musgroves who overcome by fond regrets could not help saying\\n\\nah miss anne if it had pleased heaven to spare my poor son\\ni dare say he would have been just such another by this time\\n\\nanne suppressed a smile and listened kindly while mrs musgrove\\nrelieved her heart a little more and for a few minutes therefore\\ncould not keep pace with the conversation of the others\\n\\nwhen she could let her attention take its natural course again\\nshe found the miss musgroves just fetching the navy list\\ntheir own navy list the first that had ever been at uppercross\\nand sitting down together to pore over it with the professed view\\nof finding out the ships that captain wentworth had commanded\\n\\nyour first was the asp i remember we will look for the asp\\n\\nyou will not find her there  quite worn out and broken up\\ni was the last man who commanded her  hardly fit for service then\\nreported fit for home service for a year or two and so i was sent off\\nto the west indies\\n\\nthe girls looked all amazement\\n\\nthe admiralty he continued entertain themselves now and then\\nwith sending a few hundred men to sea in a ship not fit to be employed\\nbut they have a great many to provide for and among the thousands\\nthat may just as well go to the bottom as not it is impossible\\nfor them to distinguish the very set who may be least missed\\n\\nphoo phoo cried the admiral what stuff these young fellows talk\\nnever was a better sloop than the asp in her day  for an old built sloop\\nyou would not see her equal  lucky fellow to get her  he knows there\\nmust have been twenty better men than himself applying for her\\nat the same time  lucky fellow to get anything so soon\\nwith no more interest than his\\n\\ni felt my luck admiral i assure you replied captain wentworth\\nseriously  i was as well satisfied with my appointment as you can desire\\nit was a great object with me at that time to be at sea\\na very great object i wanted to be doing something\\n\\nto be sure you did  what should a young fellow like you do ashore\\nfor half a year together  if a man had not a wife he soon wants\\nto be afloat again\\n\\nbut captain wentworth cried louisa how vexed you must have been\\nwhen you came to the asp to see what an old thing they had given you\\n\\ni knew pretty well what she was before that day said he smiling\\ni had no more discoveries to make than you would have as to\\nthe fashion and strength of any old pelisse which you had seen\\nlent about among half your acquaintance ever since you could remember\\nand which at last on some very wet day is lent to yourself\\nah she was a dear old asp to me  she did all that i wanted\\ni knew she would  i knew that we should either go to the bottom together\\nor that she would be the making of me and i never had two days\\nof foul weather all the time i was at sea in her and after\\ntaking privateers enough to be very entertaining i had the good luck\\nin my passage home the next autumn to fall in with the very french frigate\\ni wanted  i brought her into plymouth and here another instance of luck\\nwe had not been six hours in the sound when a gale came on\\nwhich lasted four days and nights and which would have done for\\npoor old asp in half the time our touch with the great nation\\nnot having much improved our condition  fourandtwenty hours later\\nand i should only have been a gallant captain wentworth\\nin a small paragraph at one corner of the newspapers and being lost\\nin only a sloop nobody would have thought about me annes shudderings\\nwere to herself alone but the miss musgroves could be as open\\nas they were sincere in their exclamations of pity and horror\\n\\nand so then i suppose said mrs musgrove in a low voice\\nas if thinking aloud so then he went away to the laconia and there\\nhe met with our poor boy charles my dear beckoning him to her\\ndo ask captain wentworth where it was he first met with your poor brother\\ni always forgot\\n\\nit was at gibraltar mother i know  dick had been left ill at gibraltar\\nwith a recommendation from his former captain to captain wentworth\\n\\noh but charles tell captain wentworth he need not be afraid\\nof mentioning poor dick before me for it would be rather a pleasure\\nto hear him talked of by such a good friend\\n\\ncharles being somewhat more mindful of the probabilities of the case\\nonly nodded in reply and walked away\\n\\nthe girls were now hunting for the laconia and captain wentworth\\ncould not deny himself the pleasure of taking the precious volume\\ninto his own hands to save them the trouble and once more read aloud\\nthe little statement of her name and rate and present\\nnoncommissioned class observing over it that she too had been\\none of the best friends man ever had\\n\\nah those were pleasant days when i had the laconia  how fast i\\nmade money in her  a friend of mine and i had such a lovely cruise\\ntogether off the western islands  poor harville sister\\nyou know how much he wanted money  worse than myself  he had a wife\\nexcellent fellow  i shall never forget his happiness  he felt it all\\nso much for her sake  i wished for him again the next summer\\nwhen i had still the same luck in the mediterranean\\n\\nand i am sure sir said mrs musgrove it was a lucky day for us\\nwhen you were put captain into that ship  we shall never forget\\nwhat you did\\n\\nher feelings made her speak low and captain wentworth\\nhearing only in part and probably not having dick musgrove at all\\nnear his thoughts looked rather in suspense and as if waiting for more\\n\\nmy brother whispered one of the girls mamma is thinking\\nof poor richard\\n\\npoor dear fellow continued mrs musgrove he was grown so steady\\nand such an excellent correspondent while he was under your care\\nah it would have been a happy thing if he had never left you\\ni assure you captain wentworth we are very sorry he ever left you\\n\\nthere was a momentary expression in captain wentworths face at this speech\\na certain glance of his bright eye and curl of his handsome mouth\\nwhich convinced anne that instead of sharing in mrs musgroves kind wishes\\nas to her son he had probably been at some pains to get rid of him\\nbut it was too transient an indulgence of selfamusement to be detected\\nby any who understood him less than herself in another moment\\nhe was perfectly collected and serious and almost instantly afterwards\\ncoming up to the sofa on which she and mrs musgrove were sitting\\ntook a place by the latter and entered into conversation with her\\nin a low voice about her son doing it with so much sympathy\\nand natural grace as shewed the kindest consideration for all\\nthat was real and unabsurd in the parents feelings\\n\\nthey were actually on the same sofa for mrs musgrove had\\nmost readily made room for him they were divided only by mrs musgrove\\nit was no insignificant barrier indeed  mrs musgrove was of\\na comfortable substantial size infinitely more fitted by nature\\nto express good cheer and good humour than tenderness and sentiment\\nand while the agitations of annes slender form and pensive face\\nmay be considered as very completely screened captain wentworth\\nshould be allowed some credit for the selfcommand with which\\nhe attended to her large fat sighings over the destiny of a son\\nwhom alive nobody had cared for\\n\\npersonal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary proportions\\na large bulky figure has as good a right to be in deep affliction\\nas the most graceful set of limbs in the world  but fair or not fair\\nthere are unbecoming conjunctions which reason will patronize in vain\\nwhich taste cannot toleratewhich ridicule will seize\\n\\nthe admiral after taking two or three refreshing turns about the room\\nwith his hands behind him being called to order by his wife\\nnow came up to captain wentworth and without any observation\\nof what he might be interrupting thinking only of his own thoughts\\nbegan with\\n\\nif you had been a week later at lisbon last spring frederick\\nyou would have been asked to give a passage to lady mary grierson\\nand her daughters\\n\\nshould i  i am glad i was not a week later then\\n\\nthe admiral abused him for his want of gallantry  he defended himself\\nthough professing that he would never willingly admit any ladies\\non board a ship of his excepting for a ball or a visit\\nwhich a few hours might comprehend\\n\\nbut if i know myself said he this is from no want of gallantry\\ntowards them  it is rather from feeling how impossible it is\\nwith all ones efforts and all ones sacrifices to make\\nthe accommodations on board such as women ought to have\\nthere can be no want of gallantry admiral in rating the claims of women\\nto every personal comfort high and this is what i do  i hate to hear\\nof women on board or to see them on board and no ship under my command\\nshall ever convey a family of ladies anywhere if i can help it\\n\\nthis brought his sister upon him\\n\\noh frederick  but i cannot believe it of you all idle refinement\\nwomen may be as comfortable on board as in the best house in england\\ni believe i have lived as much on board as most women and i know\\nnothing superior to the accommodations of a manofwar  i declare\\ni have not a comfort or an indulgence about me even at kellynch hall\\nwith a kind bow to anne beyond what i always had in most of\\nthe ships i have lived in and they have been five altogether\\n\\nnothing to the purpose replied her brother  you were living\\nwith your husband and were the only woman on board\\n\\nbut you yourself brought mrs harville her sister her cousin\\nand three children round from portsmouth to plymouth  where was this\\nsuperfine extraordinary sort of gallantry of yours then\\n\\nall merged in my friendship sophia  i would assist any\\nbrother officers wife that i could and i would bring anything\\nof harvilles from the worlds end if he wanted it  but do not imagine\\nthat i did not feel it an evil in itself\\n\\ndepend upon it they were all perfectly comfortable\\n\\ni might not like them the better for that perhaps  such a number\\nof women and children have no right to be comfortable on board\\n\\nmy dear frederick you are talking quite idly  pray what would\\nbecome of us poor sailors wives who often want to be conveyed to\\none port or another after our husbands if everybody had your feelings\\n\\nmy feelings you see did not prevent my taking mrs harville\\nand all her family to plymouth\\n\\nbut i hate to hear you talking so like a fine gentleman\\nand as if women were all fine ladies instead of rational creatures\\nwe none of us expect to be in smooth water all our days\\n\\nah my dear said the admiral when he had got a wife\\nhe will sing a different tune  when he is married if we have\\nthe good luck to live to another war we shall see him do as you and i\\nand a great many others have done  we shall have him very thankful\\nto anybody that will bring him his wife\\n\\nay that we shall\\n\\nnow i have done cried captain wentworth  when once married\\npeople begin to attack me withoh you will think very differently\\nwhen you are married  i can only say no i shall not and then\\nthey say again yes you will and there is an end of it\\n\\nhe got up and moved away\\n\\nwhat a great traveller you must have been maam said mrs musgrove\\nto mrs croft\\n\\npretty well maam in the fifteen years of my marriage\\nthough many women have done more  i have crossed the atlantic\\nfour times and have been once to the east indies and back again\\nand only once besides being in different places about home\\ncork and lisbon and gibraltar  but i never went beyond the streights\\nand never was in the west indies  we do not call bermuda or bahama\\nyou know the west indies\\n\\nmrs musgrove had not a word to say in dissent she could not accuse herself\\nof having ever called them anything in the whole course of her life\\n\\nand i do assure you maam pursued mrs croft that nothing can exceed\\nthe accommodations of a manofwar i speak you know of the higher rates\\nwhen you come to a frigate of course you are more confined\\nthough any reasonable woman may be perfectly happy in one of them\\nand i can safely say that the happiest part of my life has been spent\\non board a ship  while we were together you know there was nothing\\nto be feared  thank god  i have always been blessed with\\nexcellent health and no climate disagrees with me  a little disordered\\nalways the first twentyfour hours of going to sea but never knew\\nwhat sickness was afterwards  the only time i ever really suffered\\nin body or mind the only time that i ever fancied myself unwell\\nor had any ideas of danger was the winter that i passed by myself at deal\\nwhen the admiral captain croft then was in the north seas\\ni lived in perpetual fright at that time and had all manner of\\nimaginary complaints from not knowing what to do with myself\\nor when i should hear from him next but as long as we could be together\\nnothing ever ailed me and i never met with the smallest inconvenience\\n\\naye to be sure  yes indeed oh yes  i am quite of your opinion\\nmrs croft was mrs musgroves hearty answer  there is nothing so bad\\nas a separation  i am quite of your opinion  i know what it is\\nfor mr musgrove always attends the assizes and i am so glad when\\nthey are over and he is safe back again\\n\\nthe evening ended with dancing  on its being proposed\\nanne offered her services as usual and though her eyes would sometimes\\nfill with tears as she sat at the instrument she was extremely glad\\nto be employed and desired nothing in return but to be unobserved\\n\\nit was a merry joyous party and no one seemed in higher spirits\\nthan captain wentworth  she felt that he had every thing to elevate\\nhim which general attention and deference and especially the attention\\nof all the young women could do  the miss hayters the females\\nof the family of cousins already mentioned were apparently admitted\\nto the honour of being in love with him and as for henrietta and louisa\\nthey both seemed so entirely occupied by him that nothing but\\nthe continued appearance of the most perfect goodwill between themselves\\ncould have made it credible that they were not decided rivals\\nif he were a little spoilt by such universal such eager admiration\\nwho could wonder\\n\\nthese were some of the thoughts which occupied anne while her fingers\\nwere mechanically at work proceeding for half an hour together\\nequally without error and without consciousness  once she felt\\nthat he was looking at herself  observing her altered features\\nperhaps trying to trace in them the ruins of the face which had once\\ncharmed him and once she knew that he must have spoken of her\\nshe was hardly aware of it till she heard the answer but then she was\\nsure of his having asked his partner whether miss elliot never danced\\nthe answer was oh no never she has quite given up dancing\\nshe had rather play  she is never tired of playing  once too\\nhe spoke to her  she had left the instrument on the dancing being over\\nand he had sat down to try to make out an air which he wished\\nto give the miss musgroves an idea of  unintentionally she returned\\nto that part of the room he saw her and instantly rising\\nsaid with studied politeness\\n\\ni beg your pardon madam this is your seat and though she immediately\\ndrew back with a decided negative he was not to be induced\\nto sit down again\\n\\nanne did not wish for more of such looks and speeches\\nhis cold politeness his ceremonious grace were worse than anything\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 9\\n\\n\\ncaptain wentworth was come to kellynch as to a home to stay\\nas long as he liked being as thoroughly the object of\\nthe admirals fraternal kindness as of his wifes  he had intended\\non first arriving to proceed very soon into shropshire\\nand visit the brother settled in that country but the attractions\\nof uppercross induced him to put this off  there was so much\\nof friendliness and of flattery and of everything most bewitching\\nin his reception there the old were so hospitable the young so agreeable\\nthat he could not but resolve to remain where he was and take all\\nthe charms and perfections of edwards wife upon credit a little longer\\n\\nit was soon uppercross with him almost every day  the musgroves\\ncould hardly be more ready to invite than he to come particularly\\nin the morning when he had no companion at home for the admiral\\nand mrs croft were generally out of doors together interesting themselves\\nin their new possessions their grass and their sheep and dawdling about\\nin a way not endurable to a third person or driving out in a gig\\nlately added to their establishment\\n\\nhitherto there had been but one opinion of captain wentworth\\namong the musgroves and their dependencies  it was unvarying\\nwarm admiration everywhere but this intimate footing was not more\\nthan established when a certain charles hayter returned among them\\nto be a good deal disturbed by it and to think captain wentworth\\nvery much in the way\\n\\ncharles hayter was the eldest of all the cousins and a very amiable\\npleasing young man between whom and henrietta there had been\\na considerable appearance of attachment previous to captain wentworths\\nintroduction  he was in orders and having a curacy in the neighbourhood\\nwhere residence was not required lived at his fathers house\\nonly two miles from uppercross  a short absence from home\\nhad left his fair one unguarded by his attentions at this critical period\\nand when he came back he had the pain of finding very altered manners\\nand of seeing captain wentworth\\n\\nmrs musgrove and mrs hayter were sisters  they had each had money\\nbut their marriages had made a material difference in\\ntheir degree of consequence  mr hayter had some property of his own\\nbut it was insignificant compared with mr musgroves and while\\nthe musgroves were in the first class of society in the country\\nthe young hayters would from their parents inferior retired\\nand unpolished way of living and their own defective education\\nhave been hardly in any class at all but for their connexion\\nwith uppercross this eldest son of course excepted who had chosen\\nto be a scholar and a gentleman and who was very superior\\nin cultivation and manners to all the rest\\n\\nthe two families had always been on excellent terms there being no pride\\non one side and no envy on the other and only such a consciousness\\nof superiority in the miss musgroves as made them pleased\\nto improve their cousins  charless attentions to henrietta\\nhad been observed by her father and mother without any disapprobation\\nit would not be a great match for her but if henrietta liked him\\nand henrietta did seem to like him\\n\\nhenrietta fully thought so herself before captain wentworth came\\nbut from that time cousin charles had been very much forgotten\\n\\nwhich of the two sisters was preferred by captain wentworth was\\nas yet quite doubtful as far as annes observation reached\\nhenrietta was perhaps the prettiest louisa had the higher spirits\\nand she knew not now whether the more gentle or the more lively character\\nwere most likely to attract him\\n\\nmr and mrs musgrove either from seeing little or from\\nan entire confidence in the discretion of both their daughters\\nand of all the young men who came near them seemed to leave everything\\nto take its chance  there was not the smallest appearance of solicitude\\nor remark about them in the mansionhouse but it was different\\nat the cottage  the young couple there were more disposed\\nto speculate and wonder and captain wentworth had not been above\\nfour or five times in the miss musgroves company and charles hayter\\nhad but just reappeared when anne had to listen to the opinions\\nof her brother and sister as to which was the one liked best\\ncharles gave it for louisa mary for henrietta but quite agreeing\\nthat to have him marry either could be extremely delightful\\n\\ncharles had never seen a pleasanter man in his life and from what\\nhe had once heard captain wentworth himself say was very sure that\\nhe had not made less than twenty thousand pounds by the war\\nhere was a fortune at once besides which there would be the chance\\nof what might be done in any future war and he was sure captain wentworth\\nwas as likely a man to distinguish himself as any officer in the navy\\noh it would be a capital match for either of his sisters\\n\\nupon my word it would replied mary  dear me  if he should\\nrise to any very great honours  if he should ever be made a baronet\\nlady wentworth sounds very well  that would be a noble thing\\nindeed for henrietta  she would take place of me then and henrietta\\nwould not dislike that  sir frederick and lady wentworth\\nit would be but a new creation however and i never think much\\nof your new creations\\n\\nit suited mary best to think henrietta the one preferred\\non the very account of charles hayter whose pretensions she wished\\nto see put an end to  she looked down very decidedly upon the hayters\\nand thought it would be quite a misfortune to have the existing connection\\nbetween the families renewedvery sad for herself and her children\\n\\nyou know said she i cannot think him at all a fit match for henrietta\\nand considering the alliances which the musgroves have made\\nshe has no right to throw herself away  i do not think any young woman\\nhas a right to make a choice that may be disagreeable and inconvenient\\nto the principal part of her family and be giving bad connections\\nto those who have not been used to them  and pray who is charles hayter\\nnothing but a country curate  a most improper match for miss musgrove\\nof uppercross\\n\\nher husband however would not agree with her here for besides having\\na regard for his cousin charles hayter was an eldest son\\nand he saw things as an eldest son himself\\n\\nnow you are taking nonsense mary was therefore his answer\\nit would not be a great match for henrietta but charles has\\na very fair chance through the spicers of getting something from\\nthe bishop in the course of a year or two and you will please to remember\\nthat he is the eldest son whenever my uncle dies he steps into very\\npretty property  the estate at winthrop is not less than\\ntwo hundred and fifty acres besides the farm near taunton\\nwhich is some of the best land in the country  i grant you\\nthat any of them but charles would be a very shocking match for henrietta\\nand indeed it could not be he is the only one that could be possible\\nbut he is a very goodnatured good sort of a fellow and whenever winthrop\\ncomes into his hands he will make a different sort of place of it\\nand live in a very different sort of way and with that property\\nhe will never be a contemptible mangood freehold property  no no\\nhenrietta might do worse than marry charles hayter and if she has him\\nand louisa can get captain wentworth i shall be very well satisfied\\n\\ncharles may say what he pleases cried mary to anne as soon as\\nhe was out of the room but it would be shocking to have henrietta\\nmarry charles hayter a very bad thing for her and still worse\\nfor me and therefore it is very much to be wished that captain wentworth\\nmay soon put him quite out of her head and i have very little doubt\\nthat he has  she took hardly any notice of charles hayter yesterday\\ni wish you had been there to see her behaviour  and as to\\ncaptain wentworths liking louisa as well as henrietta it is nonsense\\nto say so for he certainly does like henrietta a great deal the best\\nbut charles is so positive  i wish you had been with us yesterday\\nfor then you might have decided between us and i am sure you\\nwould have thought as i did unless you had been determined\\nto give it against me\\n\\na dinner at mr musgroves had been the occasion when all these things\\nshould have been seen by anne but she had staid at home\\nunder the mixed plea of a headache of her own and some return\\nof indisposition in little charles  she had thought only of avoiding\\ncaptain wentworth but an escape from being appealed to as umpire\\nwas now added to the advantages of a quiet evening\\n\\nas to captain wentworths views she deemed it of more consequence\\nthat he should know his own mind early enough not to be endangering\\nthe happiness of either sister or impeaching his own honour\\nthan that he should prefer henrietta to louisa or louisa to henrietta\\neither of them would in all probability make him an affectionate\\ngoodhumoured wife  with regard to charles hayter she had delicacy\\nwhich must be pained by any lightness of conduct in a wellmeaning\\nyoung woman and a heart to sympathize in any of the sufferings\\nit occasioned but if henrietta found herself mistaken in the nature\\nof her feelings the alternation could not be understood too soon\\n\\ncharles hayter had met with much to disquiet and mortify him\\nin his cousins behaviour  she had too old a regard for him\\nto be so wholly estranged as might in two meetings extinguish\\nevery past hope and leave him nothing to do but to keep away\\nfrom uppercross  but there was such a change as became very alarming\\nwhen such a man as captain wentworth was to be regarded as\\nthe probable cause  he had been absent only two sundays\\nand when they parted had left her interested even to the height\\nof his wishes in his prospect of soon quitting his present curacy\\nand obtaining that of uppercross instead  it had then seemed the object\\nnearest her heart that dr shirley the rector who for more than\\nforty years had been zealously discharging all the duties of his office\\nbut was now growing too infirm for many of them should be quite fixed\\non engaging a curate should make his curacy quite as good\\nas he could afford and should give charles hayter the promise of it\\nthe advantage of his having to come only to uppercross instead of going\\nsix miles another way of his having in every respect a better curacy\\nof his belonging to their dear dr shirley and of dear good dr shirleys\\nbeing relieved from the duty which he could no longer get through\\nwithout most injurious fatigue had been a great deal even to louisa\\nbut had been almost everything to henrietta  when he came back alas\\nthe zeal of the business was gone by  louisa could not listen at all\\nto his account of a conversation which he had just held with dr shirley\\nshe was at a window looking out for captain wentworth and even henrietta\\nhad at best only a divided attention to give and seemed to have forgotten\\nall the former doubt and solicitude of the negotiation\\n\\nwell i am very glad indeed  but i always thought you would have it\\ni always thought you sure  it did not appear to me thatin short\\nyou know dr shirley must have a curate and you had secured his promise\\nis he coming louisa\\n\\none morning very soon after the dinner at the musgroves\\nat which anne had not been present captain wentworth walked into\\nthe drawingroom at the cottage where were only herself and the little\\ninvalid charles who was lying on the sofa\\n\\nthe surprise of finding himself almost alone with anne elliot\\ndeprived his manners of their usual composure  he started\\nand could only say i thought the miss musgroves had been here\\nmrs musgrove told me i should find them here before he walked\\nto the window to recollect himself and feel how he ought to behave\\n\\nthey are up stairs with my sister  they will be down in a few moments\\ni dare say had been annes reply in all the confusion that was natural\\nand if the child had not called her to come and do something for him\\nshe would have been out of the room the next moment and released\\ncaptain wentworth as well as herself\\n\\nhe continued at the window and after calmly and politely saying\\ni hope the little boy is better was silent\\n\\nshe was obliged to kneel down by the sofa and remain there\\nto satisfy her patient and thus they continued a few minutes\\nwhen to her very great satisfaction she heard some other person\\ncrossing the little vestibule  she hoped on turning her head\\nto see the master of the house but it proved to be one\\nmuch less calculated for making matters easycharles hayter\\nprobably not at all better pleased by the sight of captain wentworth\\nthan captain wentworth had been by the sight of anne\\n\\nshe only attempted to say how do you do  will you not sit down\\nthe others will be here presently\\n\\ncaptain wentworth however came from his window apparently\\nnot illdisposed for conversation but charles hayter soon put an end\\nto his attempts by seating himself near the table and taking up\\nthe newspaper and captain wentworth returned to his window\\n\\nanother minute brought another addition  the younger boy\\na remarkable stout forward child of two years old having got the door\\nopened for him by some one without made his determined appearance\\namong them and went straight to the sofa to see what was going on\\nand put in his claim to anything good that might be giving away\\n\\nthere being nothing to eat he could only have some play\\nand as his aunt would not let him tease his sick brother\\nhe began to fasten himself upon her as she knelt in such a way that\\nbusy as she was about charles she could not shake him off\\nshe spoke to him ordered entreated and insisted in vain\\nonce she did contrive to push him away but the boy had\\nthe greater pleasure in getting upon her back again directly\\n\\nwalter said she get down this moment  you are extremely troublesome\\ni am very angry with you\\n\\nwalter cried charles hayter why do you not do as you are bid\\ndo not you hear your aunt speak  come to me walter come to\\ncousin charles\\n\\nbut not a bit did walter stir\\n\\nin another moment however she found herself in the state of\\nbeing released from him some one was taking him from her\\nthough he had bent down her head so much that his little sturdy hands\\nwere unfastened from around her neck and he was resolutely borne away\\nbefore she knew that captain wentworth had done it\\n\\nher sensations on the discovery made her perfectly speechless\\nshe could not even thank him  she could only hang over little charles\\nwith most disordered feelings  his kindness in stepping forward\\nto her relief the manner the silence in which it had passed\\nthe little particulars of the circumstance with the conviction soon\\nforced on her by the noise he was studiously making with the child\\nthat he meant to avoid hearing her thanks and rather sought\\nto testify that her conversation was the last of his wants\\nproduced such a confusion of varying but very painful agitation\\nas she could not recover from till enabled by the entrance of mary\\nand the miss musgroves to make over her little patient to their cares\\nand leave the room  she could not stay  it might have been\\nan opportunity of watching the loves and jealousies of the four\\nthey were now altogether but she could stay for none of it\\nit was evident that charles hayter was not well inclined towards\\ncaptain wentworth  she had a strong impression of his having said\\nin a vext tone of voice after captain wentworths interference\\nyou ought to have minded me walter i told you not to teaze your aunt\\nand could comprehend his regretting that captain wentworth should do\\nwhat he ought to have done himself  but neither charles hayters feelings\\nnor anybodys feelings could interest her till she had a little better\\narranged her own  she was ashamed of herself quite ashamed\\nof being so nervous so overcome by such a trifle but so it was\\nand it required a long application of solitude and reflection\\nto recover her\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 10\\n\\n\\nother opportunities of making her observations could not fail to occur\\nanne had soon been in company with all the four together often enough\\nto have an opinion though too wise to acknowledge as much at home\\nwhere she knew it would have satisfied neither husband nor wife\\nfor while she considered louisa to be rather the favourite\\nshe could not but think as far as she might dare to judge from memory\\nand experience that captain wentworth was not in love with either\\nthey were more in love with him yet there it was not love\\nit was a little fever of admiration but it might probably must\\nend in love with some  charles hayter seemed aware of being slighted\\nand yet henrietta had sometimes the air of being divided between them\\nanne longed for the power of representing to them all what they were about\\nand of pointing out some of the evils they were exposing themselves to\\nshe did not attribute guile to any  it was the highest satisfaction\\nto her to believe captain wentworth not in the least aware\\nof the pain he was occasioning  there was no triumph no pitiful triumph\\nin his manner  he had probably never heard and never thought of\\nany claims of charles hayter  he was only wrong in accepting\\nthe attentions for accepting must be the word of two young women at once\\n\\nafter a short struggle however charles hayter seemed to quit the field\\nthree days had passed without his coming once to uppercross\\na most decided change  he had even refused one regular invitation to dinner\\nand having been found on the occasion by mr musgrove with some large books\\nbefore him mr and mrs musgrove were sure all could not be right\\nand talked with grave faces of his studying himself to death\\nit was marys hope and belief that he had received a positive dismissal\\nfrom henrietta and her husband lived under the constant dependence\\nof seeing him tomorrow  anne could only feel that charles hayter\\nwas wise\\n\\none morning about this time charles musgrove and captain wentworth\\nbeing gone ashooting together as the sisters in the cottage\\nwere sitting quietly at work they were visited at the window\\nby the sisters from the mansionhouse\\n\\nit was a very fine november day and the miss musgroves came\\nthrough the little grounds and stopped for no other purpose than to say\\nthat they were going to take a long walk and therefore concluded\\nmary could not like to go with them and when mary immediately replied\\nwith some jealousy at not being supposed a good walker oh yes\\ni should like to join you very much i am very fond of a long walk\\nanne felt persuaded by the looks of the two girls that it was precisely\\nwhat they did not wish and admired again the sort of necessity\\nwhich the family habits seemed to produce of everything being\\nto be communicated and everything being to be done together\\nhowever undesired and inconvenient  she tried to dissuade mary from going\\nbut in vain and that being the case thought it best to accept\\nthe miss musgroves much more cordial invitation to herself to go likewise\\nas she might be useful in turning back with her sister and lessening\\nthe interference in any plan of their own\\n\\ni cannot imagine why they should suppose i should not like a long walk\\nsaid mary as she went up stairs  everybody is always supposing\\nthat i am not a good walker and yet they would not have been pleased\\nif we had refused to join them  when people come in this manner\\non purpose to ask us how can one say no\\n\\njust as they were setting off the gentlemen returned  they had taken out\\na young dog who had spoilt their sport and sent them back early\\ntheir time and strength and spirits were therefore exactly ready\\nfor this walk and they entered into it with pleasure  could anne\\nhave foreseen such a junction she would have staid at home but\\nfrom some feelings of interest and curiosity she fancied now that it was\\ntoo late to retract and the whole six set forward together\\nin the direction chosen by the miss musgroves who evidently\\nconsidered the walk as under their guidance\\n\\nannes object was not to be in the way of anybody and where\\nthe narrow paths across the fields made many separations necessary\\nto keep with her brother and sister  her pleasure in the walk\\nmust arise from the exercise and the day from the view of\\nthe last smiles of the year upon the tawny leaves and withered hedges\\nand from repeating to herself some few of the thousand poetical\\ndescriptions extant of autumn that season of peculiar and\\ninexhaustible influence on the mind of taste and tenderness\\nthat season which had drawn from every poet worthy of being read\\nsome attempt at description or some lines of feeling\\nshe occupied her mind as much as possible in such like musings\\nand quotations but it was not possible that when within reach\\nof captain wentworths conversation with either of the miss musgroves\\nshe should not try to hear it yet she caught little very remarkable\\nit was mere lively chat such as any young persons on an intimate footing\\nmight fall into  he was more engaged with louisa than with henrietta\\nlouisa certainly put more forward for his notice than her sister\\nthis distinction appeared to increase and there was one speech\\nof louisas which struck her  after one of the many praises of the day\\nwhich were continually bursting forth captain wentworth added \\n\\nwhat glorious weather for the admiral and my sister  they meant to take\\na long drive this morning perhaps we may hail them from\\nsome of these hills  they talked of coming into this side of the country\\ni wonder whereabouts they will upset today  oh it does happen\\nvery often i assure you but my sister makes nothing of it\\nshe would as lieve be tossed out as not\\n\\nah you make the most of it i know cried louisa but if it were\\nreally so i should do just the same in her place  if i loved a man\\nas she loves the admiral i would always be with him nothing should ever\\nseparate us and i would rather be overturned by him than driven safely\\nby anybody else\\n\\nit was spoken with enthusiasm\\n\\nhad you cried he catching the same tone i honour you\\nand there was silence between them for a little while\\n\\nanne could not immediately fall into a quotation again  the sweet scenes\\nof autumn were for a while put by unless some tender sonnet\\nfraught with the apt analogy of the declining year with declining\\nhappiness and the images of youth and hope and spring all gone together\\nblessed her memory  she roused herself to say as they struck by order\\ninto another path is not this one of the ways to winthrop\\nbut nobody heard or at least nobody answered her\\n\\nwinthrop however or its environsfor young men are sometimes\\nto be met with strolling about near homewas their destination\\nand after another half mile of gradual ascent through large enclosures\\nwhere the ploughs at work and the fresh made path spoke the farmer\\ncounteracting the sweets of poetical despondence and meaning\\nto have spring again they gained the summit of the most considerable hill\\nwhich parted uppercross and winthrop and soon commanded a full view\\nof the latter at the foot of the hill on the other side\\n\\nwinthrop without beauty and without dignity was stretched before them\\nan indifferent house standing low and hemmed in by the barns and\\nbuildings of a farmyard\\n\\nmary exclaimed bless me here is winthrop  i declare i had no idea\\nwell now i think we had better turn back i am excessively tired\\n\\nhenrietta conscious and ashamed and seeing no cousin charles\\nwalking along any path or leaning against any gate was ready\\nto do as mary wished but no said charles musgrove and no no\\ncried louisa more eagerly and taking her sister aside seemed to be\\narguing the matter warmly\\n\\ncharles in the meanwhile was very decidedly declaring his resolution\\nof calling on his aunt now that he was so near and very evidently\\nthough more fearfully trying to induce his wife to go too\\nbut this was one of the points on which the lady shewed her strength\\nand when he recommended the advantage of resting herself a quarter\\nof an hour at winthrop as she felt so tired she resolutely answered\\noh no indeed walking up that hill again would do her more harm\\nthan any sitting down could do her good and in short\\nher look and manner declared that go she would not\\n\\nafter a little succession of these sort of debates and consultations\\nit was settled between charles and his two sisters that he\\nand henrietta should just run down for a few minutes to see their aunt\\nand cousins while the rest of the party waited for them at the top\\nof the hill  louisa seemed the principal arranger of the plan\\nand as she went a little way with them down the hill still talking\\nto henrietta mary took the opportunity of looking scornfully around her\\nand saying to captain wentworth\\n\\nit is very unpleasant having such connexions  but i assure you\\ni have never been in the house above twice in my life\\n\\nshe received no other answer than an artificial assenting smile\\nfollowed by a contemptuous glance as he turned away which anne\\nperfectly knew the meaning of\\n\\nthe brow of the hill where they remained was a cheerful spot\\nlouisa returned and mary finding a comfortable seat for herself\\non the step of a stile was very well satisfied so long as the others\\nall stood about her but when louisa drew captain wentworth away\\nto try for a gleaning of nuts in an adjoining hedgerow\\nand they were gone by degrees quite out of sight and sound\\nmary was happy no longer she quarrelled with her own seat\\nwas sure louisa had got a much better somewhere and nothing could\\nprevent her from going to look for a better also  she turned through\\nthe same gate but could not see them  anne found a nice seat\\nfor her on a dry sunny bank under the hedgerow in which\\nshe had no doubt of their still being in some spot or other\\nmary sat down for a moment but it would not do she was sure louisa\\nhad found a better seat somewhere else and she would go on\\ntill she overtook her\\n\\nanne really tired herself was glad to sit down and she very soon heard\\ncaptain wentworth and louisa in the hedgerow behind her as if\\nmaking their way back along the rough wild sort of channel down the\\ncentre  they were speaking as they drew near  louisas voice was\\nthe first distinguished  she seemed to be in the middle of some\\neager speech  what anne first heard was\\n\\nand so i made her go  i could not bear that she should be frightened\\nfrom the visit by such nonsense  what would i be turned back from\\ndoing a thing that i had determined to do and that i knew to be right\\nby the airs and interference of such a person or of any person i may say\\nno i have no idea of being so easily persuaded  when i have\\nmade up my mind i have made it and henrietta seemed entirely\\nto have made up hers to call at winthrop today and yet she was as near\\ngiving it up out of nonsensical complaisance\\n\\nshe would have turned back then but for you\\n\\nshe would indeed  i am almost ashamed to say it\\n\\nhappy for her to have such a mind as yours at hand  after the hints\\nyou gave just now which did but confirm my own observations\\nthe last time i was in company with him  i need not affect\\nto have no comprehension of what is going on  i see that more than\\na mere dutiful morning visit to your aunt was in question\\nand woe betide him and her too when it comes to things of consequence\\nwhen they are placed in circumstances requiring fortitude and\\nstrength of mind if she have not resolution enough to resist\\nidle interference in such a trifle as this  your sister is\\nan amiable creature but yours is the character of decision and firmness\\ni see  if you value her conduct or happiness infuse as much\\nof your own spirit into her as you can  but this no doubt\\nyou have been always doing  it is the worst evil of too yielding\\nand indecisive a character that no influence over it can be depended on\\nyou are never sure of a good impression being durable everybody\\nmay sway it  let those who would be happy be firm  here is a nut\\nsaid he catching one down from an upper bough  to exemplify\\na beautiful glossy nut which blessed with original strength\\nhas outlived all the storms of autumn  not a puncture not\\na weak spot anywhere  this nut he continued with playful solemnity\\nwhile so many of his brethren have fallen and been trodden under foot\\nis still in possession of all the happiness that a hazel nut can be\\nsupposed capable of  then returning to his former earnest tone\\nmy first wish for all whom i am interested in is that they should be firm\\nif louisa musgrove would be beautiful and happy in her november of life\\nshe will cherish all her present powers of mind\\n\\nhe had done and was unanswered  it would have surprised anne if louisa\\ncould have readily answered such a speech  words of such interest\\nspoken with such serious warmth  she could imagine what louisa was feeling\\nfor herself she feared to move lest she should be seen\\nwhile she remained a bush of low rambling holly protected her\\nand they were moving on  before they were beyond her hearing\\nhowever louisa spoke again\\n\\nmary is goodnatured enough in many respects said she\\nbut she does sometimes provoke me excessively by her nonsense\\nand pridethe elliot pride  she has a great deal too much\\nof the elliot pride  we do so wish that charles had married anne instead\\ni suppose you know he wanted to marry anne\\n\\nafter a moments pause captain wentworth said\\n\\ndo you mean that she refused him\\n\\noh yes certainly\\n\\nwhen did that happen\\n\\ni do not exactly know for henrietta and i were at school at the time\\nbut i believe about a year before he married mary  i wish she had\\naccepted him  we should all have liked her a great deal better\\nand papa and mamma always think it was her great friend\\nlady russells doing that she did not  they think charles\\nmight not be learned and bookish enough to please lady russell\\nand that therefore she persuaded anne to refuse him\\n\\nthe sounds were retreating and anne distinguished no more\\nher own emotions still kept her fixed  she had much to recover from\\nbefore she could move  the listeners proverbial fate was\\nnot absolutely hers she had heard no evil of herself but she had heard\\na great deal of very painful import  she saw how her own character\\nwas considered by captain wentworth and there had been just that degree\\nof feeling and curiosity about her in his manner which must give her\\nextreme agitation\\n\\nas soon as she could she went after mary and having found\\nand walked back with her to their former station by the stile\\nfelt some comfort in their whole party being immediately afterwards\\ncollected and once more in motion together  her spirits wanted\\nthe solitude and silence which only numbers could give\\n\\ncharles and henrietta returned bringing as may be conjectured\\ncharles hayter with them  the minutiae of the business anne\\ncould not attempt to understand even captain wentworth did not seem\\nadmitted to perfect confidence here but that there had been a withdrawing\\non the gentlemans side and a relenting on the ladys and that they\\nwere now very glad to be together again did not admit a doubt\\nhenrietta looked a little ashamed but very well pleased\\ncharles hayter exceedingly happy  and they were devoted to each other\\nalmost from the first instant of their all setting forward for uppercross\\n\\neverything now marked out louisa for captain wentworth\\nnothing could be plainer and where many divisions were necessary\\nor even where they were not they walked side by side nearly as much\\nas the other two  in a long strip of meadow land where there was\\nample space for all they were thus divided forming three distinct parties\\nand to that party of the three which boasted least animation\\nand least complaisance anne necessarily belonged  she joined charles\\nand mary and was tired enough to be very glad of charless other arm\\nbut charles though in very good humour with her was out of temper\\nwith his wife  mary had shewn herself disobliging to him\\nand was now to reap the consequence which consequence was\\nhis dropping her arm almost every moment to cut off the heads\\nof some nettles in the hedge with his switch and when mary began\\nto complain of it and lament her being illused according to custom\\nin being on the hedge side while anne was never incommoded on the other\\nhe dropped the arms of both to hunt after a weasel which he had\\na momentary glance of and they could hardly get him along at all\\n\\nthis long meadow bordered a lane which their footpath at the end of it\\nwas to cross and when the party had all reached the gate of exit\\nthe carriage advancing in the same direction which had been\\nsome time heard was just coming up and proved to be admiral crofts gig\\nhe and his wife had taken their intended drive and were returning home\\nupon hearing how long a walk the young people had engaged in\\nthey kindly offered a seat to any lady who might be particularly tired\\nit would save her a full mile and they were going through uppercross\\nthe invitation was general and generally declined  the miss musgroves\\nwere not at all tired and mary was either offended by not being asked\\nbefore any of the others or what louisa called the elliot pride\\ncould not endure to make a third in a one horse chaise\\n\\nthe walking party had crossed the lane and were surmounting an\\nopposite stile and the admiral was putting his horse in motion again\\nwhen captain wentworth cleared the hedge in a moment to say something\\nto his sister  the something might be guessed by its effects\\n\\nmiss elliot i am sure you are tired cried mrs croft\\ndo let us have the pleasure of taking you home  here is excellent room\\nfor three i assure you  if we were all like you i believe we might\\nsit four  you must indeed you must\\n\\nanne was still in the lane and though instinctively beginning to decline\\nshe was not allowed to proceed  the admirals kind urgency\\ncame in support of his wifes they would not be refused\\nthey compressed themselves into the smallest possible space\\nto leave her a corner and captain wentworth without saying a word\\nturned to her and quietly obliged her to be assisted into the carriage\\n\\nyes he had done it  she was in the carriage and felt that he had\\nplaced her there that his will and his hands had done it\\nthat she owed it to his perception of her fatigue and his resolution\\nto give her rest  she was very much affected by the view of\\nhis disposition towards her which all these things made apparent\\nthis little circumstance seemed the completion of all that had gone before\\nshe understood him  he could not forgive her but he could not\\nbe unfeeling  though condemning her for the past and considering it\\nwith high and unjust resentment though perfectly careless of her\\nand though becoming attached to another still he could not see her suffer\\nwithout the desire of giving her relief  it was a remainder\\nof former sentiment it was an impulse of pure though unacknowledged\\nfriendship it was a proof of his own warm and amiable heart\\nwhich she could not contemplate without emotions so compounded\\nof pleasure and pain that she knew not which prevailed\\n\\nher answers to the kindness and the remarks of her companions\\nwere at first unconsciously given  they had travelled half their way\\nalong the rough lane before she was quite awake to what they said\\nshe then found them talking of frederick\\n\\nhe certainly means to have one or other of those two girls sophy\\nsaid the admiral but there is no saying which  he has been\\nrunning after them too long enough one would think to make up his mind\\nay this comes of the peace  if it were war now he would have\\nsettled it long ago  we sailors miss elliot cannot afford to make\\nlong courtships in time of war  how many days was it my dear\\nbetween the first time of my seeing you and our sitting down together\\nin our lodgings at north yarmouth\\n\\nwe had better not talk about it my dear replied mrs croft pleasantly\\nfor if miss elliot were to hear how soon we came to an understanding\\nshe would never be persuaded that we could be happy together\\ni had known you by character however long before\\n\\nwell and i had heard of you as a very pretty girl and what were we\\nto wait for besides  i do not like having such things so long in hand\\ni wish frederick would spread a little more canvass and bring us home\\none of these young ladies to kellynch  then there would always\\nbe company for them  and very nice young ladies they both are\\ni hardly know one from the other\\n\\nvery good humoured unaffected girls indeed said mrs croft\\nin a tone of calmer praise such as made anne suspect that\\nher keener powers might not consider either of them as quite worthy\\nof her brother and a very respectable family  one could not be\\nconnected with better people  my dear admiral that post\\nwe shall certainly take that post\\n\\nbut by coolly giving the reins a better direction herself they happily\\npassed the danger and by once afterwards judiciously putting out\\nher hand they neither fell into a rut nor ran foul of a dungcart\\nand anne with some amusement at their style of driving\\nwhich she imagined no bad representation of the general guidance\\nof their affairs found herself safely deposited by them at the cottage\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 11\\n\\n\\nthe time now approached for lady russells return  the day was even fixed\\nand anne being engaged to join her as soon as she was resettled\\nwas looking forward to an early removal to kellynch and beginning\\nto think how her own comfort was likely to be affected by it\\n\\nit would place her in the same village with captain wentworth\\nwithin half a mile of him they would have to frequent the same church\\nand there must be intercourse between the two families\\nthis was against her but on the other hand he spent so much of his time\\nat uppercross that in removing thence she might be considered rather\\nas leaving him behind than as going towards him and upon the whole\\nshe believed she must on this interesting question be the gainer\\nalmost as certainly as in her change of domestic society\\nin leaving poor mary for lady russell\\n\\nshe wished it might be possible for her to avoid ever seeing\\ncaptain wentworth at the hall  those rooms had witnessed\\nformer meetings which would be brought too painfully before her\\nbut she was yet more anxious for the possibility of lady russell and\\ncaptain wentworth never meeting anywhere  they did not like each other\\nand no renewal of acquaintance now could do any good and were lady russell\\nto see them together she might think that he had too much selfpossession\\nand she too little\\n\\nthese points formed her chief solicitude in anticipating\\nher removal from uppercross where she felt she had been stationed\\nquite long enough  her usefulness to little charles would always\\ngive some sweetness to the memory of her two months visit there\\nbut he was gaining strength apace and she had nothing else to stay for\\n\\nthe conclusion of her visit however was diversified in a way\\nwhich she had not at all imagined  captain wentworth after being unseen\\nand unheard of at uppercross for two whole days appeared again among them\\nto justify himself by a relation of what had kept him away\\n\\na letter from his friend captain harville having found him out at last\\nhad brought intelligence of captain harvilles being settled\\nwith his family at lyme for the winter of their being therefore\\nquite unknowingly within twenty miles of each other  captain harville\\nhad never been in good health since a severe wound which he received\\ntwo years before and captain wentworths anxiety to see him\\nhad determined him to go immediately to lyme  he had been there\\nfor fourandtwenty hours  his acquittal was complete\\nhis friendship warmly honoured a lively interest excited for his friend\\nand his description of the fine country about lyme so feelingly attended to\\nby the party that an earnest desire to see lyme themselves\\nand a project for going thither was the consequence\\n\\nthe young people were all wild to see lyme  captain wentworth talked\\nof going there again himself it was only seventeen miles from uppercross\\nthough november the weather was by no means bad and in short\\nlouisa who was the most eager of the eager having formed\\nthe resolution to go and besides the pleasure of doing as she liked\\nbeing now armed with the idea of merit in maintaining her own way\\nbore down all the wishes of her father and mother for putting it off\\ntill summer and to lyme they were to gocharles mary anne henrietta\\nlouisa and captain wentworth\\n\\nthe first heedless scheme had been to go in the morning and return at night\\nbut to this mr musgrove for the sake of his horses would not consent\\nand when it came to be rationally considered a day in\\nthe middle of november would not leave much time for seeing a new place\\nafter deducting seven hours as the nature of the country required\\nfor going and returning  they were consequently to stay the night there\\nand not to be expected back till the next days dinner  this was felt\\nto be a considerable amendment and though they all met at the great house\\nat rather an early breakfast hour and set off very punctually\\nit was so much past noon before the two carriages mr musgroves coach\\ncontaining the four ladies and charless curricle in which\\nhe drove captain wentworth were descending the long hill into lyme\\nand entering upon the still steeper street of the town itself\\nthat it was very evident they would not have more than time\\nfor looking about them before the light and warmth of the day were gone\\n\\nafter securing accommodations and ordering a dinner at one of the inns\\nthe next thing to be done was unquestionably to walk directly\\ndown to the sea  they were come too late in the year for any amusement\\nor variety which lyme as a public place might offer  the rooms\\nwere shut up the

almost hurrying into the water the walk to the cobb\\nskirting round the pleasant little bay which in the season\\nis animated with bathing machines and company the cobb itself\\nits old wonders and new improvements with the very beautiful\\nline of cliffs stretching out to the east of the town are what\\nthe strangers eye will seek and a very strange stranger it must be\\nwho does not see charms

retired bay backed by dark cliffs\\nwhere fragments of low rock among the sands make it the happiest spot\\nfor watching the flow of the tide for sitting in unwearied contemplation\\nthe woody varieties of the cheerful village of up lyme and above all\\npinny with its green chasms between romantic rocks where\\nthe scattered forest trees and orchards of luxuriant growth\\ndeclare that many a generation must have passed away since the first\\npartial falling of the cliff prepared the ground for such a state\\nwhere a scene so wonderful and so lovely is exhibited as may\\nmore than equal

now deserted\\nand melancholy looking rooms and still descending soon found themselves\\non the seashore and lingering only as all must linger and gaze\\non a first return to the sea who ever deserved to look on it at all\\nproceeded towards the cobb equally their object in itself\\nand on captain wentworths account  for in a small house\\nnear the foot of an old pier of unknown date were the harvilles settled\\ncaptain wentworth turned in to call on his friend the others walked on\\nand he was to join them on the cobb\\n\\nthey were by no means tired of wondering and admiring and not even louisa\\nseemed to feel that they had parted with captain wentworth long\\nwhen they saw him coming after them with three companions\\nall well known already by description to be captain and mrs harville\\nand a captain benwick who was staying with them\\n\\ncaptain benwick had some time ago been first lieutenant of the laconia\\nand the account which captain wentworth had given of him\\non his return from lyme before his warm praise of him as\\nan excellent young man and an officer whom he had always valued highly\\nwhich must have stamped him well in the esteem of every listener\\nhad been followed by a little history of his private life\\nwhich rendered him perfectly interesting in the eyes of all the ladies\\nhe had been engaged to captain harvilles sister and was now\\nmourning her loss  they had been a year or two waiting for fortune\\nand promotion  fortune came his prizemoney as lieutenant being great\\npromotion too came at last but fanny harville did not live to know it\\nshe had died the preceding summer while he was at sea  captain wentworth\\nbelieved it impossible for man to be more attached to woman\\nthan poor benwick had been to fanny harville or to be more deeply\\nafflicted under the dreadful change  he considered his disposition\\nas of the sort which must suffer heavily uniting very strong feelings\\nwith quiet serious and retiring manners and a decided taste for reading\\nand sedentary pursuits  to finish the interest of the story\\nthe friendship between him and the harvilles seemed if possible\\naugmented by the event which closed all their views of alliance\\nand captain benwick was now living with them entirely  captain harville\\nhad taken his present house for half a year his taste and his health\\nand his fortune all directing him to a residence inexpensive\\nand by the sea and the grandeur of the country and the retirement\\nof lyme in the winter appeared exactly adapted to captain benwicks\\nstate of mind  the sympathy and goodwill excited towards captain benwick\\nwas very great\\n\\nand yet said anne to herself as they now moved forward\\nto meet the party he has not perhaps a more sorrowing heart\\nthan i have  i cannot believe his prospects so blighted for ever\\nhe is younger than i am younger in feeling if not in fact\\nyounger as a man  he will rally again and be happy with another\\n\\nthey all met and were introduced  captain harville was a tall\\ndark man with a sensible benevolent countenance a little lame\\nand from strong features and want of health looking much older\\nthan captain wentworth  captain benwick looked and was\\nthe youngest of the three and compared with either of them\\na little man  he had a pleasing face and a melancholy air\\njust as he ought to have and drew back from conversation\\n\\ncaptain harville though not equalling captain wentworth in manners\\nwas a perfect gentleman unaffected warm and obliging\\nmrs harville a degree less polished than her husband seemed however\\nto have the same good feelings and nothing could be more pleasant\\nthan their desire of considering the whole party as friends of their own\\nbecause the friends of captain wentworth or more kindly hospitable\\nthan their entreaties for their all promising to dine with them\\nthe dinner already ordered at the inn was at last though unwillingly\\naccepted as a excuse but they seemed almost hurt that captain wentworth\\nshould have brought any such party to lyme without considering it\\nas a thing of course that they should dine with them\\n\\nthere was so much attachment to captain wentworth in all this\\nand such a bewitching charm in a degree of hospitality so uncommon\\nso unlike the usual style of giveandtake invitations and dinners\\nof formality and display that anne felt her spirits not likely to be\\nbenefited by an increasing acquaintance among his brotherofficers\\nthese would have been all my friends was her thought\\nand she had to struggle against a great tendency to lowness\\n\\non quitting the cobb they all went indoors with their new friends\\nand found rooms so small as none but those who invite from the heart\\ncould think capable of

herself by this time growing so much more hardened\\nto being in captain wentworths company than she had at first imagined\\ncould ever be that the sitting down to the same table with him now\\nand

wentworth and harville led the talk on one side of the room\\nand by recurring to former days supplied anecdotes in abundance\\nto occupy and entertain the others it fell to annes lot to be placed\\nrather apart with captain benwick and a very good impulse\\nof her nature obliged her to begin an acquaintance with him\\nhe was shy and disposed to abstraction but the engaging mildness of\\nher countenance and gentleness of her manners soon had their effect\\nand anne was well repaid the first trouble of exertion\\nhe was evidently a young man of considerable taste in reading\\nthough principally in poetry and besides the persuasion of having\\ngiven him at least an evenings indulgence in the discussion of subjects\\nwhich his usual companions had probably no concern in she had the hope\\nof being of real use to him in some suggestions as to the duty and\\nbenefit of struggling against affliction which had naturally grown out\\nof their conversation  for though shy he did not seem reserved\\nit had rather the appearance of feelings glad to burst their\\nusual restraints and having talked of poetry the richness of\\nthe present age and gone through a brief comparison of opinion\\nas to the firstrate poets trying to ascertain whether marmion\\nor the lady of the lake were to be preferred and how ranked the giaour\\nand the bride of abydos and moreover how the giaour was to be pronounced\\nhe showed himself so intimately acquainted with all the tenderest songs\\nof the one poet and all the impassioned descriptions of hopeless agony\\nof the other he repeated with such tremulous feeling the various lines\\nwhich imaged a broken heart or a mind destroyed by wretchedness\\nand looked so entirely as if he meant to be understood\\nthat she ventured to hope he did not always read only poetry\\nand to say that she thought it was the misfortune of poetry to be\\nseldom safely enjoyed by those who enjoyed it completely\\nand that the strong feelings which alone could estimate it truly\\nwere the very feelings which ought to taste it but sparingly\\n\\nhis looks shewing him not pained but pleased with this allusion\\nto his situation she was emboldened to go on and feeling in herself\\nthe right of seniority of mind she ventured to recommend\\na larger allowance of prose in his daily study and on being requested\\nto particularize

fortify the mind by the highest precepts\\nand the strongest examples of moral and religious endurances\\n\\ncaptain benwick listened attentively and seemed grateful for\\nthe interest implied and

read them\\n\\nwhen the evening was over anne could not but be amused at the idea\\nof her coming to lyme to preach patience and resignation to a young man\\nwhom she had never seen before nor could

during this speech\\nand entered into the subject as ready to do good by entering into\\nthe feelings of a young lady as of a young man though here it was good\\nof a lower standard for what could be offered but general acquiescence\\nshe said all that was reasonable and proper on the business\\nfelt the claims of dr shirley to repose as she ought saw how very\\ndesirable it was that he should have some active respectable young man\\nas a resident curate and was even courteous enough to hint at\\nthe advantage of such resident curates being married\\n\\ni wish said henrietta very well pleased with her companion\\ni wish lady russell lived at uppercross and were intimate\\nwith dr shirley  i have always heard of lady russell as a woman of\\nthe greatest influence with everybody  i always look upon her as able\\nto persuade a person to anything  i am afraid of her as i have\\ntold you before quite afraid of her because she is so very clever\\nbut i respect her amazingly and wish we had such a neighbour\\nat uppercross\\n\\nanne was amused by henriettas manner of being grateful\\nand amused also that the course of events and the new interests\\nof henriettas views should have placed her friend at all in favour\\nwith any of the musgrove family she had only time however\\nfor a general answer and a wish that such another woman\\nwere at uppercross before all subjects suddenly ceased\\non seeing louisa and captain wentworth coming towards them\\nthey came also for a stroll till breakfast was likely to be ready\\nbut louisa recollecting immediately afterwards that she had something\\nto procure at a shop invited them all to go back with her into the town\\nthey were all at her disposal\\n\\nwhen they came to the steps leading upwards from the beach a gentleman\\nat the same moment preparing to come down politely drew back\\nand stopped to give them way  they ascended and passed him\\nand as they passed annes face caught his eye and he looked at her\\nwith a degree of earnest admiration which she could not be insensible of\\nshe was looking remarkably well her very regular very pretty features\\nhaving the bloom and freshness of youth restored by the fine wind\\nwhich had been blowing on her complexion and by the animation of eye\\nwhich it had also produced  it was evident that the gentleman\\ncompletely a gentleman in manner admired her exceedingly\\ncaptain wentworth looked round at her instantly in a way which\\nshewed his noticing of it  he gave her a momentary glance\\na glance of brightness which seemed to say that man is struck with you\\nand even i at this moment see something like anne elliot again\\n\\nafter attending louisa through her business and loitering about\\na little longer they returned to the inn and anne in passing afterwards\\nquickly from her own chamber to their diningroom had nearly run against\\nthe very same gentleman as he came out of an adjoining apartment\\nshe had before conjectured him to be a stranger like themselves\\nand determined that a welllooking groom who was strolling about\\nnear the two inns as they came back should be his servant\\nboth master and man being in mourning assisted the idea\\nit was now proved that he belonged to the same inn as themselves\\nand this second meeting short as it was also proved again\\nby the gentlemans looks that he thought hers very lovely\\nand by the readiness and propriety of his apologies that he was\\na man of exceedingly good manners  he seemed about thirty\\nand though not handsome had an agreeable person  anne felt that\\nshe should like to know who he was\\n\\nthey had nearly done breakfast when the sound of a carriage\\nalmost the first they had heard since entering lyme drew half the party\\nto the window  it was a gentlemans carriage a curricle\\nbut only coming round from the stableyard to the front door\\nsomebody must be going away  it was driven by a servant in mourning\\n\\nthe word curricle made charles musgrove jump up that he might\\ncompare it with his own the servant in mourning roused annes curiosity\\nand the whole six were collected to look by the time the owner\\nof the curricle was to be seen issuing from the door amidst the bows\\nand civilities of the household and taking his seat to drive off\\n\\nah cried captain wentworth instantly and with half a glance at anne\\nit is the very man we passed\\n\\nthe miss musgroves agreed to it and having all kindly watched him\\nas far up the hill as they could they returned to the breakfast table\\nthe waiter came into the room soon afterwards\\n\\npray said captain wentworth immediately can you tell us the name\\nof the gentleman who is just gone away\\n\\nyes sir a mr elliot a gentleman of large fortune came in last night\\nfrom sidmouth  dare say you heard the carriage sir while you were\\nat dinner and going on now for crewkherne in his way to bath\\nand london\\n\\nelliot  many had looked on each other and many had repeated the name\\nbefore all this had been got through even by the smart rapidity\\nof a waiter\\n\\nbless me cried mary it must be our cousin it must be our mr elliot\\nit must indeed  charles anne must not it  in mourning you see\\njust as our mr elliot must be  how very extraordinary\\nin the very same inn with us  anne must not it be our mr elliot\\nmy fathers next heir  pray sir turning to the waiter\\ndid not you hear did not his servant say whether he belonged\\nto the kellynch family\\n\\nno maam he did not mention no particular family but he said\\nhis master was a very rich gentleman and would be a baronight some day\\n\\nthere you see cried mary in an ecstasy just as i said\\nheir to sir walter elliot  i was sure that would come out\\nif it was so  depend upon it that is a circumstance which his servants\\ntake care to publish wherever he goes  but anne only conceive\\nhow extraordinary  i wish i had looked at him more  i wish we had\\nbeen aware in time who it was that he might have been introduced to us\\nwhat a pity that we should not have been introduced to each other\\ndo you think he had the elliot countenance  i hardly looked at him\\ni was looking at the horses but i think he had something\\nof the elliot countenance i wonder the arms did not strike me\\noh the greatcoat was hanging over the panel and hid the arms\\nso it did otherwise i am sure i should have observed them\\nand the livery too if the servant had not been in mourning\\none should have known him by the livery\\n\\nputting all these very extraordinary circumstances together\\nsaid captain wentworth we must consider it to be the arrangement\\nof providence that you should not be introduced to your cousin\\n\\nwhen she could command marys attention anne quietly tried\\nto convince her that their father and mr elliot had not for many years\\nbeen on such terms as to make the power of attempting an introduction\\nat all desirable\\n\\nat the same time however it was a secret gratification to herself\\nto have seen her cousin and to know that the future owner of kellynch\\nwas undoubtedly a gentleman and had an air of good sense\\nshe would not upon any account mention her having met with him\\nthe second time luckily mary did not much attend to their having\\npassed close by him in their earlier walk but she would have felt\\nquite illused by annes having actually run against him in the passage\\nand received his very polite excuses while she had never been\\nnear him at all no that cousinly little interview must remain\\na perfect secret\\n\\nof course said mary you will mention our seeing mr elliot\\nthe next time you write to bath  i think my father certainly\\nought to hear of it do mention all about him\\n\\nanne avoided a direct reply but it was just the circumstance\\nwhich she considered as not merely unnecessary to be communicated\\nbut as what ought to be suppressed  the offence which had been given\\nher father many years back she knew elizabeths particular share in it\\nshe suspected and that mr elliots idea always produced irritation in both\\nwas beyond a doubt  mary never wrote to bath herself all the toil\\nof keeping up a slow and unsatisfactory correspondence with elizabeth\\nfell on anne\\n\\nbreakfast had not been long over when they were joined by captain\\nand mrs harville and captain benwick with whom they had appointed\\nto take their last walk about lyme  they ought to be setting off\\nfor uppercross by one and in the mean while were to be all together\\nand out of doors as long as they could\\n\\nanne found captain benwick getting near her as soon as they were all\\nfairly in the street  their conversation the preceding evening\\ndid not disincline him to seek her again and they walked together\\nsome time talking as before of mr scott and lord byron\\nand still as unable as before and as unable as any other two readers\\nto think exactly alike of the merits of either till something\\noccasioned an almost general change amongst their party and instead of\\ncaptain benwick she had captain harville by her side\\n\\nmiss elliot said he speaking rather low you have done a good deed\\nin making that poor fellow talk so much  i wish he could have\\nsuch company oftener  it is bad for him i know to be shut up as he is\\nbut what can we do  we cannot part\\n\\nno said anne that i can easily believe to be impossible\\nbut in time perhapswe know what time does in every case of affliction\\nand you must remember captain harville that your friend\\nmay yet be called a young mourneronly last summer i understand\\n\\nay true enough with a deep sigh only june\\n\\nand not known to him perhaps so soon\\n\\nnot till the first week of august when he came home from the cape\\njust made into the grappler  i was at plymouth dreading to hear of him\\nhe sent in letters but the grappler was under orders for portsmouth\\nthere the news must follow him but who was to tell it not i\\ni would as soon have been run up to the yardarm  nobody could do it\\nbut that good fellow pointing to captain wentworth  the laconia\\nhad come into plymouth the week before no danger of her\\nbeing sent to sea again  he stood his chance for the rest\\nwrote up for leave of absence but without waiting the return\\ntravelled night and day till he got to portsmouth rowed off\\nto the grappler that instant and never left the poor fellow for a week\\nthats what he did and nobody else could have saved poor james\\nyou may think miss elliot whether he is dear to us\\n\\nanne did think on the question with perfect decision and said as much\\nin reply as her own feeling could accomplish or as his seemed\\nable to bear for he was too much affected to renew the subject\\nand when he spoke again it was of something totally different\\n\\nmrs harvilles giving it as her opinion that her husband would have\\nquite walking enough by the time he reached home determined the direction\\nof all the party in what was to be their last walk they would\\naccompany them to their door and then return and set off themselves\\nby all their calculations there was just time for this but as they drew\\nnear the cobb there was such a general wish to walk along it once more\\nall were so inclined and louisa soon grew so determined\\nthat the difference of a quarter of an hour it was found\\nwould be no difference at all so with all the kind leavetaking\\nand all the kind interchange of invitations and promises which\\nmay be imagined they parted from captain and mrs harville\\nat their own door and still accompanied by captain benwick\\nwho seemed to cling to them to the last proceeded to make\\nthe proper adieus to the cobb\\n\\nanne found captain benwick again drawing near her  lord byrons\\ndark blue seas could not fail of being brought forward by\\ntheir present view and she gladly gave him all her attention as long as\\nattention was possible  it was soon drawn perforce another way\\n\\nthere was too much wind to make the high part of the new cobb pleasant\\nfor the ladies and they agreed to get down the steps to the lower\\nand all were contented to pass quietly and carefully down the steep flight\\nexcepting louisa she must be jumped down them by captain wentworth\\nin all their walks he had had to jump her from the stiles\\nthe sensation was delightful to her  the hardness of the pavement\\nfor her feet made him less willing upon the present occasion\\nhe did it however  she was safely down and instantly\\nto show her enjoyment ran up the steps to be jumped down again\\nhe advised her against it thought the jar too great but no\\nhe reasoned and talked in vain she smiled and said i am determined\\ni will he put out his hands she was too precipitate by half a second\\nshe fell on the pavement on the lower cobb and was taken up lifeless\\nthere was no wound no blood no visible bruise but her eyes were closed\\nshe breathed not her face was like death  the horror of the moment\\nto all who stood around\\n\\ncaptain wentworth who had caught her up knelt with her in his arms\\nlooking on her with a face as pallid as her own in an agony of silence\\nshe is dead she is dead screamed mary catching hold of her\\nhusband and contributing with his own horror to make him immoveable\\nand in another moment henrietta sinking under the conviction lost\\nher senses too and would have fallen on the steps but for captain\\nbenwick and anne who caught and supported her between them\\n\\nis there no one to help me were the first words which\\nburst from captain wentworth in a tone of despair and as if\\nall his own strength were gone\\n\\ngo to him go to him cried anne for heavens sake go to him\\ni can support her myself  leave me and go to him  rub her hands\\nrub her temples here are salts take them take them\\n\\ncaptain benwick obeyed and charles at the same moment\\ndisengaging himself from his wife they were both with him\\nand louisa was raised up and supported more firmly between them\\nand everything was done that anne had prompted but in vain\\nwhile captain wentworth staggering against the wall for his support\\nexclaimed in the bitterest agony\\n\\noh god her father and mother\\n\\na surgeon said anne\\n\\nhe caught the word it seemed to rouse him at once and saying only\\ntrue true a surgeon this instant was darting away\\nwhen anne eagerly suggested\\n\\ncaptain benwick would not it be better for captain benwick\\nhe knows where a surgeon is to be found\\n\\nevery one capable of thinking felt the advantage of the idea\\nand in a moment it was all done in rapid moments captain benwick had\\nresigned the poor corpselike  figure entirely to the brothers care\\nand was off for the town with the utmost rapidity\\n\\nas to the wretched party left behind it could scarcely be said\\nwhich of the three who were completely rational was suffering most\\ncaptain wentworth anne or charles who really a very affectionate\\nbrother hung over louisa with sobs of grief and could only turn his eyes\\nfrom one sister to see the other in a state as insensible\\nor to witness the hysterical agitations of his wife calling on him\\nfor help which he could not give\\n\\nanne attending with all the strength and zeal and thought\\nwhich instinct supplied to henrietta still tried at intervals\\nto suggest comfort to the others tried to quiet mary to animate charles\\nto assuage the feelings of captain wentworth  both seemed to look to her\\nfor directions\\n\\nanne anne cried charles what is to be done next\\nwhat in heavens name is to be done next\\n\\ncaptain wentworths eyes were also turned towards her\\n\\nhad not she better be carried to the inn  yes i am sure\\ncarry her gently to the inn\\n\\nyes yes to the inn repeated captain wentworth comparatively\\ncollected and eager to be doing something  i will carry her myself\\nmusgrove take care of the others\\n\\nby this time the report of the accident had spread among the workmen\\nand boatmen about the cobb and many were collected near them\\nto be useful if wanted at any rate to enjoy the sight of\\na dead young lady nay two dead young ladies for it proved twice as fine\\nas the first report  to some of the bestlooking of these good people\\nhenrietta was consigned for though partially revived\\nshe was quite helpless and in this manner anne walking by her side\\nand charles attending to his wife they set forward treading back\\nwith feelings unutterable the ground which so lately so very lately\\nand so light of heart they had passed along\\n\\nthey were not off the cobb before the harvilles met them\\ncaptain benwick had been seen flying by their house with a countenance\\nwhich showed something to be wrong and they had set off immediately\\ninformed and directed as they passed towards the spot\\nshocked as captain harville was he brought senses and nerves\\nthat could be instantly useful and a look between him and his wife\\ndecided what was to be done  she must be taken to their house\\nall must go to their house and await the surgeons arrival there\\nthey would not listen to scruples  he was obeyed they were all\\nbeneath his roof and while louisa under mrs harvilles direction\\nwas conveyed up stairs and given possession of her own bed\\nassistance cordials restoratives were supplied by her husband\\nto all who needed them\\n\\nlouisa had once opened her eyes but soon closed them again\\nwithout apparent consciousness  this had been a proof of life\\nhowever of service to her sister and henrietta though perfectly\\nincapable of being in the same room with louisa was kept\\nby the agitation of hope and fear from a return of her own insensibility\\nmary too was growing calmer\\n\\nthe surgeon was with them almost before it had seemed possible\\nthey were sick with horror while he examined but he was not hopeless\\nthe head had received a severe contusion but he had seen greater injuries\\nrecovered from  he was by no means hopeless he spoke cheerfully\\n\\nthat he did not regard it as a desperate case that he did not say\\na few hours must end it was at first felt beyond the hope of most\\nand the ecstasy of such a reprieve the rejoicing deep and silent\\nafter a few fervent ejaculations of gratitude to heaven had been offered\\nmay be conceived\\n\\nthe tone the look with which thank god was uttered\\nby captain wentworth anne was sure could never be forgotten by her\\nnor the sight of him afterwards as he sat near a table leaning over it\\nwith folded arms and face concealed as if overpowered by\\nthe various feelings of his soul and trying by prayer and reflection\\nto calm them\\n\\nlouisas limbs had escaped  there was no injury but to the head\\n\\nit now became necessary for the party to consider what was best to be done\\nas to their general situation  they were now able to speak to each other\\nand consult  that louisa must remain where she was however distressing\\nto her friends to be involving the harvilles in such trouble\\ndid not admit a doubt  her removal was impossible  the harvilles\\nsilenced all scruples and as much as they could all gratitude\\nthey had looked forward and arranged everything before the others\\nbegan to reflect  captain benwick must give up his room to them\\nand get another bed elsewhere and the whole was settled\\nthey were only concerned that the house could accommodate no more\\nand yet perhaps by putting the children away in the maids room\\nor swinging a cot somewhere they could hardly bear to think of not\\nfinding room for two or three besides supposing they might wish to stay\\nthough with regard to any attendance on miss musgrove there need not be\\nthe least uneasiness in leaving her to mrs harvilles care entirely\\nmrs harville was a very experienced nurse and her nurserymaid\\nwho had lived with her long and gone about with her everywhere\\nwas just such another  between these two she could want\\nno possible attendance by day or night  and all this was said\\nwith a truth and sincerity of feeling irresistible\\n\\ncharles henrietta and captain wentworth were the three in consultation\\nand for a little while it was only an interchange of perplexity and terror\\nuppercross the necessity of some ones going to uppercross\\nthe news to be conveyed how it could be broken to mr and mrs musgrove\\nthe lateness of the morning an hour already gone since they\\nought to have been off the impossibility of being in tolerable time\\nat first they were capable of nothing more to the purpose\\nthan such exclamations but after a while captain wentworth\\nexerting himself said\\n\\nwe must be decided and without the loss of another minute\\nevery minute is valuable  some one must resolve on being off\\nfor uppercross instantly  musgrove either you or i must go\\n\\ncharles agreed but declared his resolution of not going away\\nhe would be as little incumbrance as possible to captain and mrs harville\\nbut as to leaving his sister in such a state he neither ought nor would\\nso far it was decided and henrietta at first declared the same\\nshe however was soon persuaded to think differently  the usefulness\\nof her staying  she who had not been able to remain in louisas room\\nor to look at her without sufferings which made her worse than helpless\\nshe was forced to acknowledge that she could do no good\\nyet was still unwilling to be away till touched by the thought\\nof her father and mother she gave it up she consented\\nshe was anxious to be at home\\n\\nthe plan had reached this point when anne coming quietly\\ndown from louisas room could not but hear what followed\\nfor the parlour door was open\\n\\nthen it is settled musgrove cried captain wentworth\\nthat you stay and that i take care of your sister home\\nbut as to the rest as to the others if one stays to assist mrs harville\\ni think it need be only one  mrs charles musgrove will of course\\nwish to get back to her children but if anne will stay no one so proper\\nso capable as anne\\n\\nshe paused a moment to recover from the emotion of hearing herself\\nso spoken of  the other two warmly agreed with what he said\\nand she then appeared\\n\\nyou will stay i am sure you will stay and nurse her cried he\\nturning to her and speaking with a glow and yet a gentleness\\nwhich seemed almost restoring the past  she coloured deeply\\nand he recollected himself and moved away  she expressed herself\\nmost willing ready happy to remain  it was what she had been\\nthinking of and wishing to be allowed to do  a bed on the floor\\nin louisas room would be sufficient for her if mrs harville\\nwould but think so\\n\\none thing more and all seemed arranged  though it was rather desirable\\nthat mr and mrs musgrove should be previously alarmed by some\\nshare of delay yet the time required by the uppercross horses\\nto take them back would be a dreadful extension of suspense\\nand captain wentworth proposed and charles musgrove agreed\\nthat it would be much better for him to take a chaise from the inn\\nand leave mr musgroves carriage and horses to be sent home\\nthe next morning early when there would be the farther advantage\\nof sending an account of louisas night\\n\\ncaptain wentworth now hurried off to get everything ready on his part\\nand to be soon followed by the two ladies  when the plan was\\nmade known to mary however there was an end of all peace in it\\nshe was so wretched and so vehement complained so much of injustice\\nin being expected to go away instead of anne anne who was\\nnothing to louisa while she was her sister and had the best right\\nto stay in henriettas stead  why was not she to be as useful as anne\\nand to go home without charles too without her husband\\nno it was too unkind  and in short she said more than her husband\\ncould long withstand and as none of the others could oppose\\nwhen he gave way there was no help for it the change of mary for anne\\nwas inevitable\\n\\nanne had never submitted more reluctantly to the jealous\\nand illjudging claims of mary but so it must be and they set off\\nfor the town charles taking care of his sister and captain benwick\\nattending to her  she gave a moments recollection as they hurried along\\nto the little circumstances which the same spots had witnessed\\nearlier in the morning  there she had listened to henriettas schemes\\nfor dr shirleys leaving uppercross farther on she had\\nfirst seen mr elliot a moment seemed all that could now be given\\nto any one but louisa or those who were wrapt up in her welfare\\n\\ncaptain benwick was most considerately attentive to her and\\nunited as they all seemed by the distress of the day she felt\\nan increasing degree of goodwill towards him and a pleasure even\\nin thinking that it might perhaps be the occasion of continuing\\ntheir acquaintance\\n\\ncaptain wentworth was on the watch for them and a chaise and four in waiting\\nstationed for their convenience in the lowest part of the street\\nbut his evident surprise and vexation at the substitution of one sister\\nfor the other the change in his countenance the astonishment\\nthe expressions begun and suppressed with which charles was listened to\\nmade but a mortifying reception of anne or must at least convince her\\nthat she was valued only as she could be useful to louisa\\n\\nshe endeavoured to be composed and to be just  without emulating\\nthe feelings of an emma towards her henry she would have\\nattended on louisa with a zeal above the common claims of regard\\nfor his sake and she hoped he would not long be so unjust\\nas to suppose she would shrink unnecessarily from the office of a friend\\n\\nin the mean while she was in the carriage  he had handed them both in\\nand placed himself between them and in this manner under these\\ncircumstances full of astonishment and emotion to anne she quitted lyme\\nhow the long stage would pass how it was to affect their manners\\nwhat was to be their sort of intercourse she could not foresee\\nit was all quite natural however  he was devoted to henrietta\\nalways turning towards her and when he spoke at all always with the view\\nof supporting her hopes and raising her spirits  in general\\nhis voice and manner were studiously calm  to spare henrietta\\nfrom agitation seemed the governing principle  once only\\nwhen she had been grieving over the last illjudged illfated\\nwalk to the cobb bitterly lamenting that it ever had been thought of\\nhe burst forth as if wholly overcome\\n\\ndont talk of it dont talk of it he cried  oh god that i had\\nnot given way to her at the fatal moment  had i done as i ought\\nbut so eager and so resolute dear sweet louisa\\n\\nanne wondered whether it ever occurred to him now to question the justness\\nof his own previous opinion as to the universal felicity and advantage\\nof firmness of character and whether it might not strike him that\\nlike all other qualities of the mind it should have its proportions\\nand limits  she thought it could scarcely escape him to feel\\nthat a persuadable temper might sometimes be as much in favour of happiness\\nas a very resolute character\\n\\nthey got on fast  anne was astonished to recognise the same hills\\nand the same objects so soon  their actual speed heightened by\\nsome dread of the conclusion made the road appear but half as long\\nas on the day before  it was growing quite dusk however\\nbefore they were in the neighbourhood of uppercross and there had been\\ntotal silence among them for some time henrietta leaning back\\nin the corner with a shawl over her face giving the hope of her\\nhaving cried herself to sleep when as they were going up their last hill\\nanne found herself all at once addressed by captain wentworth\\nin a low cautious voice he said \\n\\ni have been considering what we had best do  she must not\\nappear at first  she could not stand it  i have been thinking whether\\nyou had not better remain in the carriage with her while i go in\\nand break it to mr and mrs musgrove  do you think this is a good plan\\n\\nshe did  he was satisfied and said no more  but the remembrance\\nof the appeal remained a pleasure to her as a proof of friendship\\nand of deference for her judgement a great pleasure and when it became\\na sort of parting proof its value did not lessen\\n\\nwhen the distressing communication at uppercross was over\\nand he had seen the father and mother quite as composed as could be hoped\\nand the daughter all the better for being with them he announced\\nhis intention of returning in the same carriage to lyme\\nand when the horses were baited he was off\\n\\nend of volume one\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 13\\n\\n\\nthe remainder of annes time at uppercross comprehending only two days\\nwas spent entirely at the mansion house and she had the satisfaction\\nof knowing herself extremely useful there both as an immediate companion\\nand as assisting in all those arrangements for the future which\\nin mr and mrs musgroves distressed state of spirits would have\\nbeen difficulties\\n\\nthey had an early account from lyme the next morning  louisa was\\nmuch the same  no symptoms worse than before had appeared\\ncharles came a few hours afterwards to bring a later and\\nmore particular account  he was tolerably cheerful  a speedy cure\\nmust not be hoped but everything was going on as well\\nas the nature of the case admitted  in speaking of the harvilles\\nhe seemed unable to satisfy his own sense of their kindness\\nespecially of mrs harvilles exertions as a nurse  she really left\\nnothing for mary to do  he and mary had been persuaded to go early\\nto their inn last night  mary had been hysterical again this morning\\nwhen he came away she was going to walk out with captain benwick\\nwhich he hoped would do her good  he almost wished she had been\\nprevailed on to come home the day before but the truth was\\nthat mrs harville left nothing for anybody to do\\n\\ncharles was to return to lyme the same afternoon and his father\\nhad at first half a mind to go with him but the ladies could not consent\\nit would be going only to multiply trouble to the others\\nand increase his own distress and a much better scheme followed\\nand was acted upon  a chaise was sent for from crewkherne\\nand charles conveyed back a far more useful person in the old nurserymaid\\nof the family one who having brought up all the children\\nand seen the very last the lingering and longpetted master harry\\nsent to school after his brothers was now living in her deserted nursery\\nto mend stockings and dress all the blains and bruises she could\\nget near her and who consequently was only too happy in being\\nallowed to go and help nurse dear miss louisa  vague wishes of\\ngetting sarah thither had occurred before to mrs musgrove and henrietta\\nbut without anne it would hardly have been resolved on\\nand found practicable so soon\\n\\nthey were indebted the next day to charles hayter for all\\nthe minute knowledge of louisa which it was so essential to obtain\\nevery twentyfour hours  he made it his business to go to lyme\\nand his account was still encouraging  the intervals of sense\\nand consciousness were believed to be stronger  every report agreed\\nin captain wentworths appearing fixed in lyme\\n\\nanne was to leave them on the morrow an event which they all dreaded\\nwhat should they do without her  they were wretched comforters\\nfor one another  and so much was said in this way that anne thought\\nshe could not do better than impart among them the general inclination\\nto which she was privy and persuaded them all to go to lyme at once\\nshe had little difficulty it was soon determined that they would go\\ngo tomorrow fix themselves at the inn or get into lodgings\\nas it suited and there remain till dear louisa could be moved\\nthey must be taking off some trouble from the good people she was with\\nthey might at least relieve mrs harville from the care of her own children\\nand in short they were so happy in the decision that anne was delighted\\nwith what she had done and felt that she could not spend her\\nlast morning at uppercross better than in assisting their preparations\\nand sending them off at an early hour though her being left\\nto the solitary range of the house was the consequence\\n\\nshe was the last excepting the little boys at the cottage\\nshe was the very last the only remaining one of all that had filled\\nand animated both houses of all that had given uppercross\\nits cheerful character  a few days had made a change indeed\\n\\nif louisa recovered it would all be well again  more than\\nformer happiness would be restored  there could not be a doubt\\nto her mind there was none of what would follow her recovery\\na few months hence and the room now so deserted occupied but by\\nher silent pensive self might be filled again with all that was happy\\nand gay all that was glowing and bright in prosperous love\\nall that was most unlike anne elliot\\n\\nan hours complete leisure for such reflections as these\\non a dark november day a small thick rain almost blotting out\\nthe very few objects ever to be discerned from the windows was enough\\nto make the sound of lady russells carriage exceedingly welcome\\nand yet though desirous to be gone she could not quit the mansion house\\nor look an adieu to the cottage with its black dripping and\\ncomfortless veranda or even notice through the misty glasses\\nthe last humble tenements of the village without a saddened heart\\nscenes had passed in uppercross which made it precious\\nit stood the record of many sensations of pain once severe\\nbut now softened and of some instances of relenting feeling\\nsome breathings of friendship and reconciliation which could\\nnever be looked for again and which could never cease to be dear\\nshe left it all behind her all but the recollection that\\nsuch things had been\\n\\nanne had never entered kellynch since her quitting lady russells house\\nin september  it had not been necessary and the few occasions of\\nits being possible for her to go to the hall she had contrived to evade\\nand escape from  her first return was to resume her place in the modern\\nand elegant apartments of the lodge and to gladden the eyes\\nof its mistress\\n\\nthere was some anxiety mixed with lady russells joy in meeting her\\nshe knew who had been frequenting uppercross  but happily\\neither anne was improved in plumpness and looks or lady russell\\nfancied her so and anne in receiving her compliments on the occasion\\nhad the amusement of connecting them with the silent admiration\\nof her cousin and of hoping that she was to be blessed with\\na second spring of youth and beauty\\n\\nwhen they came to converse she was soon sensible of some mental change\\nthe subjects of which her heart had been full on leaving kellynch\\nand which she had felt slighted and been compelled to smother\\namong the musgroves were now become but of secondary interest\\nshe had lately lost sight even of her father and sister and bath\\ntheir concerns had been sunk under those of uppercross\\nand when lady russell reverted to their former hopes and fears\\nand spoke her satisfaction in the house in camden place\\nwhich had been taken and her regret that mrs clay should still\\nbe with them anne would have been ashamed to have it known\\nhow much more she was thinking of lyme and louisa musgrove\\nand all her acquaintance there how much more interesting to her\\nwas the home and the friendship of the harvilles and captain benwick\\nthan her own fathers house in camden place or her own sisters intimacy\\nwith mrs clay  she was actually forced to exert herself\\nto meet lady russell with anything like the appearance of equal solicitude\\non topics which had by nature the first claim on her\\n\\nthere was a little awkwardness at first in their discourse\\non another subject  they must speak of the accident at lyme\\nlady russell had not been arrived five minutes the day before\\nwhen a full account of the whole had burst on her but still it must\\nbe talked of she must make enquiries she must regret the imprudence\\nlament the result and captain wentworths name must be mentioned by both\\nanne was conscious of not doing it so well as lady russell\\nshe could not speak the name and look straight forward to\\nlady russells eye till she had adopted the expedient of telling her\\nbriefly what she thought of the attachment between him and louisa\\nwhen this was told his name distressed her no longer\\n\\nlady russell had only to listen composedly and wish them happy\\nbut internally her heart revelled in angry pleasure in pleased contempt\\nthat the man who at twentythree had seemed to understand somewhat\\nof the value of an anne elliot should eight years afterwards\\nbe charmed by a louisa musgrove\\n\\nthe first three or four days passed most quietly with no circumstance\\nto mark them excepting the receipt of a note or two from lyme\\nwhich found their way to anne she could not tell how and brought\\na rather improving account of louisa  at the end of that period\\nlady russells politeness could repose no longer and the fainter\\nselfthreatenings of the past became in a decided tone\\ni must call on mrs croft i really must call upon her soon\\nanne have you courage to go with me and pay a visit in that house\\nit will be some trial to us both\\n\\nanne did not shrink from it on the contrary she truly felt as she said\\nin observing\\n\\ni think you are very likely to suffer the most of the two\\nyour feelings are less reconciled to the change than mine\\nby remaining in the neighbourhood i am become inured to it\\n\\nshe could have said more on the subject for she had in fact\\nso high an opinion of the crofts and considered her father\\nso very fortunate in his tenants felt the parish to be so sure\\nof a good example and the poor of the best attention and relief\\nthat however sorry and ashamed for the necessity of the removal\\nshe could not but in conscience feel that they were gone\\nwho deserved not to stay and that kellynch hall had passed\\ninto better hands than its owners  these convictions must unquestionably\\nhave their own pain and severe was its kind but they precluded\\nthat pain which lady russell would suffer in entering the house again\\nand returning through the wellknown apartments\\n\\nin such moments anne had no power of saying to herself\\nthese rooms ought to belong only to us  oh how fallen\\nin their destination  how unworthily occupied  an ancient family\\nto be so driven away  strangers filling their place\\nno except when she thought of her mother and remembered where\\nshe had been used to sit and preside she had no sigh of that description\\nto heave\\n\\nmrs croft always met her with a kindness which gave her the pleasure\\nof fancying herself a favourite and on the present occasion\\nreceiving her in that house there was particular attention\\n\\nthe sad accident at lyme was soon the prevailing topic\\nand on comparing their latest accounts of the invalid it appeared\\nthat each lady dated her intelligence from the same hour of yestermorn\\nthat captain wentworth had been in kellynch yesterday the first time\\nsince the accident had brought anne the last note which she had\\nnot been able to trace the exact steps of had staid a few hours\\nand then returned again to lyme and without any present intention\\nof quitting it any more  he had enquired after her she found\\nparticularly had expressed his hope of miss elliots not being\\nthe worse for her exertions and had spoken of those exertions as great\\nthis was handsome and gave her more pleasure than almost anything else\\ncould have done\\n\\nas to the sad catastrophe itself it could be canvassed only in one style\\nby a couple of steady sensible women whose judgements had to work\\non ascertained events and it was perfectly decided that it had been\\nthe consequence of much thoughtlessness and much imprudence\\nthat its effects were most alarming and that it was frightful to think\\nhow long miss musgroves recovery might yet be doubtful and how liable\\nshe would still remain to suffer from the concussion hereafter\\nthe admiral wound it up summarily by exclaiming\\n\\nay a very bad business indeed  a new sort of way this\\nfor a young fellow to be making love by breaking his mistresss head\\nis not it miss elliot  this is breaking a head and giving a plaster\\ntruly\\n\\nadmiral crofts manners were not quite of the tone to suit lady russell\\nbut they delighted anne  his goodness of heart and simplicity\\nof character were irresistible\\n\\nnow this must be very bad for you said he suddenly rousing from\\na little reverie to be coming and finding us here  i had not\\nrecollected it before i declare but it must be very bad\\nbut now do not stand upon ceremony  get up and go over all the rooms\\nin the house if you like it\\n\\nanother time sir i thank you not now\\n\\nwell whenever it suits you  you can slip in from the shrubbery\\nat any time and there you will find we keep our umbrellas hanging up\\nby that door  a good place is not it  but checking himself\\nyou will not think it a good place for yours were always kept\\nin the butlers room  ay so it always is i believe\\none mans ways may be as good as anothers but we all like our own best\\nand so you must judge for yourself whether it would be better for you\\nto go about the house or not\\n\\nanne finding she might decline it did so very gratefully\\n\\nwe have made very few changes either continued the admiral\\nafter thinking a moment  very few  we told you about the laundrydoor\\nat uppercross  that has been a very great improvement\\nthe wonder was how any family upon earth could bear with the inconvenience\\nof its opening as it did so long  you will tell sir walter\\nwhat we have done and that mr shepherd thinks it the greatest improvement\\nthe house ever had  indeed i must do ourselves the justice to say\\nthat the few alterations we have made have been all very much\\nfor the better  my wife should have the credit of them however\\ni have done very little besides sending away some of the large\\nlookingglasses from my dressingroom which was your fathers\\na very good man and very much the gentleman i am sure\\nbut i should think miss elliot looking with serious reflection\\ni should think he must be rather a dressy man for his time of life\\nsuch a number of lookingglasses oh lord there was no getting away\\nfrom ones self  so i got sophy to lend me a hand and we soon\\nshifted their quarters and now i am quite snug with my\\nlittle shaving glass in one corner and another great thing\\nthat i never go near\\n\\nanne amused in spite of herself was rather distressed for an answer\\nand the admiral fearing he might not have been civil enough\\ntook up the subject again to say\\n\\nthe next time you write to your good father miss elliot\\npray give him my compliments and mrs crofts and say that we are\\nsettled here quite to our liking and have no fault at all to find\\nwith the place  the breakfastroom chimney smokes a little\\ni grant you but it is only when the wind is due north and blows hard\\nwhich may not happen three times a winter  and take it altogether\\nnow that we have been into most of the houses hereabouts and can judge\\nthere is not one that we like better than this  pray say so\\nwith my compliments  he will be glad to hear it\\n\\nlady russell and mrs croft were very well pleased with each other\\nbut the acquaintance which this visit began was fated not to proceed\\nfar at present for when it was returned the crofts announced\\nthemselves to be going away for a few weeks to visit their connexions\\nin the north of the county and probably might not be at home again\\nbefore lady russell would be removing to bath\\n\\nso ended all danger to anne of meeting captain wentworth at kellynch hall\\nor of seeing him in company with her friend  everything was safe enough\\nand she smiled over the many anxious feelings she had wasted\\non the subject\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 14\\n\\n\\nthough charles and mary had remained at lyme much longer after\\nmr and mrs musgroves going than anne conceived they could have been\\nat all wanted they were yet the first of the family to be at home again\\nand as soon as possible after their return to uppercross\\nthey drove over to the lodge  they had left louisa beginning to sit up\\nbut her head though clear was exceedingly weak and her nerves\\nsusceptible to the highest extreme of tenderness and though\\nshe might be pronounced to be altogether doing very well\\nit was still impossible to say when she might be able to bear\\nthe removal home and her father and mother who must return\\nin time to receive their younger children for the christmas holidays\\nhad hardly a hope of being allowed to bring her with them\\n\\nthey had been all in lodgings together  mrs musgrove had\\ngot mrs harvilles children away as much as she could every possible\\nsupply from uppercross had been furnished to lighten the inconvenience\\nto the harvilles while the harvilles had been wanting them\\nto come to dinner every day and in short it seemed to have been\\nonly a struggle on each side as to which should be most disinterested\\nand hospitable\\n\\nmary had had her evils but upon the whole as was evident\\nby her staying so long she had found more to enjoy than to suffer\\ncharles hayter had been at lyme oftener than suited her and when\\nthey dined with the harvilles there had been only a maidservant to wait\\nand at first mrs harville had always given mrs musgrove precedence\\nbut then she had received so very handsome an apology from her\\non finding out whose daughter she was and there had been so much\\ngoing on every day there had been so many walks between their lodgings\\nand the harvilles and she had got books from the library\\nand changed them so often that the balance had certainly been\\nmuch in favour of lyme  she had been taken to charmouth too\\nand she had bathed and she had gone to church and there were a great many\\nmore people to look at in the church at lyme than at uppercross\\nand all this joined to the sense of being so very useful\\nhad made really an agreeable fortnight\\n\\nanne enquired after captain benwick marys face was clouded directly\\ncharles laughed\\n\\noh captain benwick is very well i believe but he is\\na very odd young man  i do not know what he would be at\\nwe asked him to come home with us for a day or two  charles undertook\\nto give him some shooting and he seemed quite delighted and for my part\\ni thought it was all settled when behold on tuesday night\\nhe made a very awkward sort of excuse he never shot and he had\\nbeen quite misunderstood and he had promised this and he had\\npromised that and the end of it was i found that he did not mean to come\\ni suppose he was afraid of finding it dull but upon my word\\ni should have thought we were lively enough at the cottage\\nfor such a heartbroken man as captain benwick\\n\\ncharles laughed again and said now mary you know very well\\nhow it really was  it was all your doing turning to anne\\nhe fancied that if he went with us he should find you close by\\nhe fancied everybody to be living in uppercross and when he discovered\\nthat lady russell lived three miles off his heart failed him\\nand he had not courage to come  that is the fact upon my honour\\nmary knows it is\\n\\nbut mary did not give into it very graciously whether from\\nnot considering captain benwick entitled by birth and situation\\nto be in love with an elliot or from not wanting to believe\\nanne a greater attraction to uppercross than herself must be\\nleft to be guessed  annes goodwill however was not to be lessened\\nby what she heard  she boldly acknowledged herself flattered\\nand continued her enquiries\\n\\noh he talks of you cried charles in such terms\\nmary interrupted him i declare charles i never heard him\\nmention anne twice all the time i was there  i declare anne\\nhe never talks of you at all\\n\\nno admitted charles i do not know that he ever does in a general\\nway but however it is a very clear thing that he admires you exceedingly\\nhis head is full of some books that he is reading upon your recommendation\\nand he wants to talk to you about them he has found out something or other\\nin one of them which he thinksoh i cannot pretend to remember it\\nbut it was something very finei overheard him telling henrietta\\nall about it and then miss elliot was spoken of in the highest terms\\nnow mary i declare it was so i heard it myself and you were\\nin the other room  elegance sweetness beauty oh there was no end\\nof miss elliots charms\\n\\nand i am sure cried mary warmly it was a very little to his credit\\nif he did  miss harville only died last june  such a heart\\nis very little worth having is it lady russell  i am sure\\nyou will agree with me\\n\\ni must see captain benwick before i decide said lady russell smiling\\n\\nand that you are very likely to do very soon i can tell you maam\\nsaid charles  though he had not nerves for coming away with us\\nand setting off again afterwards to pay a formal visit here\\nhe will make his way over to kellynch one day by himself\\nyou may depend on it  i told him the distance and the road\\nand i told him of the churchs being so very well worth seeing\\nfor as he has a taste for those sort of things i thought that would\\nbe a good excuse and he listened with all his understanding and soul\\nand i am sure from his manner that you will have him calling here soon\\nso i give you notice lady russell\\n\\nany acquaintance of annes will always be welcome to me\\nwas lady russells kind answer\\n\\noh as to being annes acquaintance said mary i think he is rather\\nmy acquaintance for i have been seeing him every day this last fortnight\\n\\nwell as your joint acquaintance then i shall be very happy\\nto see captain benwick\\n\\nyou will not find anything very agreeable in him i assure you maam\\nhe is one of the dullest young men that ever lived  he has walked with me\\nsometimes from one end of the sands to the other without saying a word\\nhe is not at all a wellbred young man  i am sure you will not like him\\n\\nthere we differ mary said anne  i think lady russell would like him\\ni think she would be so much pleased with his mind that she would\\nvery soon see no deficiency in his manner\\n\\nso do i anne said charles  i am sure lady russell would like him\\nhe is just lady russells sort  give him a book and he will\\nread all day long\\n\\nyes that he will exclaimed mary tauntingly  he will sit poring\\nover his book and not know when a person speaks to him or when one\\ndrops ones scissors or anything that happens  do you think\\nlady russell would like that\\n\\nlady russell could not help laughing  upon my word said she\\ni should not have supposed that my opinion of any one could have\\nadmitted of such difference of conjecture steady and matter of fact\\nas i may call myself  i have really a curiosity to see the person\\nwho can give occasion to such directly opposite notions\\ni wish he may be induced to call here  and when he does mary\\nyou may depend upon hearing my opinion but i am determined\\nnot to judge him beforehand\\n\\nyou will not like him i will answer for it\\n\\nlady russell began talking of something else  mary spoke with animation\\nof their meeting with or rather missing mr elliot so extraordinarily\\n\\nhe is a man said lady russell whom i have no wish to see\\nhis declining to be on cordial terms with the head of his family\\nhas left a very strong impression in his disfavour with me\\n\\nthis decision checked marys eagerness and stopped her short\\nin the midst of the elliot countenance\\n\\nwith regard to captain wentworth though anne hazarded no enquiries\\nthere was voluntary communication sufficient  his spirits had been\\ngreatly recovering lately as might be expected  as louisa improved\\nhe had improved and he was now quite a different creature\\nfrom what he had been the first week  he had not seen louisa\\nand was so extremely fearful of any ill consequence to her\\nfrom an interview that he did not press for it at all and\\non the contrary seemed to have a plan of going away for a week\\nor ten days till her head was stronger  he had talked of going\\ndown to plymouth for a week and wanted to persuade captain benwick\\nto go with him but as charles maintained to the last captain benwick\\nseemed much more disposed to ride over to kellynch\\n\\nthere can be no doubt that lady russell and anne were both\\noccasionally thinking of captain benwick from this time\\nlady russell could not hear the doorbell without feeling that it might\\nbe his herald nor could anne return from any stroll of solitary indulgence\\nin her fathers grounds or any visit of charity in the village\\nwithout wondering whether she might see him or hear of him\\ncaptain benwick came not however  he was either less disposed for it\\nthan charles had imagined or he was too shy and after giving him\\na weeks indulgence lady russell determined him to be unworthy\\nof the interest which he had been beginning to excite\\n\\nthe musgroves came back to receive their happy boys and girls from school\\nbringing with them mrs harvilles little children to improve the noise\\nof uppercross and lessen that of lyme  henrietta remained with louisa\\nbut all the rest of the family were again in their usual quarters\\n\\nlady russell and anne paid their compliments to them once\\nwhen anne could not but feel that uppercross was already quite alive again\\nthough neither henrietta nor louisa nor charles hayter\\nnor captain wentworth were there the room presented as strong a contrast\\nas could be wished to the last state she had seen it in\\n\\nimmediately surrounding mrs musgrove were the little harvilles\\nwhom she was sedulously guarding from the tyranny of the two children\\nfrom the cottage expressly arrived to amuse them  on one side\\nwas a table occupied by some chattering girls cutting up silk\\nand gold paper and on the other were tressels and trays\\nbending under the weight of brawn and cold pies where riotous boys\\nwere holding high revel the whole completed by a roaring christmas fire\\nwhich seemed determined to be heard in spite of all the noise\\nof the others  charles and mary also came in of course\\nduring their visit and mr musgrove made a point of paying his respects\\nto lady russell and sat down close to her for ten minutes\\ntalking with a very raised voice but from the clamour of the children\\non his knees generally in vain  it was a fine familypiece\\n\\nanne judging from her own temperament would have deemed\\nsuch a domestic hurricane a bad restorative of the nerves\\nwhich louisas illness must have so greatly shaken  but mrs musgrove\\nwho got anne near her on purpose to thank her most cordially\\nagain and again for all her attentions to them concluded\\na short recapitulation of what she had suffered herself by observing\\nwith a happy glance round the room that after all she had gone through\\nnothing was so likely to do her good as a little quiet cheerfulness\\nat home\\n\\nlouisa was now recovering apace  her mother could even think of her\\nbeing able to join their party at home before her brothers and sisters\\nwent to school again  the harvilles had promised to come with her\\nand stay at uppercross whenever she returned  captain wentworth was gone\\nfor the present to see his brother in shropshire\\n\\ni hope i shall remember in future said lady russell as soon as\\nthey were reseated in the carriage not to call at uppercross\\nin the christmas holidays\\n\\neverybody has their taste in noises as well as in other matters\\nand sounds are quite innoxious or most distressing by their sort\\nrather than their quantity  when lady russell not long afterwards\\nwas entering bath on a wet afternoon and driving through\\nthe long course of streets from the old bridge to camden place\\namidst the dash of other carriages the heavy rumble of carts and drays\\nthe bawling of newspapermen muffinmen and milkmen and the ceaseless\\nclink of pattens she made no complaint  no these were noises\\nwhich belonged to the winter pleasures her spirits rose\\nunder their influence and like mrs musgrove she was feeling\\nthough not saying that after being long in the country nothing could be\\nso good for her as a little quiet cheerfulness\\n\\nanne did not share these feelings  she persisted in a very determined\\nthough very silent disinclination for bath caught the first dim view\\nof the extensive buildings smoking in rain without any wish\\nof seeing them better felt their progress through the streets to be\\nhowever disagreeable yet too rapid for who would be glad to see her\\nwhen she arrived  and looked back with fond regret to the bustles\\nof uppercross and the seclusion of kellynch\\n\\nelizabeths last letter had communicated a piece of news of some interest\\nmr elliot was in bath  he had called in camden place had called\\na second time a third had been pointedly attentive  if elizabeth\\nand her father did not deceive themselves had been taking much pains\\nto seek the acquaintance and proclaim the value of the connection\\nas he had formerly taken pains to shew neglect  this was very wonderful\\nif it were true and lady russell was in a state of very agreeable\\ncuriosity and perplexity about mr elliot already recanting the sentiment\\nshe had so lately expressed to mary of his being a man whom she had\\nno wish to see  she had a great wish to see him  if he really sought\\nto reconcile himself like a dutiful branch he must be forgiven\\nfor having dismembered himself from the paternal tree\\n\\nanne was not animated to an equal pitch by the circumstance\\nbut she felt that she would rather see mr elliot again than not\\nwhich was more than she could say for many other persons in bath\\n\\nshe was put down in camden place and lady russell then drove\\nto her own lodgings in rivers street\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 15\\n\\n\\nsir walter had taken a very good house in camden place\\na lofty dignified situation such as becomes a man of consequence\\nand both he and elizabeth were settled there much to their satisfaction\\n\\nanne entered it with a sinking heart anticipating an imprisonment\\nof many months and anxiously saying to herself oh when shall i\\nleave you again  a degree of unexpected cordiality however\\nin the welcome she received did her good  her father and sister\\nwere glad to see her for the sake of shewing her the house and furniture\\nand met her with kindness  her making a fourth when they\\nsat down to dinner was noticed as an advantage\\n\\nmrs clay was very pleasant and very smiling but her courtesies and smiles\\nwere more a matter of course  anne had always felt that she would\\npretend what was proper on her arrival but the complaisance of the others\\nwas unlooked for  they were evidently in excellent spirits\\nand she was soon to listen to the causes  they had no inclination\\nto listen to her  after laying out for some compliments of being\\ndeeply regretted in their old neighbourhood which anne could not pay\\nthey had only a few faint enquiries to make before the talk must be\\nall their own  uppercross excited no interest kellynch very little\\nit was all bath\\n\\nthey had the pleasure of assuring her that bath more than answered\\ntheir expectations in every respect  their house was undoubtedly\\nthe best in camden place their drawingrooms had many decided advantages\\nover all the others which they had either seen or heard of\\nand the superiority was not less in the style of the fittingup\\nor the taste of the furniture  their acquaintance was\\nexceedingly sought after  everybody was wanting to visit them\\nthey had drawn back from many introductions and still were\\nperpetually having cards left by people of whom they knew nothing\\n\\nhere were funds of enjoyment  could anne wonder that her father\\nand sister were happy  she might not wonder but she must sigh\\nthat her father should feel no degradation in his change should see\\nnothing to regret in the duties and dignity of the resident landholder\\nshould find so much to be vain of in the littlenesses of a town\\nand she must sigh and smile and wonder too as elizabeth threw open\\nthe foldingdoors and walked with exultation from one drawingroom\\nto the other boasting of their space at the possibility of that woman\\nwho had been mistress of kellynch hall finding extent to be proud of\\nbetween two walls perhaps thirty feet asunder\\n\\nbut this was not all which they had to make them happy\\nthey had mr elliot too  anne had a great deal to hear of mr elliot\\nhe was not only pardoned they were delighted with him\\nhe had been in bath about a fortnight he had passed through bath\\nin november in his way to london when the intelligence of\\nsir walters being settled there had of course reached him\\nthough only twentyfour hours in the place but he had not been able\\nto avail himself of it but he had now been a fortnight in bath\\nand his first object on arriving had been to leave his card\\nin camden place following it up by such assiduous endeavours to meet\\nand when they did meet by such great openness of conduct\\nsuch readiness to apologize for the past such solicitude to be received\\nas a relation again that their former good understanding\\nwas completely reestablished\\n\\nthey had not a fault to find in him  he had explained away\\nall the appearance of neglect on his own side  it had originated\\nin misapprehension entirely  he had never had an idea of\\nthrowing himself off he had feared that he was thrown off\\nbut knew not why and delicacy had kept him silent  upon the hint\\nof having spoken disrespectfully or carelessly of the family\\nand the family honours he was quite indignant  he who had ever boasted\\nof being an elliot and whose feelings as to connection\\nwere only too strict to suit the unfeudal tone of the present day\\nhe was astonished indeed but his character and general conduct\\nmust refute it  he could refer sir walter to all who knew him\\nand certainly the pains he had been taking on this the first opportunity\\nof reconciliation to be restored to the footing of a relation\\nand heirpresumptive was a strong proof of his opinions on the subject\\n\\nthe circumstances of his marriage too were found to admit of\\nmuch extenuation  this was an article not to be entered on by himself\\nbut a very intimate friend of his a colonel wallis a highly\\nrespectable man perfectly the gentleman and not an illlooking man\\nsir walter added who was living in very good style in marlborough\\nbuildings and had at his own particular request been admitted\\nto their acquaintance through mr elliot had mentioned one or two things\\nrelative to the marriage which made a material difference\\nin the discredit of it\\n\\ncolonel wallis had known mr elliot long had been well acquainted\\nalso with his wife had perfectly understood the whole story\\nshe was certainly not a woman of family but well educated\\naccomplished rich and excessively in love with his friend\\nthere had been the charm  she had sought him  without that attraction\\nnot all her money would have tempted elliot and sir walter was\\nmoreover assured of her having been a very fine woman\\nhere was a great deal to soften the business  a very fine woman\\nwith a large fortune in love with him  sir walter seemed to admit it\\nas complete apology and though elizabeth could not see the circumstance\\nin quite so favourable a light she allowed it be a great extenuation\\n\\nmr elliot had called repeatedly had dined with them once\\nevidently delighted by the distinction of being asked for they\\ngave no dinners in general delighted in short by every proof\\nof cousinly notice and placing his whole happiness in being\\non intimate terms in camden place\\n\\nanne listened but without quite understanding it  allowances\\nlarge allowances she knew must be made for the ideas of those who spoke\\nshe heard it all under embellishment  all that sounded extravagant\\nor irrational in the progress of the reconciliation might have no origin\\nbut in the language of the relators  still however she had\\nthe sensation of there being something more than immediately appeared\\nin mr elliots wishing after an interval of so many years\\nto be well received by them  in a worldly view he had nothing to gain\\nby being on terms with sir walter nothing to risk by a state of variance\\nin all probability he was already the richer of the two\\nand the kellynch estate would as surely be his hereafter as the title\\na sensible man and he had looked like a very sensible man\\nwhy should it be an object to him  she could only offer one solution\\nit was perhaps for elizabeths sake  there might really have been\\na liking formerly though convenience and accident had drawn him\\na different way and now that he could afford to please himself\\nhe might mean to pay his addresses to her  elizabeth was certainly\\nvery handsome with wellbred elegant manners and her character\\nmight never have been penetrated by mr elliot knowing her but in public\\nand when very young himself  how her temper and understanding\\nmight bear the investigation of his present keener time of life\\nwas another concern and rather a fearful one  most earnestly did she wish\\nthat he might not be too nice or too observant if elizabeth\\nwere his object and that elizabeth was disposed to believe herself so\\nand that her friend mrs clay was encouraging the idea seemed apparent\\nby a glance or two between them while mr elliots frequent visits\\nwere talked of\\n\\nanne mentioned the glimpses she had had of him at lyme but without\\nbeing much attended to  oh yes perhaps it had been mr elliot\\nthey did not know  it might be him perhaps  they could not listen\\nto her description of him  they were describing him themselves\\nsir walter especially  he did justice to his very gentlemanlike\\nappearance his air of elegance and fashion his good shaped face\\nhis sensible eye but at the same time must lament his being\\nvery much underhung a defect which time seemed to have increased\\nnor could he pretend to say that ten years had not altered\\nalmost every feature for the worse  mr elliot appeared to think\\nthat he sir walter was looking exactly as he had done when\\nthey last parted but sir walter had not been able to return\\nthe compliment entirely which had embarrassed him  he did not mean\\nto complain however  mr elliot was better to look at than most men\\nand he had no objection to being seen with him anywhere\\n\\nmr elliot and his friends in marlborough buildings were talked of\\nthe whole evening  colonel wallis had been so impatient to be\\nintroduced to them and mr elliot so anxious that he should\\nand there was a mrs wallis at present known only to them by description\\nas she was in daily expectation of her confinement but mr elliot\\nspoke of her as a most charming woman quite worthy of being known\\nin camden place and as soon as she recovered they were to be acquainted\\nsir walter thought much of mrs wallis she was said to be\\nan excessively pretty woman beautiful  he longed to see her\\nhe hoped she might make some amends for the many very plain faces\\nhe was continually passing in the streets  the worst of bath was\\nthe number of its plain women  he did not mean to say that there were\\nno pretty women but the number of the plain was out of all proportion\\nhe had frequently observed as he walked that one handsome face\\nwould be followed by thirty or fiveandthirty frights and once\\nas he had stood in a shop on bond street he had counted\\neightyseven women go by one after another without there being\\na tolerable face among them  it had been a frosty morning\\nto be sure a sharp frost which hardly one woman in a thousand\\ncould stand the test of  but still there certainly were\\na dreadful multitude of ugly women in bath and as for the men\\nthey were infinitely worse  such scarecrows as the streets were full of\\nit was evident how little the women were used to the sight of anything\\ntolerable by the effect which a man of decent appearance produced\\nhe had never walked anywhere arminarm with colonel wallis\\nwho was a fine military figure though sandyhaired without observing\\nthat every womans eye was upon him every womans eye was sure to be\\nupon colonel wallis  modest sir walter  he was not allowed\\nto escape however  his daughter and mrs clay united in hinting\\nthat colonel walliss companion might have as good a figure\\nas colonel wallis and certainly was not sandyhaired\\n\\nhow is mary looking said sir walter in the height of his good humour\\nthe last time i saw her she had a red nose but i hope that may not\\nhappen every day\\n\\noh no that must have

everything  a knock at the door and so late\\nit was ten oclock  could it be mr elliot  they knew he was to dine\\nin lansdown crescent  it was possible that he might stop in his way home\\nto ask them how they did  they could think of no one else\\nmrs clay decidedly thought it mr elliots knock  mrs clay was right\\nwith all the state which a butler and footboy could give\\nmr elliot was ushered into the room\\n\\nit was the same the very same man with no difference but of dress\\nanne drew a little back while the others received his compliments\\nand her sister his apologies for calling at so unusual an hour\\nbut he could not be so near without wishing to know that neither she\\nnor her friend had taken cold the day before c c which was\\nall as politely done and as politely taken as possible but her part\\nmust follow then  sir walter talked of his youngest daughter\\nmr elliot must give him leave to present him to his youngest daughter\\nthere was no occasion for remembering mary and anne smiling and\\nblushing very becomingly shewed to mr elliot the pretty features\\nwhich he had by no means forgotten and instantly saw with amusement\\nat his little start of surprise that he had not been at all aware\\nof who she was  he looked completely astonished but not more astonished\\nthan pleased his eyes brightened and with the most perfect alacrity\\nhe welcomed the relationship alluded to the past and entreated\\nto be received as an acquaintance already  he was quite as goodlooking\\nas he had appeared at lyme his countenance improved by speaking\\nand his manners were so exactly what they ought to be so polished\\nso easy so particularly agreeable that she could compare them\\nin excellence to only one persons manners  they were not the same\\nbut they were perhaps equally good\\n\\nhe sat down with them and improved their conversation very much\\nthere could be no doubt of his being a sensible man  ten minutes\\nwere enough to certify that  his tone his expressions\\nhis choice of subject his knowing where to stop it was all\\nthe operation of a sensible discerning mind  as soon as he could\\nhe began to talk to her of lyme wanting to compare opinions\\nrespecting the place but especially wanting to speak of the circumstance\\nof their happening to be guests in the same inn at the same time\\nto give his own route understand something of hers and regret that\\nhe should have lost such an opportunity of paying his respects to her\\nshe gave him a short account of her party and business at lyme\\nhis regret increased as he listened  he had spent his whole\\nsolitary evening in the room adjoining theirs had heard voices\\nmirth continually thought they must be a most delightful set of people\\nlonged to be with them but certainly without the smallest suspicion\\nof his possessing the shadow of a right to introduce himself\\nif he had but asked who the party were  the name of musgrove would\\nhave told him enough  well it would serve to cure him of\\nan absurd practice of never asking a question at an inn\\nwhich he had adopted when quite a young man on the principal\\nof its being very ungenteel to be curious\\n\\nthe notions of a young man of one or two and twenty said he\\nas to what is necessary in manners to make him quite the thing\\nare more absurd i believe than those of any other set of beings\\nin the world  the folly of the means they often employ\\nis only to be equalled by the folly of what they have in view\\n\\nbut he must not be addressing his reflections to anne alone\\nhe knew it he was soon diffused again among the others\\nand it was only at intervals that he could return to lyme\\n\\nhis enquiries however produced at length an account of the scene\\nshe had been engaged in there soon after his leaving the place\\nhaving alluded to an accident  he must hear the whole\\nwhen he questioned sir walter and elizabeth began to question also\\nbut the difference in their manner of doing it could not be unfelt\\nshe could only compare mr elliot to lady russell in the wish\\nof really comprehending what had passed and in the degree of concern\\nfor what she must have suffered in witnessing it\\n\\nhe staid an hour with them  the elegant little clock on the mantel\\npiece had struck eleven with its silver sounds and the watchman\\nwas beginning to be heard at a distance telling the same tale\\nbefore mr elliot or any of them seemed to feel that he had been there long\\n\\nanne could not have supposed it possible that her first evening in\\ncamden place could have passed so well\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 16\\n\\n\\nthere was one point which anne on returning to her family\\nwould have been more thankful to ascertain even than mr elliots\\nbeing in love with elizabeth which was her fathers not being\\nin love with mrs clay and she was very far from easy about it\\nwhen she had been at home a few hours  on going down to breakfast\\nthe next morning she found there had just been a decent pretence\\non the ladys side of meaning to leave them  she could imagine mrs clay\\nto have said that now miss anne was come she could not suppose herself\\nat all wanted for elizabeth was replying in a sort of whisper\\nthat must not be any reason indeed  i assure you i feel it none\\nshe is nothing to me compared with you  and she was in full time\\nto hear her father say my dear madam this must not be  as yet\\nyou have seen nothing of bath  you have been here only to be useful\\nyou must not run away from us now  you must stay to be acquainted\\nwith mrs wallis the beautiful mrs wallis  to your fine mind\\ni well know the sight of beauty is a real gratification\\n\\nhe spoke and looked so much in earnest that anne was not surprised\\nto see mrs clay stealing a glance at elizabeth and herself\\nher countenance perhaps might express some watchfulness\\nbut the praise of the fine mind did not appear to excite a thought\\nin her sister  the lady could not but yield to such joint entreaties\\nand promise to stay\\n\\nin the course of the same morning anne and her father chancing to be\\nalone together he began to compliment her on her improved looks\\nhe thought her less thin in her person in her cheeks her skin\\nher complexion greatly improved clearer fresher  had she been\\nusing any thing in particular  no nothing  merely gowland\\nhe supposed  no nothing at all  ha he was surprised at that\\nand added certainly you cannot do better than to continue as you are\\nyou cannot be better than well or i should recommend gowland\\nthe constant use of gowland during the spring months  mrs clay has been\\nusing it at my recommendation and you see what it has done for her\\nyou see how it has carried away her freckles\\n\\nif elizabeth could but have heard this  such personal praise\\nmight have struck her especially as it did not appear to anne\\nthat the freckles were at all lessened  but everything must\\ntake its chance  the evil of a marriage would be much diminished\\nif elizabeth were also to marry  as for herself she might always\\ncommand a home with lady russell\\n\\nlady russells composed mind and polite manners were put to some trial\\non this point in her intercourse in camden place  the sight of mrs clay\\nin such favour and of anne so overlooked was a perpetual provocation\\nto her there and vexed her as much when she was away as a person in bath\\nwho drinks the water gets all the new publications and has\\na very large acquaintance has time to be vexed\\n\\nas mr elliot became known to her she grew more charitable\\nor more indifferent towards the others  his manners were\\nan immediate recommendation and on conversing with him she found\\nthe solid so fully supporting the superficial that she was at first\\nas she told anne almost ready to exclaim can this be mr elliot\\nand could not seriously picture to herself a more agreeable\\nor estimable man  everything united in him good understanding\\ncorrect opinions knowledge of the world and a warm heart\\nhe had strong feelings of family attachment and family honour\\nwithout pride or weakness he lived with the liberality of a man of fortune\\nwithout display he judged for himself in everything essential\\nwithout defying public opinion in any point of worldly decorum\\nhe was steady observant moderate candid never run away with by spirits\\nor by selfishness which fancied itself strong feeling and yet\\nwith a sensibility to what was amiable and lovely and a value\\nfor all the felicities of domestic life which characters of\\nfancied enthusiasm and violent agitation seldom really possess\\nshe was sure that he had not been happy in marriage  colonel wallis\\nsaid it and lady russell saw it but it had been no unhappiness\\nto sour his mind nor she began pretty soon to suspect to prevent his\\nthinking of a second choice  her satisfaction in mr elliot\\noutweighed all the plague of mrs clay\\n\\nit was now some years since anne had begun to learn that she\\nand her excellent friend could sometimes think differently\\nand it did not surprise her therefore that lady russell\\nshould see nothing suspicious or inconsistent nothing to require\\nmore motives than appeared in mr elliots great desire of a reconciliation\\nin lady russells view it was perfectly natural that mr elliot\\nat a mature time of life should feel it a most desirable object\\nand what would very generally recommend him among all sensible people\\nto be on good terms with the head of his family the simplest process\\nin the world of time upon a head naturally clear and only erring\\nin the heyday of youth  anne presumed however still to smile about it\\nand at last to mention elizabeth  lady russell listened and looked\\nand made only this cautious replyelizabeth very well\\ntime will explain\\n\\nit was a reference to the future which anne after a little observation\\nfelt she must submit to  she could determine nothing at present\\nin that house elizabeth must be first and she was in the habit\\nof such general observance as miss elliot that any particularity\\nof attention seemed almost impossible  mr elliot too\\nit must be remembered had not been a widower seven months\\na little delay on his side might be very excusable  in fact\\nanne could never see the crape round his hat without fearing that\\nshe was the inexcusable one in attributing to him such imaginations\\nfor though his marriage had not been very happy still it had existed\\nso many years that she could not comprehend a very rapid recovery\\nfrom the awful impression of its being dissolved\\n\\nhowever it might end he was without any question their\\npleasantest acquaintance in bath  she saw nobody equal to him\\nand it was a great indulgence now and then to talk to him about lyme\\nwhich he seemed to have as lively a wish to see again and to see more of\\nas herself  they went through the particulars of their first meeting\\na great many times  he gave her to understand that he had\\nlooked at her with some earnestness  she knew it well\\nand she remembered another persons look also\\n\\nthey did not always think alike  his value for rank and connexion\\nshe perceived was greater than hers  it was not merely complaisance\\nit must be a liking to the cause which made him enter warmly\\ninto her father and sisters solicitudes on a subject which\\nshe thought unworthy to excite them  the bath paper one morning\\nannounced the arrival of the dowager viscountess dalrymple\\nand her daughter the honourable miss carteret and all the comfort\\nof no camden place was swept away for many days for the dalrymples\\nin annes opinion most unfortunately were cousins of the elliots\\nand the agony was how to introduce themselves properly\\n\\nanne had never seen her father and sister before in contact with nobility\\nand she must acknowledge herself disappointed  she had hoped\\nbetter things from their high ideas of their own situation in life\\nand was reduced to form a wish which she had never foreseen\\na wish that they had more pride for our cousins lady dalrymple\\nand miss carteret our cousins the dalrymples sounded in her ears\\nall day long\\n\\nsir walter had once been in company with the late viscount\\nbut had never seen any of the rest of the family and the difficulties\\nof the case arose from there having been a suspension of all intercourse\\nby letters of ceremony ever since the death of that said late viscount\\nwhen in consequence of a dangerous illness of sir walters\\nat the same time there had been an unlucky omission at kellynch\\nno letter of condolence had been sent to ireland  the neglect\\nhad been visited on the head of the sinner for when poor lady elliot\\ndied herself no letter of condolence was received at kellynch\\nand consequently there was but too much reason to apprehend\\nthat the dalrymples considered the relationship as closed\\nhow to have this anxious business set to rights and be admitted\\nas cousins again was the question  and it was a question which\\nin a more rational manner neither lady russell nor mr elliot\\nthought unimportant  family connexions were always worth preserving\\ngood company always worth seeking lady dalrymple had taken a house\\nfor three months in laura place and would be living in style\\nshe had been at bath the year before and lady russell had heard her\\nspoken of as a charming woman  it was very desirable that\\nthe connexion should be renewed if it could be done without any\\ncompromise of propriety on the side of the elliots\\n\\nsir walter however would choose his own means and at last wrote\\na very fine letter of ample explanation regret and entreaty\\nto his right honourable cousin  neither lady russell nor mr elliot\\ncould admire the letter but it did all that was wanted\\nin bringing three lines of scrawl from the dowager viscountess\\nshe was very much honoured and should be happy in their acquaintance\\nthe toils of the business were over the sweets began  they visited\\nin laura place they had the cards of dowager viscountess dalrymple\\nand the honourable miss carteret to be arranged wherever they might\\nbe most visible  and our cousins in laura placeour cousin\\nlady dalrymple and miss carteret were talked of to everybody\\n\\nanne was ashamed  had lady dalrymple and her daughter even been\\nvery agreeable she would still have been ashamed of the agitation\\nthey created but they were nothing  there was no superiority of manner\\naccomplishment or understanding  lady dalrymple had acquired\\nthe name of a charming woman because she had a smile and a civil answer\\nfor everybody  miss carteret with still less to say was so plain\\nand so awkward that she would never have been tolerated in camden place\\nbut for her birth\\n\\nlady russell confessed she had expected something better but yet\\nit was an acquaintance worth having and when anne ventured to speak\\nher opinion of them to mr elliot he agreed to their being nothing\\nin themselves but still maintained that as a family connexion\\nas good company as those who would collect good company around them\\nthey had their value  anne smiled and said\\n\\nmy idea of good company mr elliot is the company of clever\\nwellinformed people who have a great deal of conversation\\nthat is what i call good company\\n\\nyou are mistaken said he gently that is not good company\\nthat is the best  good company requires only birth education\\nand manners and with regard to education is not very nice\\nbirth and good manners are essential but a little learning is\\nby no means a dangerous thing in good company on the contrary\\nit will do very well  my cousin anne shakes her head\\nshe is not satisfied  she is fastidious  my dear cousin\\nsitting down by her you have a better right to be fastidious\\nthan almost any other woman i know but will it answer\\nwill it make you happy  will it not be wiser to accept the society\\nof those good ladies in laura place and enjoy all the advantages\\nof the connexion as far as possible  you may depend upon it\\nthat they will move in the first set in bath this winter\\nand as rank is rank your being known to be related to them\\nwill have its use in fixing your family our family let me say\\nin that degree of consideration which we must all wish for\\n\\nyes sighed anne we shall indeed be known to be related to them\\nthen recollecting herself and not wishing to be answered she added\\ni certainly do think there has been by far too much trouble taken\\nto procure the acquaintance  i suppose smiling i have more pride\\nthan any of you but i confess it does vex me that we should be\\nso solicitous to have the relationship acknowledged which we may\\nbe very sure is a matter of perfect indifference to them\\n\\npardon me dear cousin you are unjust in your own claims\\nin london perhaps in your present quiet style of living\\nit might be as you say  but in bath sir walter elliot and his family\\nwill always be worth knowing  always acceptable as acquaintance\\n\\nwell said anne i certainly am proud too proud to enjoy a welcome\\nwhich depends so entirely upon place\\n\\ni love your indignation said he it is very natural\\nbut here you are in bath and the object is to be established here\\nwith all the credit and dignity which ought to belong to sir walter elliot\\nyou talk of being proud i am called proud i know and i shall not wish\\nto believe myself otherwise for our pride if investigated\\nwould have the same object i have no doubt though the kind may seem\\na little different  in one point i am sure my dear cousin\\nhe continued speaking lower though there was no one else in the room\\nin one point i am sure we must feel alike  we must feel that\\nevery addition to your fathers society among his equals or superiors\\nmay be of use in diverting his thoughts from those who are beneath him\\n\\nhe looked as he spoke to the seat which mrs clay had been\\nlately occupying  a sufficient explanation of what he particularly meant\\nand though anne could not believe in their having the same sort of pride\\nshe was pleased with him for not liking mrs clay and her conscience\\nadmitted that his wishing to promote her fathers getting\\ngreat acquaintance was more than excusable in the view of defeating her\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 17\\n\\n\\nwhile sir walter and elizabeth were assiduously pushing their\\ngood fortune in laura place anne was renewing an acquaintance\\nof a very different description\\n\\nshe had called on her former governess and had heard from her\\nof there being an old schoolfellow in bath who had the two strong claims\\non her attention of past kindness and present suffering  miss hamilton\\nnow mrs smith had shewn her kindness in one of those periods of her life\\nwhen it had been most valuable  anne had gone unhappy to school\\ngrieving for the loss of a mother whom she had dearly loved\\nfeeling her separation from home and suffering as a girl of fourteen\\nof strong sensibility and not high spirits must suffer at such a time\\nand miss hamilton three years older than herself but still from the want\\nof near relations and a settled home remaining another year at school\\nhad been useful and good to her in a way which had considerably lessened\\nher misery and could never be remembered with indifference\\n\\nmiss hamilton had left school had married not long afterwards\\nwas said to have married a man of fortune and this was all\\nthat anne had known of her till now that their governesss account\\nbrought her situation forward in a more decided but very different form\\n\\nshe was a widow and poor  her husband had been extravagant\\nand at his death about two years before had left his affairs\\ndreadfully involved  she had had difficulties of every sort\\nto contend with and in addition to these distresses had been afflicted\\nwith a severe rheumatic fever which finally settling in her legs\\nhad made her for the present a cripple  she had come to bath\\non that account and was now in lodgings near the hot baths\\nliving in a very humble way unable even to afford herself\\nthe comfort of a servant and of course almost excluded from society\\n\\ntheir mutual friend answered for the satisfaction which a visit\\nfrom miss elliot would give mrs smith and anne therefore\\nlost no time in going  she mentioned nothing of what she had heard\\nor what she intended at home  it would excite no proper interest there\\nshe only consulted lady russell who entered thoroughly into her sentiments\\nand was most happy to convey her as near to mrs smiths lodgings\\nin westgate buildings as anne chose to be taken\\n\\nthe visit was paid their acquaintance reestablished their interest\\nin each other more than rekindled  the first ten minutes\\nhad its awkwardness and its emotion  twelve years were gone\\nsince they had parted and each presented a somewhat different person\\nfrom what the other had imagined  twelve years had changed anne\\nfrom the blooming silent unformed girl of fifteen to the elegant\\nlittle woman of sevenandtwenty with every beauty except bloom\\nand with manners as consciously right as they were invariably gentle\\nand twelve years had transformed the finelooking wellgrown miss hamilton\\nin all the glow of health and confidence of superiority into a poor\\ninfirm helpless widow receiving the visit of her former protegee\\nas a favour but all that was uncomfortable in the meeting had soon\\npassed away and left only the interesting charm of remembering\\nformer partialities and talking over old times\\n\\nanne found in mrs smith the good sense and agreeable manners which\\nshe had almost ventured to depend on and a disposition to converse\\nand be cheerful beyond her expectation  neither the dissipations\\nof the pastand she had lived very much in the worldnor the restrictions\\nof the present neither sickness nor sorrow seemed to have\\nclosed her heart or ruined her spirits\\n\\nin the course of a second visit she talked with great openness\\nand annes astonishment increased  she could scarcely imagine\\na more cheerless situation in itself than mrs smiths  she had been\\nvery fond of her husband  she had buried him  she had been\\nused to affluence  it was gone  she had no child to connect her\\nwith life and happiness again no relations to assist in the arrangement\\nof perplexed affairs no health to make all the rest supportable\\nher accommodations were limited to a noisy parlour and a dark bedroom\\nbehind with no possibility of moving from one to the other without\\nassistance which there was only one servant in the house to afford\\nand she never quitted the house but to be conveyed into the warm bath\\nyet in spite of all this anne had reason to believe that she had\\nmoments only of languor and depression to hours of occupation\\nand enjoyment  how could it be  she watched observed reflected\\nand finally determined that this was not a case of fortitude\\nor of resignation only  a submissive spirit might be patient\\na strong understanding would supply resolution but here was something more\\nhere was that elasticity of mind that disposition to be comforted\\nthat power of turning readily from evil to good and of finding employment\\nwhich carried her out of herself which was from nature alone\\nit was the choicest gift of heaven and anne viewed her friend\\nas one of those instances in which by a merciful appointment\\nit seems designed to counterbalance almost every other want\\n\\nthere had been a time mrs smith told her when her spirits\\nhad nearly failed  she could not call herself an invalid now\\ncompared with her state on first reaching bath  then she had indeed\\nbeen a pitiable object for she had caught cold on the journey\\nand had hardly taken possession of her lodgings before she was again\\nconfined to her bed and suffering under severe and constant pain\\nand all this among strangers with the absolute necessity of having\\na regular nurse and finances at that moment particularly unfit\\nto meet any extraordinary expense  she had weathered it however\\nand could truly say that it had done her good  it had increased\\nher comforts by making her feel herself to be in good hands\\nshe had seen too much of the world to expect sudden or disinterested\\nattachment anywhere but her illness had proved to her that her landlady\\nhad a character to preserve and would not use her ill and she had been\\nparticularly fortunate in her nurse as a sister of her landlady\\na nurse by profession and who had always a home in that house\\nwhen unemployed chanced to be at liberty just in time to attend her\\nand she said mrs smith besides nursing me most admirably\\nhas really proved an invaluable acquaintance  as soon as i could\\nuse my hands she taught me to knit which has been a great amusement\\nand she put me in the way of making these little threadcases\\npincushions and cardracks which you always find me so busy about\\nand which supply me with the means of doing a little good\\nto one or two very poor families in this neighbourhood\\nshe had a large acquaintance of course professionally among those\\nwho can afford to buy and she disposes of my merchandise\\nshe always takes the right time for applying  everybodys heart is open\\nyou know when they have recently escaped from severe pain\\nor are recovering the blessing of health and nurse rooke\\nthoroughly understands when to speak  she is a shrewd intelligent\\nsensible woman  hers is a line for seeing human nature and she has\\na fund of good sense and observation which as a companion make her\\ninfinitely superior to thousands of those who having only received\\nthe best education in the world know nothing worth attending to\\ncall it gossip if you will but when nurse rooke has half an hours\\nleisure to bestow on me she is sure to have something to relate\\nthat is entertaining and profitable  something that makes one\\nknow ones species better  one likes to hear what is going on\\nto be au fait as to the newest modes of being trifling and silly\\nto me who live so much alone her conversation i assure you is a treat\\n\\nanne far from wishing to cavil at the pleasure replied\\ni can easily believe it  women of that class have great opportunities\\nand if they are intelligent may be well worth listening to\\nsuch varieties of human nature as they are in the habit of witnessing\\nand it is not merely in its follies that they are well read\\nfor they see it occasionally under every circumstance that can be\\nmost interesting or affecting  what instances must pass before them\\nof ardent disinterested selfdenying attachment of heroism fortitude\\npatience resignation  of all the conflicts and all the sacrifices\\nthat ennoble us most  a sick chamber may often furnish\\nthe worth of volumes\\n\\nyes said mrs smith more doubtingly sometimes it may\\nthough i fear its lessons are not often in the elevated style you describe\\nhere and there human nature may be great in times of trial\\nbut generally speaking it is its weakness and not its strength\\nthat appears in a sick chamber  it is selfishness and impatience\\nrather than generosity and fortitude that one hears of\\nthere is so little real friendship in the world and unfortunately\\nspeaking low and tremulously there are so many who forget\\nto think seriously till it is almost too late\\n\\nanne saw the misery of such feelings  the husband had not been\\nwhat he ought and the wife had been led among that part of mankind\\nwhich made her think worse of the world than she hoped it deserved\\nit was but a passing emotion however with mrs smith she shook it off\\nand soon added in a different tone\\n\\ni do not suppose the situation my friend mrs rooke is in at present\\nwill furnish much either to interest or edify me  she is only nursing\\nmrs wallis of marlborough buildings a mere pretty silly expensive\\nfashionable woman i believe and of course will have nothing to report\\nbut of lace and finery  i mean to make my profit of mrs wallis however\\nshe has plenty of money and i intend she shall buy all\\nthe highpriced things i have in hand now\\n\\nanne had called several times on her friend before the existence\\nof such a person was known in camden place  at last it became necessary\\nto speak of her sir walter elizabeth and mrs clay returned one morning\\nfrom laura place with a sudden invitation from lady dalrymple\\nfor the same evening and anne was already engaged to spend that evening\\nin westgate buildings  she was not sorry for the excuse\\nthey were only asked she was sure because lady dalrymple being\\nkept at home by a bad cold was glad to make use of the relationship\\nwhich had been so pressed on her and she declined on her own account\\nwith great alacrityshe was engaged to spend the evening\\nwith an old schoolfellow  they were not much interested in anything\\nrelative to anne but still there were questions enough asked\\nto make it understood what this old schoolfellow was and elizabeth\\nwas disdainful and sir walter severe\\n\\nwestgate buildings said he and who is miss anne elliot\\nto be visiting in westgate buildings  a mrs smith  a widow mrs smith\\nand who was her husband  one of five thousand mr smiths whose names\\nare to be met with everywhere  and what is her attraction\\nthat she is old and sickly  upon my word miss anne elliot\\nyou have the most extraordinary taste  everything that revolts\\nother people low company paltry rooms foul air disgusting associations\\nare inviting to you  but surely you may put off this old lady\\ntill tomorrow  she is not so near her end i presume\\nbut that she may hope to see another day  what is her age  forty\\n\\nno sir she is not oneandthirty but i do not think i can\\nput off my engagement because it is the only evening for some time\\nwhich will at once suit her and myself  she goes into the warm bath\\ntomorrow and for the rest of the week you know we are engaged\\n\\nbut what does lady russell think of this acquaintance asked elizabeth\\n\\nshe sees nothing to blame in it replied anne on the contrary\\nshe approves it and has generally taken me when i have\\ncalled on mrs smith\\n\\nwestgate buildings must have been rather surprised by the appearance\\nof a carriage drawn up near its pavement observed sir walter\\nsir henry russells widow indeed has no honours to distinguish her arms\\nbut still it is a handsome equipage and no doubt is well known\\nto convey a miss elliot  a widow mrs smith lodging in westgate buildings\\na poor widow barely able to live between thirty and forty\\na mere mrs smith an everyday mrs smith of all people and all names\\nin the world to be the chosen friend of miss anne elliot\\nand to be preferred by her to her own family connections among the nobility\\nof england and ireland  mrs smith  such a name\\n\\nmrs clay who had been present while all this passed now thought it\\nadvisable to leave the room and anne could have said much\\nand did long to say a little in defence of her friends\\nnot very dissimilar claims to theirs but her sense of personal respect\\nto her father prevented her  she made no reply  she left it\\nto himself to recollect that mrs smith was not the only widow\\nin bath between thirty and forty with little to live on\\nand no surname of dignity\\n\\nanne kept her appointment the others kept theirs and of course\\nshe heard the next morning that they had had a delightful evening\\nshe had been the only one of the set absent for sir walter\\nand elizabeth had not only been quite at her ladyships service themselves\\nbut had actually been happy to be employed by her in collecting others\\nand had been at the trouble of inviting both lady russell and mr elliot\\nand mr elliot had made a point of leaving colonel wallis early\\nand lady russell had fresh arranged all her evening engagements\\nin order to wait on her  anne had the whole history of all that\\nsuch an evening could supply from lady russell  to her\\nits greatest interest must be in having been very much talked of\\nbetween her friend and mr elliot in having been wished for regretted\\nand at the same time honoured for staying away in such a cause\\nher kind compassionate visits to this old schoolfellow\\nsick and reduced seemed to have quite delighted mr elliot\\nhe thought her a most extraordinary young woman in her temper manners\\nmind a model of female excellence  he could meet even lady russell\\nin a discussion of her merits and anne could not be given to understand\\nso much by her friend could not know herself to be so highly rated\\nby a sensible man without many of those agreeable sensations\\nwhich her friend meant to create\\n\\nlady russell was now perfectly decided in her opinion of mr elliot\\nshe was as much convinced of his meaning to gain anne in time as of\\nhis deserving her and was beginning to calculate the number of weeks\\nwhich would free him from all the remaining restraints of widowhood\\nand leave him at liberty to exert his most open powers of pleasing\\nshe would not speak to anne with half the certainty she felt on the subject\\nshe would venture on little more than hints of what might be hereafter\\nof a possible attachment on his side of the desirableness of the alliance\\nsupposing such attachment to be real and returned  anne heard her\\nand made no violent exclamations she only smiled blushed\\nand gently shook her head\\n\\ni am no matchmaker as you well know said lady russell\\nbeing much too well aware of the uncertainty of all human events\\nand calculations  i only mean that if mr elliot should some time hence\\npay his addresses to you and if you should be disposed to accept him\\ni think there would be every possibility of your being happy together\\na most suitable connection everybody must consider it but i think\\nit might be a very happy one\\n\\nmr elliot is an exceedingly agreeable man and in many respects\\ni think highly of him said anne but we should not suit\\n\\nlady russell let this pass and only said in rejoinder i own that\\nto be able to regard you as the future mistress of kellynch\\nthe future lady elliot to look forward and see you occupying\\nyour dear mothers place succeeding to all her rights\\nand all her popularity as well as to all her virtues would be\\nthe highest possible gratification to me  you are your mothers self\\nin countenance and disposition and if i might be allowed to fancy you\\nsuch as she was in situation and name and home presiding and blessing\\nin the same spot and only superior to her in being more highly valued\\nmy dearest anne it would give me more delight than is often felt\\nat my time of life\\n\\nanne was obliged to turn away to rise to walk to a distant table\\nand leaning there in pretended employment try to subdue the feelings\\nthis picture excited  for a few moments her imagination and her heart\\nwere bewitched  the idea of becoming what her mother had been\\nof having the precious name of lady elliot first revived in herself\\nof being restored to kellynch calling it her home again\\nher home for ever was a charm which she could not immediately resist\\nlady russell said not another word willing to leave the matter\\nto its own operation and believing that could mr elliot at that moment\\nwith propriety have spoken for himselfshe believed in short\\nwhat anne did not believe  the same image of mr elliot speaking\\nfor himself brought anne to composure again  the charm of kellynch\\nand of lady elliot all faded away  she never could accept him\\nand it was not only that her feelings were still adverse to any man\\nsave one her judgement on a serious consideration of the possibilities\\nof such a case was against mr elliot\\n\\nthough they had now been acquainted a month she could not be satisfied\\nthat she really knew his character  that he was a sensible man\\nan agreeable man that he talked well professed good opinions\\nseemed to judge properly and as a man of principle this was all\\nclear enough  he certainly knew what was right nor could she fix\\non any one article of moral duty evidently transgressed but yet she would\\nhave been afraid to answer for his conduct  she distrusted the past\\nif not the present  the names which occasionally dropt\\nof former associates the allusions to former practices and pursuits\\nsuggested suspicions not favourable of what he had been\\nshe saw that there had been bad habits that sunday travelling\\nhad been a common thing that there had been a period of his life\\nand probably not a short one when he had been at least\\ncareless in all serious matters and though he might now think\\nvery differently who could answer for the true sentiments of a clever\\ncautious man grown old enough to appreciate a fair character\\nhow could it ever be ascertained that his mind was truly cleansed\\n\\nmr elliot was rational discreet polished but he was not open\\nthere was never any burst of feeling any warmth of indignation or delight\\nat the evil or good of others  this to anne was a decided imperfection\\nher early impressions were incurable  she prized the frank\\nthe openhearted the eager character beyond all others\\nwarmth and enthusiasm did captivate her still  she felt that she could\\nso much more depend upon the sincerity of those who sometimes looked\\nor said a careless or a hasty thing than of those whose presence of mind\\nnever varied whose tongue never slipped\\n\\nmr elliot was too generally agreeable  various as were the tempers\\nin her fathers house he pleased them all  he endured too well\\nstood too well with every body  he had spoken to her with some\\ndegree of openness of mrs clay had appeared completely to see\\nwhat mrs clay was about and to hold her in contempt and yet\\nmrs clay found him as agreeable as any body\\n\\nlady russell saw either less or more than her young friend\\nfor she saw nothing to excite distrust  she could not imagine\\na man more exactly what he ought to be than mr elliot nor did she\\never enjoy a sweeter feeling than the hope of seeing him receive\\nthe hand of her beloved anne in kellynch church in the course of\\nthe following autumn\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 18\\n\\n\\nit was the beginning of february and anne having been a month in bath\\nwas growing very eager for news from uppercross and lyme\\nshe wanted to hear much more than mary had communicated\\nit was three weeks since she had heard at all  she only knew\\nthat henrietta was at home again and that louisa though considered to be\\nrecovering fast was still in lyme and she was thinking of them all\\nvery intently one evening when a thicker letter than usual from mary\\nwas delivered to her and to quicken the pleasure and surprise\\nwith admiral and mrs crofts compliments\\n\\nthe crofts must be in bath  a circumstance to interest her\\nthey were people whom her heart turned to very naturally\\n\\nwhat is this cried sir walter  the crofts have arrived in bath\\nthe crofts who rent kellynch  what have they brought you\\n\\na letter from uppercross cottage sir\\n\\noh those letters are convenient passports  they secure an introduction\\ni should have visited admiral croft however at any rate\\ni know what is due to my tenant\\n\\nanne could listen no longer she could not even have told how\\nthe poor admirals complexion escaped her letter engrossed her\\nit had been begun several days back\\n\\n\\n            february 1st\\n\\nmy dear annei make no apology for my silence because i know\\nhow little people think of letters in such a place as bath\\nyou must be a great deal too happy to care for uppercross which\\nas you well know affords little to write about  we have had\\na very dull christmas mr and mrs musgrove have not had one dinner party\\nall the holidays  i do not reckon the hayters as anybody\\nthe holidays however are over at last  i believe no children ever had\\nsuch long ones  i am sure i had not  the house was cleared yesterday\\nexcept of the little harvilles but you will be surprised to hear\\nthey have never gone home  mrs harville must be an odd mother\\nto part with them so long  i do not understand it  they are\\nnot at all nice children in my opinion but mrs musgrove seems to\\nlike them quite as well if not better than her grandchildren\\nwhat dreadful weather we have had  it may not be felt in bath\\nwith your nice pavements but in the country it is of some consequence\\ni have not had a creature call on me since the second week in january\\nexcept charles hayter who had been calling much oftener than was welcome\\nbetween ourselves i think it a great pity henrietta did not remain at lyme\\nas long as louisa it would have kept her a little out of his way\\nthe carriage is gone today to bring louisa and the harvilles tomorrow\\nwe are not asked to dine with them however till the day after\\nmrs musgrove is so afraid of her being fatigued by the journey\\nwhich is not very likely considering the care that will be taken of her\\nand it would be much more convenient to me to dine there tomorrow\\ni am glad you find mr elliot so agreeable and wish i could be acquainted\\nwith him too but i have my usual luck  i am always out of the way\\nwhen any thing desirable is going on always the last of my family\\nto be noticed  what an immense time mrs clay has been staying\\nwith elizabeth  does she never mean to go away  but perhaps\\nif she were to leave the room vacant we might not be invited\\nlet me know what you think of this  i do not expect my children\\nto be asked you know  i can leave them at the great house very well\\nfor a month or six weeks  i have this moment heard that the crofts\\nare going to bath almost immediately they think the admiral gouty\\ncharles heard it quite by chance they have not had the civility\\nto give me any notice or of offering to take anything\\ni do not think they improve at all as neighbours  we see nothing of them\\nand this is really an instance of gross inattention  charles joins me\\nin love and everything proper  yours affectionately\\n\\n  mary m\\n\\ni am sorry to say that i am very far from well and jemima has\\njust told me that the butcher says there is a bad sorethroat\\nvery much about  i dare say i shall catch it and my sorethroats\\nyou know are always worse than anybodys\\n\\n\\nso ended the first part which had been afterwards put into an envelope\\ncontaining nearly as much more\\n\\n\\ni kept my letter open that i might send you word how louisa\\nbore her journey and now i am extremely glad i did having a great deal\\nto add  in the first place i had a note from mrs croft yesterday\\noffering to convey anything to you a very kind friendly note indeed\\naddressed to me just as it ought i shall therefore be able to\\nmake my letter as long as i like  the admiral does not seem very ill\\nand i sincerely hope bath will do him all the good he wants\\ni shall be truly glad to have them back again  our neighbourhood\\ncannot spare such a pleasant family  but now for louisa\\ni have something to communicate that will astonish you not a little\\nshe and the harvilles came on tuesday very safely and in the evening\\nwe went to ask her how she did when we were rather surprised\\nnot to find captain benwick of the party for he had been invited\\nas well as the harvilles and what do you think was the reason\\nneither more nor less than his being in love with louisa\\nand not choosing to venture to uppercross till he had had an answer\\nfrom mr musgrove for it was all settled between him and her\\nbefore she came away and he had written to her father by captain harville\\ntrue upon my honour  are not you astonished  i shall be surprised\\nat least if you ever received a hint of it for i never did\\nmrs musgrove protests solemnly that she knew nothing of the matter\\nwe are all very well pleased however for though it is not equal to her\\nmarrying captain wentworth it is infinitely better than charles hayter\\nand mr musgrove has written his consent and captain benwick\\nis expected today  mrs harville says her husband feels a good deal\\non his poor sisters account but however louisa is a great favourite\\nwith both  indeed mrs harville and i quite agree that we love her\\nthe better for having nursed her  charles wonders what captain wentworth\\nwill say but if you remember i never thought him attached to louisa\\ni never could see anything of it  and this is the end you see\\nof captain benwicks being supposed to be an admirer of yours\\nhow charles could take such a thing into his head was always\\nincomprehensible to me  i hope he will be more agreeable now\\ncertainly not a great match for louisa musgrove but a million times better\\nthan marrying among the hayters\\n\\n\\nmary need not have feared her sisters being in any degree prepared\\nfor the news  she had never in her life been more astonished\\ncaptain benwick and louisa musgrove  it was almost too wonderful\\nfor belief and it was with the greatest effort that she could remain\\nin the room preserve an air of calmness and answer the common questions\\nof the moment  happily for her they were not many  sir walter\\nwanted to know whether the crofts travelled with four horses\\nand whether they were likely to be situated in such a part of bath\\nas it might suit miss elliot and himself to visit in but had\\nlittle curiosity beyond\\n\\nhow is mary said elizabeth and without waiting for an answer\\nand pray what brings the crofts to bath\\n\\nthey come on the admirals account  he is thought to be gouty\\n\\ngout and decrepitude said sir walter  poor old gentleman\\n\\nhave they any acquaintance here asked elizabeth\\n\\ni do not know but i can hardly suppose that at admiral crofts\\ntime of life and in his profession he should not have many acquaintance\\nin such a place as this\\n\\ni suspect said sir walter coolly that admiral croft\\nwill be best known in bath as the renter of kellynch hall\\nelizabeth may we venture to present him and his wife in laura place\\n\\noh no i think not  situated as we are with lady dalrymple cousins\\nwe ought to be very careful not to embarrass her with acquaintance\\nshe might not approve  if we were not related it would not signify\\nbut as cousins she would feel scrupulous as to any proposal of ours\\nwe had better leave the crofts to find their own level\\nthere are several oddlooking men walking about here who\\ni am told are sailors  the crofts will associate with them\\n\\nthis was sir walter and elizabeths share of interest in the letter\\nwhen mrs clay had paid her tribute of more decent attention\\nin an enquiry after mrs charles musgrove and her fine little boys\\nanne was at liberty\\n\\nin her own room she tried to comprehend it  well might charles wonder\\nhow captain wentworth would feel  perhaps he had quitted the field\\nhad given louisa up had ceased to love had found he did not love her\\nshe could not endure the idea of treachery or levity or anything\\nakin to ill usage between him and his friend  she could not endure\\nthat such a friendship as theirs should be severed unfairly\\n\\ncaptain benwick and louisa musgrove  the highspirited\\njoyoustalking louisa musgrove and the dejected thinking\\nfeeling reading captain benwick seemed each of them everything\\nthat would not suit the other  their minds most dissimilar\\nwhere could have been the attraction  the answer soon presented itself\\nit had been in situation  they had been thrown together several weeks\\nthey had been living in the same small family party  since henriettas\\ncoming away they must have been depending almost entirely on each other\\nand louisa just recovering from illness had been in an interesting state\\nand captain benwick was not inconsolable  that was a point which anne\\nhad not been able to avoid suspecting before and instead of drawing\\nthe same conclusion as mary from the present course of events\\nthey served only to confirm the idea of his having felt some\\ndawning of tenderness toward herself  she did not mean however\\nto derive much more from it to gratify her vanity than mary\\nmight have allowed  she was persuaded that any tolerably pleasing\\nyoung woman who had listened and seemed to feel for him would have\\nreceived the same compliment  he had an affectionate heart\\nhe must love somebody\\n\\nshe saw no reason against their being happy  louisa had fine\\nnaval fervour to begin with and they would soon grow more alike\\nhe would gain cheerfulness and she would learn to be an enthusiast\\nfor scott and lord byron nay that was probably learnt already\\nof course they had fallen in love over poetry  the idea of\\nlouisa musgrove turned into a person of literary taste\\nand sentimental reflection was amusing but she had no doubt\\nof its being so  the day at lyme the fall from the cobb\\nmight influence her health her nerves her courage her character to\\nthe end of her life as thoroughly as it appeared to have\\ninfluenced her fate\\n\\nthe conclusion of the whole was that if the woman who had been sensible\\nof captain wentworths merits could be allowed to prefer another man\\nthere was nothing in the engagement to excite lasting wonder\\nand if captain wentworth lost no friend by it certainly nothing\\nto be regretted  no it was not regret which made annes heart\\nbeat in spite of herself and brought the colour into her cheeks\\nwhen she thought of captain wentworth unshackled and free\\nshe had some feelings which she was ashamed to investigate\\nthey were too much like joy senseless joy\\n\\nshe longed to see the crofts but when the meeting took place\\nit was evident that no rumour of the news had yet reached them\\nthe visit of ceremony was paid and returned and louisa musgrove\\nwas mentioned and captain benwick too without even half a smile\\n\\nthe crofts had placed themselves in lodgings in gay street\\nperfectly to sir walters satisfaction  he was not at all ashamed\\nof the acquaintance and did in fact think and talk a great deal more\\nabout the admiral than the admiral ever thought or talked about him\\n\\nthe crofts knew quite as many people in bath as they wished for\\nand considered their intercourse with the elliots as a mere matter of form\\nand not in the least likely to afford them any pleasure\\nthey brought with them their country habit of being almost always together\\nhe was ordered to walk to keep off the gout and mrs croft\\nseemed to go shares with him in everything and to walk\\nfor her life to do him good  anne saw them wherever she went\\nlady russell took her out in her carriage almost every morning\\nand she never failed to think of them and never failed to see them\\nknowing their feelings as she did it was a most attractive picture\\nof happiness to her  she always watched them as long as she could\\ndelighted to fancy she understood what they might be talking of\\nas they walked along in happy independence or equally delighted\\nto see the admirals hearty shake of the hand when he encountered\\nan old friend and observe their eagerness of conversation\\nwhen occasionally forming into a little knot of the navy mrs croft\\nlooking as intelligent and keen as any of the officers around her\\n\\nanne was too much engaged with lady russell to be often walking herself\\nbut it so happened that one morning about a week or ten days\\nafter the crofts arrival it suited her best to leave her friend\\nor her friends carriage in the lower part of the town\\nand return alone to camden place and in walking up milsom street\\nshe had the good fortune to meet with the admiral  he was standing\\nby himself at a printshop window with his hands behind him\\nin earnest contemplation of some print and she not only might have\\npassed him unseen but was obliged to touch as well as address him\\nbefore she could catch his notice  when he did perceive and\\nacknowledge her however it was done with all his usual frankness\\nand good humour  ha is it you  thank you thank you\\nthis is treating me like a friend  here i am you see\\nstaring at a picture  i can never get by this shop without stopping\\nbut what a thing here is by way of a boat  do look at it\\ndid you ever see the like  what queer fellows your fine painters must be\\nto think that anybody would venture their lives in such a shapeless\\nold cockleshell as that  and yet here are two gentlemen\\nstuck up in it mightily at their ease and looking about them at the rocks\\nand mountains as if they were not to be upset the next moment\\nwhich they certainly must be  i wonder where that boat was built\\nlaughing heartily i would not venture over a horsepond in it\\nwell turning away now where are you bound  can i go anywhere\\nfor you or with you  can i be of any use\\n\\nnone i thank you unless you will give me the pleasure of your company\\nthe little way our road lies together  i am going home\\n\\n\\nthat i will with all my heart and farther too  yes yes\\nwe will have a snug walk together and i have something to tell you\\nas we go along  there take my arm thats right i do not\\nfeel comfortable if i have not a woman there  lord what a boat it is\\ntaking a last look at the picture as they began to be in motion\\n\\ndid you say that you had something to tell me sir\\n\\nyes i have presently  but here comes a friend captain brigden\\ni shall only say how dye do as we pass however  i shall not stop\\nhow dye do  brigden stares to see anybody with me but my wife\\nshe poor soul is tied by the leg  she has a blister on one of her heels\\nas large as a threeshilling piece  if you look across the street\\nyou will see admiral brand coming down and his brother  shabby fellows\\nboth of them  i am glad they are not on this side of the way\\nsophy cannot bear them  they played me a pitiful trick once\\ngot away with some of my best men  i will tell you the whole story\\nanother time  there comes old sir archibald drew and his grandson\\nlook he sees us he kisses his hand to you he takes you for my wife\\nah the peace has come too soon for that younker  poor old sir archibald\\nhow do you like bath miss elliot  it suits us very well\\nwe are always meeting with some old friend or other the streets\\nfull of them every morning sure to have plenty of chat\\nand then we get away from them all and shut ourselves in our lodgings\\nand draw in our chairs and are snug as if we were at kellynch\\nay or as we used to be even at north yarmouth and deal\\nwe do not like our lodgings here the worse i can tell you\\nfor putting us in mind of those we first had at north yarmouth\\nthe wind blows through one of the cupboards just in the same way\\n\\nwhen they were got a little farther anne ventured to press again\\nfor what he had to communicate  she hoped when clear of milsom street\\nto have her curiosity gratified but she was still obliged to wait\\nfor the admiral had made up his mind not to begin till they had\\ngained the greater space and quiet of belmont and as she was\\nnot really mrs croft she must let him have his own way\\nas soon as they were fairly ascending belmont he began\\n\\nwell now you shall hear something that will surprise you\\nbut first of all you must tell me the name of the young lady\\ni am going to talk about  that young lady you know that we have\\nall been so concerned for  the miss musgrove that all this has been\\nhappening to  her christian name  i always forget her christian name\\n\\nanne had been ashamed to appear to comprehend so soon as she really\\ndid but now she could safely suggest the name of louisa\\n\\nay ay miss louisa musgrove that is the name  i wish young ladies\\nhad not such a number of fine christian names  i should never be out\\nif they were all sophys or something of that sort  well\\nthis miss louisa we all thought you know was to marry frederick\\nhe was courting her week after week  the only wonder was\\nwhat they could be waiting for till the business at lyme came\\nthen indeed it was clear enough that they must wait till her brain\\nwas set to right  but even then there was something odd in their\\nway of going on  instead of staying at lyme he went off to plymouth\\nand then he went off to see edward  when we came back from minehead\\nhe was gone down to edwards and there he has been ever since\\nwe have seen nothing of him since november  even sophy could\\nnot understand it  but now the matter has take the strangest turn of all\\nfor this young lady the same miss musgrove instead of being\\nto marry frederick is to marry james benwick  you know james benwick\\n\\na little  i am a little acquainted with captain benwick\\n\\nwell she is to marry him  nay most likely they are married already\\nfor i do not know what they should wait for\\n\\ni thought captain benwick a very pleasing young man said anne\\nand i understand that he bears an excellent character\\n\\noh yes yes there is not a word to be said against james benwick\\nhe is only a commander it is true made last summer and these are\\nbad times for getting on but he has not another fault that i know of\\nan excellent goodhearted fellow i assure you a very active\\nzealous officer too which is more than you would think for perhaps\\nfor that soft sort of manner does not do him justice\\n\\nindeed you are mistaken there sir i should never augur want of spirit\\nfrom captain benwicks manners  i thought them particularly pleasing\\nand i will answer for it they would generally please\\n\\nwell well ladies are the best judges but james benwick is rather too\\npiano for me and though very likely it is all our partiality\\nsophy and i cannot help thinking fredericks manners better than his\\nthere is something about frederick more to our taste\\n\\nanne was caught  she had only meant to oppose the too common idea\\nof spirit and gentleness being incompatible with each other\\nnot at all to represent captain benwicks manners as the very best\\nthat could possibly be and after a little hesitation\\nshe was beginning to say i was not entering into any comparison\\nof the two friends but the admiral interrupted her with\\n\\nand the thing is certainly true  it is not a mere bit of gossip\\nwe have it from frederick himself  his sister had a letter\\nfrom him yesterday in which he tells us of it and he had just had it\\nin a letter from harville written upon the spot from uppercross\\ni fancy they are all at uppercross\\n\\nthis was an opportunity which anne could not resist she said therefore\\ni hope admiral i hope there is nothing in the style of captain\\nwentworths letter to make you and mrs croft particularly uneasy\\nit did seem last autumn as if there were an attachment between him\\nand louisa musgrove but i hope it may be understood to have worn out\\non each side equally and without violence  i hope his letter\\ndoes not breathe the spirit of an illused man\\n\\nnot at all not at all there is not an oath or a murmur\\nfrom beginning to end\\n\\nanne looked down to hide her smile\\n\\nno no frederick is not a man to whine and complain he has\\ntoo much spirit for that  if the girl likes another man better\\nit is very fit she should have him\\n\\ncertainly  but what i mean is that i hope there is nothing\\nin captain wentworths manner of writing to make you suppose\\nhe thinks himself illused by his friend which might appear\\nyou know without its being absolutely said  i should be very sorry\\nthat such a friendship as has subsisted between him and captain benwick\\nshould be destroyed or even wounded by a circumstance of this sort\\n\\nyes yes i understand you  but there is nothing at all of that nature\\nin the letter  he does not give the least fling at benwick\\ndoes not so much as say i wonder at it i have a reason of my own\\nfor wondering at it  no you would not guess from his way of writing\\nthat he had ever thought of this miss whats her name for himself\\nhe very handsomely hopes they will be happy together and there is\\nnothing very unforgiving in that i think\\n\\nanne did not receive the perfect conviction which the admiral meant\\nto convey but it would have been useless to press the enquiry farther\\nshe therefore satisfied herself with commonplace remarks or quiet\\nattention and the admiral had it all his own way\\n\\npoor frederick said he at last  now he must begin all over again\\nwith somebody else  i think we must get him to bath  sophy must write\\nand beg him to come to bath  here are pretty girls enough i am sure\\nit would be of no use to go to uppercross again for that other\\nmiss musgrove i find is bespoke by her cousin the young parson\\ndo not you think miss elliot we had better try to get him to bath\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 19\\n\\n\\nwhile admiral croft was taking this walk with anne and expressing\\nhis wish of getting captain wentworth to bath captain wentworth\\nwas already on his way thither  before mrs croft had written\\nhe was arrived and the very next time anne walked out she saw him\\n\\nmr elliot was attending his two cousins and mrs clay  they were\\nin milsom street  it began to rain not much but enough to\\nmake shelter desirable for women and quite enough to make it\\nvery desirable for miss elliot to have the advantage of being\\nconveyed home in lady dalrymples carriage which was seen waiting\\nat a little distance she anne and mrs clay therefore\\nturned into mollands while mr elliot stepped to lady dalrymple\\nto request her assistance  he soon joined them again successful\\nof course lady dalrymple would be most happy to take them home\\nand would call for them in a few minutes\\n\\nher ladyships carriage was a barouche and did not hold\\nmore than four with any comfort  miss carteret was with her mother\\nconsequently it was not reasonable to expect accommodation\\nfor all the three camden place ladies  there could be no doubt\\nas to miss elliot  whoever suffered inconvenience she must suffer none\\nbut it occupied a little time to settle the point of civility\\nbetween the other two  the rain was a mere trifle and anne was\\nmost sincere in preferring a walk with mr elliot  but the rain was also\\na mere trifle to mrs clay she would hardly allow it even to drop at all\\nand her boots were so thick much thicker than miss annes\\nand in short her civility rendered her quite as anxious to be left\\nto walk with mr elliot as anne could be and it was discussed between them\\nwith a generosity so polite and so determined that the others were\\nobliged to settle it for them miss elliot maintaining that mrs clay\\nhad a little cold already and mr elliot deciding on appeal\\nthat his cousin annes boots were rather the thickest\\n\\nit was fixed accordingly that mrs clay should be of the party\\nin the carriage and they had just reached this point when anne\\nas she sat near the window descried most decidedly and distinctly\\ncaptain wentworth walking down the street\\n\\nher start was perceptible only to herself but she instantly felt that\\nshe was the greatest simpleton in the world the most unaccountable\\nand absurd  for a few minutes she saw nothing before her\\nit was all confusion  she was lost and when she had scolded\\nback her senses she found the others still waiting for the carriage\\nand mr elliot always obliging just setting off for union street\\non a commission of mrs clays\\n\\nshe now felt a great inclination to go to the outer door\\nshe wanted to see if it rained  why was she to suspect herself\\nof another motive  captain wentworth must be out of sight\\nshe left her seat she would go one half of her should not be always\\nso much wiser than the other half or always suspecting the other\\nof being worse than it was  she would see if it rained\\nshe was sent back however in a moment by the entrance of\\ncaptain wentworth himself among a party of gentlemen and ladies\\nevidently his acquaintance and whom he must have joined\\na little below milsom street  he was more obviously struck\\nand confused by the sight of her than she had ever observed before\\nhe looked quite red  for the first time since their renewed acquaintance\\nshe felt that she was betraying the least sensibility of the two\\nshe had the advantage of him in the preparation of the last few moments\\nall the overpowering blinding bewildering first effects\\nof strong surprise were over with her  still however\\nshe had enough to feel  it was agitation pain pleasure\\na something between delight and misery\\n\\nhe spoke to her and then turned away  the character of his manner\\nwas embarrassment  she could not have called it either cold or friendly\\nor anything so certainly as embarrassed\\n\\nafter a short interval however he came towards her and spoke again\\nmutual enquiries on common subjects passed  neither of them probably\\nmuch the wiser for what they heard and anne continuing fully sensible\\nof his being less at ease than formerly  they had by dint of being\\nso very much together got to speak to each other with a considerable\\nportion of apparent indifference and calmness but he could not do it now\\ntime had changed him or louisa had changed him  there was consciousness\\nof some sort or other  he looked very well not as if he had been\\nsuffering in health or spirits and he talked of uppercross\\nof the musgroves nay even of louisa and had even a momentary look\\nof his own arch significance as he named her but yet it was\\ncaptain wentworth not comfortable not easy not able to feign that he was\\n\\nit did not surprise but it grieved anne to observe that elizabeth\\nwould not know him  she saw that he saw elizabeth that elizabeth saw him\\nthat there was complete internal recognition on each side\\nshe was convinced that he was ready to be acknowledged as an acquaintance\\nexpecting it and she had the pain of seeing her sister turn away\\nwith unalterable coldness\\n\\nlady dalrymples carriage for which miss elliot was growing\\nvery impatient now drew up the servant came in to announce it\\nit was beginning to rain again and altogether there was a delay\\nand a bustle and a talking which must make all the little crowd\\nin the shop understand that lady dalrymple was calling to convey\\nmiss elliot  at last miss elliot and her friend unattended but\\nby the servant for there was no cousin returned were walking off\\nand captain wentworth watching them turned again to anne\\nand by manner rather than words was offering his services to her\\n\\ni am much obliged to you was her answer but i am not going with them\\nthe carriage would not accommodate so many  i walk  i prefer walking\\n\\nbut it rains\\n\\noh very little  nothing that i regard\\n\\nafter a moments pause he said  though i came only yesterday\\ni have equipped myself properly for bath already you see\\npointing to a new umbrella i wish you would make use of it\\nif you are determined to walk though i think it would be more prudent\\nto let me get you a chair\\n\\nshe was very much obliged to him but declined it all repeating\\nher conviction that the rain would come to nothing at present\\nand adding i am only waiting for mr elliot  he will be here in a moment\\ni am sure\\n\\nshe had hardly spoken the words when mr elliot walked in\\ncaptain wentworth recollected him perfectly  there was no difference\\nbetween him and the man who had stood on the steps at lyme\\nadmiring anne as she passed except in the air and look and manner\\nof the privileged relation and friend  he came in with eagerness\\nappeared to see and think only of her apologised for his stay\\nwas grieved to have kept her waiting and anxious to get her away\\nwithout further loss of time and before the rain increased\\nand in another moment they walked off together her arm under his\\na gentle and embarrassed glance and a good morning to you\\nbeing all that she had time for as she passed away\\n\\nas soon as they were out of sight the ladies of captain wentworths party\\nbegan talking of them\\n\\nmr elliot does not dislike his cousin i fancy\\n\\noh no that is clear enough  one can guess what will happen there\\nhe is always with them half lives in the family i believe\\nwhat a very goodlooking man\\n\\nyes and miss atkinson who dined with him once at the wallises\\nsays he is the most agreeable man she ever was in company with\\n\\nshe is pretty i think anne elliot very pretty when one comes\\nto look at her  it is not the fashion to say so but i confess\\ni admire her more than her sister\\n\\noh so do i\\n\\nand so do i  no comparison  but the men are all wild after miss elliot\\nanne is too delicate for them\\n\\nanne would have been particularly obliged to her cousin if he would have\\nwalked by her side all the way to camden place without saying a word\\nshe had never found it so difficult to listen to him though nothing\\ncould exceed his solicitude and care and though his subjects\\nwere principally such as were wont to be always interesting\\npraise warm just and discriminating of lady russell\\nand insinuations highly rational against mrs clay  but just now\\nshe could think only of captain wentworth  she could not understand\\nhis present feelings whether he were really suffering much\\nfrom disappointment or not and till that point were settled\\nshe could not be quite herself\\n\\nshe hoped to be wise and reasonable in time but alas alas\\nshe must confess to herself that she was not wise yet\\n\\nanother circumstance very essential for her to know was how long\\nhe meant to be in bath he had not mentioned it or she could not\\nrecollect it  he might be only passing through  but it was more probable\\nthat he should be come to stay  in that case so liable as every body was\\nto meet every body in bath lady russell would in all likelihood\\nsee him somewhere  would she recollect him  how would it all be\\n\\nshe had already been obliged to tell lady russell that louisa musgrove\\nwas to marry captain benwick  it had cost her something to encounter\\nlady russells surprise and now if she were by any chance\\nto be thrown into company with captain wentworth her imperfect knowledge\\nof the matter might add another shade of prejudice against him\\n\\nthe following morning anne was out with her friend and for the first hour\\nin an incessant and fearful sort of watch for him in vain but at last\\nin returning down pulteney street she distinguished him\\non the right hand pavement at such a distance as to have him in view\\nthe greater part of the street  there were many other men about him\\nmany groups walking the same way but there was no mistaking him\\nshe looked instinctively at lady russell but not from any mad idea\\nof her recognising him so soon as she did herself  no it was\\nnot to be supposed that lady russell would perceive him till they\\nwere nearly opposite  she looked at her however from time to time\\nanxiously and when the moment approached which must point him out\\nthough not daring to look again for her own countenance she knew\\nwas unfit to be seen she was yet perfectly conscious of\\nlady russells eyes being turned exactly in the direction for him\\nof her being in short intently observing him  she could thoroughly\\ncomprehend the sort of fascination he must possess over lady russells mind\\nthe difficulty it must be for her to withdraw her eyes the astonishment\\nshe must be feeling that eight or nine years should have passed over him\\nand in foreign climes and in active service too without robbing him\\nof one personal grace\\n\\nat last lady russell drew back her head  now how would she\\nspeak of him\\n\\nyou will wonder said she what has been fixing my eye so long\\nbut i was looking after some windowcurtains which lady alicia and\\nmrs frankland were telling me of last night  they described\\nthe drawingroom windowcurtains of one of the houses on this\\nside of the way and this part of the street as being the handsomest\\nand best hung of any in bath but could not recollect the exact number\\nand i have been trying to find out which it could be but i confess\\ni can see no curtains hereabouts that answer their description\\n\\nanne sighed and blushed and smiled in pity and disdain\\neither at her friend or herself  the part which provoked her most\\nwas that in all this waste of foresight and caution she should have\\nlost the right moment for seeing whether he saw them\\n\\na day or two passed without producing anything  the theatre or the rooms\\nwhere he was most likely to be were not fashionable enough\\nfor the elliots whose evening amusements were solely in the\\nelegant stupidity of private parties in which they were getting\\nmore and more engaged and anne wearied of such a state of stagnation\\nsick of knowing nothing and fancying herself stronger because\\nher strength was not tried was quite impatient for the concert evening\\nit was a concert for the benefit of a person patronised by lady dalrymple\\nof course they must attend  it was really expected to be a good one\\nand captain wentworth was very fond of music  if she could only have\\na few minutes conversation with him again she fancied she should\\nbe satisfied and as to the power of addressing him she felt all over\\ncourage if the opportunity occurred  elizabeth had turned from him\\nlady russell overlooked him her nerves were strengthened\\nby these circumstances she felt that she owed him attention\\n\\nshe had once partly promised mrs smith to spend the evening with her\\nbut in a short hurried call she excused herself and put it off\\nwith the more decided promise of a longer visit on the morrow\\nmrs smith gave a most goodhumoured acquiescence\\n\\nby all means said she only tell me all about it when you do come\\nwho is your party\\n\\nanne named them all  mrs smith made no reply but when she was\\nleaving her said and with an expression half serious half arch\\nwell i heartily wish your concert may answer and do not fail me\\ntomorrow if you can come for i begin to have a foreboding\\nthat i may not have many more visits from you\\n\\nanne was startled and confused but after standing in a moments suspense\\nwas obliged and not sorry to be obliged to hurry away\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 20\\n\\n\\nsir walter his two daughters and mrs clay were the earliest\\nof all their party at the rooms in the evening and as lady dalrymple\\nmust be waited for they took their station by one of the fires\\nin the octagon room  but hardly were they so settled when the door\\nopened again and captain wentworth walked in alone  anne was\\nthe nearest to him and making yet a little advance she instantly spoke\\nhe was preparing only to bow and pass on but her gentle how do you do\\nbrought him out of the straight line to stand near her and make enquiries\\nin return in spite of the formidable father and sister in the back ground\\ntheir being in the back ground was a support to anne she knew nothing\\nof their looks and felt equal to everything which she believed\\nright to be done\\n\\nwhile they were speaking a whispering between her father and elizabeth\\ncaught her ear  she could not distinguish but she must guess the subject\\nand on captain wentworths making a distant bow she comprehended\\nthat her father had judged so well as to give him that\\nsimple acknowledgement of acquaintance and she was just in time\\nby a side glance to see a slight curtsey from elizabeth herself\\nthis though late and reluctant and ungracious was yet\\nbetter than nothing and her spirits improved\\n\\nafter talking however of the weather and bath and the concert\\ntheir conversation began to flag and so little was said at last\\nthat she was expecting him to go every moment but he did not\\nhe seemed in no hurry to leave her and presently with renewed spirit\\nwith a little smile a little glow he said\\n\\ni have hardly seen you since our day at lyme  i am afraid you must have\\nsuffered from the shock and the more from its not overpowering you\\nat the time\\n\\nshe assured him that she had not\\n\\nit was a frightful hour said he a frightful day and he\\npassed his hand across his eyes as if the remembrance were still\\ntoo painful but in a moment half smiling again added\\nthe day has produced some effects however has had some consequences\\nwhich must be considered as the very reverse of frightful\\nwhen you had the presence of mind to suggest that benwick would be\\nthe properest person to fetch a surgeon you could have little idea\\nof his being eventually one of those most concerned in her recovery\\n\\ncertainly i could have none  but it appearsi should hope it would be\\na very happy match  there are on both sides good principles\\nand good temper\\n\\nyes said he looking not exactly forward but there i think\\nends the resemblance  with all my soul i wish them happy and rejoice\\nover every circumstance in favour of it  they have no difficulties\\nto contend with at home no opposition no caprice no delays\\nthe musgroves are behaving like themselves most honourably and kindly\\nonly anxious with true parental hearts to promote their daughters comfort\\nall this is much very much in favour of their happiness\\nmore than perhaps\\n\\nhe stopped  a sudden recollection seemed to occur and to give him\\nsome taste of that emotion which was reddening annes cheeks\\nand fixing her eyes on the ground  after clearing his throat however\\nhe proceeded thus\\n\\ni confess that i do think there is a disparity too great a disparity\\nand in a point no less essential than mind  i regard louisa musgrove\\nas a very amiable sweettempered girl and not deficient in understanding\\nbut benwick is something more  he is a clever man a reading man\\nand i confess that i do consider his attaching himself to her\\nwith some surprise  had it been the effect of gratitude\\nhad he learnt to love her because he believed her to be preferring him\\nit would have been another thing  but i have no reason to suppose it so\\nit seems on the contrary to have been a perfectly spontaneous\\nuntaught feeling on his side and this surprises me  a man like him\\nin his situation with a heart pierced wounded almost broken\\nfanny harville was a very superior creature and his attachment to her\\nwas indeed attachment  a man does not recover from such\\na devotion of the heart to such a woman  he ought not he does not\\n\\neither from the consciousness however that his friend had recovered\\nor from other consciousness he went no farther and anne who\\nin spite of the agitated voice in which the latter part had been uttered\\nand in spite of all the various noises of the room the almost ceaseless\\nslam of the door and ceaseless buzz of persons walking through\\nhad distinguished every word was struck gratified confused\\nand beginning to breathe very quick and feel an hundred things\\nin a moment  it was impossible for her to enter on such a subject\\nand yet after a pause feeling the necessity of speaking\\nand having not the smallest wish for a total change she only deviated\\nso far as to say\\n\\nyou were a good while at lyme i think\\n\\nabout a fortnight  i could not leave it till louisas doing well\\nwas quite ascertained  i had been too deeply concerned in the mischief\\nto be soon at peace  it had been my doing solely mine\\nshe would not have been obstinate if i had not been weak\\nthe country round lyme is very fine  i walked and rode a great deal\\nand the more i saw the more i found to admire\\n\\ni should very much like to see lyme again said anne\\n\\nindeed  i should not have supposed that you could have found\\nanything in lyme to inspire such a feeling  the horror and distress\\nyou were involved in the stretch of mind the wear of spirits\\ni should have thought your last impressions of lyme must have been\\nstrong disgust\\n\\nthe last hours were certainly very painful replied anne\\nbut when pain is over the remembrance of it often becomes a pleasure\\none does not love a place the less for having suffered in it\\nunless it has been all suffering nothing but suffering which was\\nby no means the case at lyme  we were only in anxiety and distress\\nduring the last two hours and previously there had been a great deal\\nof enjoyment  so much novelty and beauty i have travelled so little\\nthat every fresh place would be interesting to me but there is real beauty\\nat lyme and in short with a faint blush at some recollections\\naltogether my impressions of the place are very agreeable\\n\\nas she ceased the entrance door opened again and the very party appeared\\nfor whom they were waiting  lady dalrymple lady dalrymple\\nwas the rejoicing sound and with all the eagerness compatible\\nwith anxious elegance sir walter and his two ladies stepped forward\\nto meet her  lady dalrymple and miss carteret escorted by mr elliot\\nand colonel wallis who had happened to arrive nearly at the same instant\\nadvanced into the room  the others joined them and it was\\na group in which anne found herself also necessarily included\\nshe was divided from captain wentworth  their interesting\\nalmost too interesting conversation must be broken up for a time\\nbut slight was the penance compared with the happiness which brought it on\\nshe had learnt in the last ten minutes more of his feelings\\ntowards louisa more of all his feelings than she dared to think of\\nand she gave herself up to the demands of the party to the needful\\ncivilities of the moment with exquisite though agitated sensations\\nshe was in good humour with all  she had received ideas which\\ndisposed her to be courteous and kind to all and to pity every one\\nas being less happy than herself\\n\\nthe delightful emotions were a little subdued when on stepping back\\nfrom the group to be joined again by captain wentworth she saw\\nthat he was gone  she was just in time to see him turn into\\nthe concert room  he was gone he had disappeared she felt\\na moments regret  but they should meet again  he would look for her\\nhe would find her out before the evening were over and at present\\nperhaps it was as well to be asunder  she was in need of\\na little interval for recollection\\n\\nupon lady russells appearance soon afterwards the whole party\\nwas collected and all that remained was to marshal themselves\\nand proceed into the concert room and be of all the consequence\\nin their power draw as many eyes excite as many whispers\\nand disturb as many people as they could\\n\\nvery very happy were both elizabeth and anne elliot as they walked in\\nelizabeth arm in arm with miss carteret and looking on the broad back\\nof the dowager viscountess dalrymple before her had nothing to wish for\\nwhich did not seem within her reach and annebut it would be\\nan insult to the nature of annes felicity to draw any comparison\\nbetween it and her sisters the origin of one all selfish vanity\\nof the other all generous attachment\\n\\nanne saw nothing thought nothing of the brilliancy of the room\\nher happiness was from within  her eyes were bright and her cheeks glowed\\nbut she knew nothing about it  she was thinking only of\\nthe last half hour and as they passed to their seats her mind took\\na hasty range over it  his choice of subjects his expressions\\nand still more his manner and look had been such as she could see\\nin only one light  his opinion of louisa musgroves inferiority\\nan opinion which he had seemed solicitous to give his wonder\\nat captain benwick his feelings as to a first strong attachment\\nsentences begun which he could not finish his half averted eyes\\nand more than half expressive glance all all declared that he had\\na heart returning to her at least that anger resentment avoidance\\nwere no more and that they were succeeded not merely by friendship\\nand regard but by the tenderness of the past  yes some share of\\nthe tenderness of the past  she could not contemplate the change\\nas implying less  he must love her\\n\\nthese were thoughts with their attendant visions which occupied\\nand flurried her too much to leave her any power of observation\\nand she passed along the room without having a glimpse of him\\nwithout even trying to discern him  when their places were determined on\\nand they were all properly arranged she looked round to see\\nif he should happen to be in the same part of the room but he was not\\nher eye could not reach him and the concert being just opening\\nshe must consent for a time to be happy in a humbler way\\n\\nthe party was divided and disposed of on two contiguous benches\\nanne was among those on the foremost and mr elliot had manoeuvred so well\\nwith the assistance of his friend colonel wallis as to have a seat by her\\nmiss elliot surrounded by her cousins and the principal object\\nof colonel walliss gallantry was quite contented\\n\\nannes mind was in a most favourable state for the entertainment\\nof the evening it was just occupation enough  she had feelings for\\nthe tender spirits for the gay attention for the scientific\\nand patience for the wearisome and had never liked a concert better\\nat least during the first act  towards the close of it\\nin the interval succeeding an italian song she explained\\nthe words of the song to mr elliot  they had a concert bill between them\\n\\nthis said she is nearly the sense or rather the meaning of the words\\nfor certainly the sense of an italian lovesong must not be talked of\\nbut it is as nearly the meaning as i can give for i do not pretend\\nto understand the language  i am a very poor italian scholar\\n\\nyes yes i see you are  i see you know nothing of the matter\\nyou have only knowledge enough of the language to translate at sight\\nthese inverted transposed curtailed italian lines into clear\\ncomprehensible elegant english  you need not say anything more\\nof your ignorance  here is complete proof\\n\\ni will not oppose such kind politeness but i should be sorry to be\\nexamined by a real proficient\\n\\ni have not had the pleasure of visiting in camden place so long\\nreplied he without knowing something of miss anne elliot\\nand i do regard her as one who is too modest for the world in general\\nto be aware of half her accomplishments and too highly accomplished\\nfor modesty to be natural in any other woman\\n\\nfor shame for shame this is too much flattery  i forget what we are\\nto have next turning to the bill\\n\\nperhaps said mr elliot speaking low i have had a longer acquaintance\\nwith your character than you are aware of\\n\\nindeed  how so  you can have been acquainted with it only since\\ni came to bath excepting as you might hear me previously spoken of\\nin my own family\\n\\ni knew you by report long before you came to bath  i had heard you\\ndescribed by those who knew you intimately  i have been acquainted\\nwith you by character many years  your person your disposition\\naccomplishments manner they were all present to me\\n\\nmr elliot was not disappointed in the interest he hoped to raise\\nno one can withstand the charm of such a mystery  to have been\\ndescribed long ago to a recent acquaintance by nameless people\\nis irresistible and anne was all curiosity  she wondered\\nand questioned him eagerly but in vain  he delighted in being asked\\nbut he would not tell\\n\\nno no some time or other perhaps but not now  he would mention\\nno names now but such he could assure her had been the fact\\nhe had many years ago received such a description of miss anne elliot\\nas had inspired him with the highest idea of her merit and excited\\nthe warmest curiosity to know her\\n\\nanne could think of no one so likely to have spoken with\\npartiality of her many years ago as the mr wentworth of monkford\\ncaptain wentworths brother  he might have been in mr elliots company\\nbut she had not courage to ask the question\\n\\nthe name of anne elliot said he has long had an interesting sound to me\\nvery long has it possessed a charm over my fancy and if i dared\\ni would breathe my wishes that the name might never change\\n\\nsuch she believed were his words but scarcely had she\\nreceived their sound than her attention was caught by other sounds\\nimmediately behind her which rendered every thing else trivial\\nher father and lady dalrymple were speaking\\n\\na welllooking man said sir walter a very welllooking man\\n\\na very fine young man indeed said lady dalrymple  more air\\nthan one often sees in bath  irish i dare say\\n\\nno i just know his name  a bowing acquaintance  wentworth\\ncaptain wentworth of the navy  his sister married my tenant\\nin somersetshire the croft who rents kellynch\\n\\nbefore sir walter had reached this point annes eyes had caught\\nthe right direction and distinguished captain wentworth standing\\namong a cluster of men at a little distance  as her eyes fell on him\\nhis seemed to be withdrawn from her  it had that appearance\\nit seemed as if she had been one moment too late and as long as she\\ndared observe he did not look again  but the performance\\nwas recommencing and she was forced to seem to restore her attention\\nto the orchestra and look straight forward\\n\\nwhen she could give another glance he had moved away  he could not have\\ncome nearer to her if he would she was so surrounded and shut in\\nbut she would rather have caught his eye\\n\\nmr elliots speech too distressed her  she had no longer\\nany inclination to talk to him  she wished him not so near her\\n\\nthe first act was over  now she hoped for some beneficial change\\nand after a period of nothingsaying amongst the party some of them\\ndid decide on going in quest of tea  anne was one of the few who\\ndid not choose to move  she remained in her seat and so did lady russell\\nbut she had the pleasure of getting rid of mr elliot and she did not mean\\nwhatever she might feel on lady russells account to shrink from\\nconversation with captain wentworth if he gave her the opportunity\\nshe was persuaded by lady russells countenance that she had seen him\\n\\nhe did not come however  anne sometimes fancied she discerned him\\nat a distance but he never came  the anxious interval\\nwore away unproductively  the others returned the room filled again\\nbenches were reclaimed and repossessed and another hour of pleasure\\nor of penance was to be sat out another hour of music was to give\\ndelight or the gapes as real or affected taste for it prevailed\\nto anne it chiefly wore the prospect of an hour of agitation\\nshe could not quit that room in peace without seeing captain wentworth\\nonce more without the interchange of one friendly look\\n\\nin resettling themselves there were now many changes the result of which\\nwas favourable for her  colonel wallis declined sitting down again\\nand mr elliot was invited by elizabeth and miss carteret in a manner\\nnot to be refused to sit between them and by some other removals\\nand a little scheming of her own  anne was enabled to place herself\\nmuch nearer the end of the bench than she had been before\\nmuch more within reach of a passerby  she could not do so\\nwithout comparing herself with miss larolles the inimitable miss larolles\\nbut still she did it and not with much happier effect\\nthough by what seemed prosperity in the shape of an early abdication\\nin her next neighbours she found herself at the very end of the bench\\nbefore the concert closed\\n\\nsuch was her situation with a vacant space at hand when captain wentworth\\nwas again in sight  she saw him not far off  he saw her too\\nyet he looked grave and seemed irresolute and only by very slow degrees\\ncame at last near enough to speak to her  she felt that something\\nmust be the matter  the change was indubitable  the difference\\nbetween his present air and what it had been in the octagon room\\nwas strikingly great  why was it  she thought of her father\\nof lady russell  could there have been any unpleasant glances\\nhe began by speaking of the concert gravely more like the captain\\nwentworth of uppercross owned himself disappointed had expected singing\\nand in short must confess that he should not be sorry when it was over\\nanne replied and spoke in defence of the performance so well\\nand yet in allowance for his feelings so pleasantly that his countenance\\nimproved and he replied again with almost a smile  they talked\\nfor a few minutes more the improvement held he even looked down\\ntowards the bench as if he saw a place on it well worth occupying\\nwhen at that moment a touch on her shoulder obliged anne to turn round\\nit came from mr elliot  he begged her pardon but she must be applied to\\nto explain italian again  miss carteret was very anxious to have\\na general idea of what was next to be sung  anne could not refuse\\nbut never had she sacrificed to politeness with a more suffering spirit\\n\\na few minutes though as few as possible were inevitably consumed\\nand when her own mistress again when able to turn and look\\nas she had done before she found herself accosted by captain wentworth\\nin a reserved yet hurried sort of farewell  he must wish her good night\\nhe was going he should get home as fast as he could\\n\\nis not this song worth staying for said anne suddenly struck\\nby an idea which made her yet more anxious to be encouraging\\n\\nno he replied impressively there is nothing worth my staying for\\nand he was gone directly\\n\\njealousy of mr elliot  it was the only intelligible motive\\ncaptain wentworth jealous of her affection  could she have believed it\\na week ago three hours ago  for a moment the gratification was exquisite\\nbut alas there were very different thoughts to succeed\\nhow was such jealousy to be quieted  how was the truth to reach him\\nhow in all the peculiar disadvantages of their respective situations\\nwould he ever learn of her real sentiments  it was misery to think\\nof mr elliots attentions  their evil was incalculable\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter

to avoid\\nmr elliot was almost a first object\\n\\nshe felt a great deal of goodwill towards him  in spite of\\nthe mischief of his attentions she owed him gratitude and regard\\nperhaps compassion  she could not help thinking much of the extraordinary\\ncircumstances attending their acquaintance of the right which\\nhe seemed to have to interest her by everything in situation\\nby his own sentiments by his early prepossession  it was altogether\\nvery extraordinary flattering but painful  there was much to regret\\nhow she might have felt had there been no captain wentworth in the case\\nwas not worth enquiry for there was a captain wentworth\\nand be the conclusion of the present suspense good or bad\\nher affection would be his for ever  their union she believed\\ncould not divide her more from other men than their final separation\\n\\nprettier musings of highwrought love and eternal constancy\\ncould never have passed along the streets of bath than anne\\nwas sporting with from camden place to westgate buildings\\nit was almost enough to spread purification and perfume all the way\\n\\nshe was sure of a pleasant reception and her friend seemed this morning\\nparticularly obliged to her for coming seemed hardly to have expected her\\nthough it had been an appointment\\n\\nan account of the concert was immediately claimed and annes recollections\\nof the concert were quite happy enough to animate her features\\nand make her rejoice to talk of it  all that she could tell\\nshe told most gladly but the all was little for one who had been there\\nand unsatisfactory for such an enquirer as mrs smith who had\\nalready heard through the short cut of a laundress and a waiter\\nrather more of the general success and produce of the evening\\nthan anne could relate and who now asked in vain for several particulars\\nof the company  everybody of any consequence or notoriety in bath\\nwas well know by name to mrs smith\\n\\nthe little durands were there i conclude said she with their mouths\\nopen to catch the music like unfledged sparrows ready to be fed\\nthey never miss a concert\\n\\nyes i did not see them myself but i heard mr elliot say they were\\nin the room\\n\\nthe ibbotsons were they there and the two new beauties\\nwith the tall irish officer who is talked of for one of them\\n\\ni do not know  i do not think they were\\n\\nold lady mary maclean  i need not ask after her  she never misses\\ni know and you must have seen her  she must have been in your own circle\\nfor as you went with lady dalrymple you were in the seats of grandeur\\nround the orchestra of course\\n\\nno that was what i dreaded  it would have been very unpleasant to me\\nin every respect  but happily lady dalrymple always chooses\\nto be farther off and we were exceedingly well placed that is\\nfor hearing i must not say for seeing because i appear to have seen\\nvery little\\n\\noh you saw enough for your own amusement  i can understand\\nthere is a sort of domestic enjoyment to be known even in a crowd\\nand this you had  you were a large party in yourselves\\nand you wanted nothing beyond\\n\\nbut i ought to have looked about me more said anne conscious\\nwhile she spoke that there had in fact been no want of looking about\\nthat the object only had been deficient\\n\\nno no you were better employed  you need not tell me that you\\nhad a pleasant evening  i see it in your eye  i perfectly see\\nhow the hours passed  that you had always something agreeable\\nto listen to  in the intervals of the concert it was conversation\\n\\nanne half smiled and said do you see that in my eye\\n\\nyes i do  your countenance perfectly informs me that you were\\nin company last night with the person whom you think the most agreeable\\nin the world the person who interests you at this present time\\nmore than all the rest of the world put together\\n\\na blush overspread annes cheeks  she could say nothing\\n\\nand such being the case continued mrs smith after a short pause\\ni hope you believe that i do know how to value your kindness\\nin coming to me this morning  it is really very good of you\\nto come and sit with me when you must have so many pleasanter demands\\nupon your time\\n\\nanne heard nothing of this  she was still in the astonishment and\\nconfusion excited by her friends penetration unable to imagine\\nhow any report of captain wentworth could have reached her\\nafter another short silence\\n\\npray said mrs smith is mr elliot aware of your acquaintance with me\\ndoes he know that i am in bath\\n\\nmr elliot repeated anne looking up surprised  a moments reflection\\nshewed her the mistake she had been under  she caught it instantaneously\\nand recovering her courage with the feeling of safety soon added\\nmore composedly are you acquainted with mr elliot\\n\\ni have been a good deal acquainted with him replied mrs smith gravely\\nbut it seems worn out now  it is a great while since we met\\n\\ni was not at all aware of this  you never mentioned it before\\nhad i known it i would have had the pleasure of talking to him about you\\n\\nto confess the truth said mrs smith assuming her usual\\nair of cheerfulness that is exactly the pleasure i want you to have\\ni want you to talk about me to mr elliot  i want your interest with him\\nhe can be of essential service to me and if you would have the goodness\\nmy dear miss elliot to make it an object to yourself\\nof course it is done\\n\\ni should be extremely happy i hope you cannot doubt my willingness\\nto be of even the slightest use to you replied anne but i suspect\\nthat you are considering me as having a higher claim on mr elliot\\na greater right to influence him than is really the case\\ni am sure you have somehow or other imbibed such a notion\\nyou must consider me only as mr elliots relation  if in that light\\nthere is anything which you suppose his cousin might fairly ask of him\\ni beg you would not hesitate to employ me\\n\\nmrs smith gave her a penetrating glance and then smiling said\\n\\ni have been a little premature i perceive i beg your pardon\\ni ought to have waited for official information  but now my dear\\nmiss elliot as an old friend do give me a hint as to when i may speak\\nnext week  to be sure by next week i may be allowed to\\nthink it all settled and build my own selfish schemes on\\nmr elliots good fortune\\n\\nno replied anne nor next week nor next nor next\\ni assure you that nothing of the sort you are thinking of\\nwill be settled any week  i am not going to marry mr elliot\\ni should like to know why you imagine i am\\n\\nmrs smith looked at her again looked earnestly smiled\\nshook her head and exclaimed\\n\\nnow how i do wish i understood you  how i do wish i knew\\nwhat you were at  i have a great idea that you do not design to be cruel\\nwhen the right moment occurs  till it does come you know\\nwe women never mean to have anybody  it is a thing of course among us\\nthat every man is refused till he offers  but why should you be cruel\\nlet me plead for mypresent friend i cannot call him but for\\nmy former friend  where can you look for a more suitable match\\nwhere could you expect a more gentlemanlike agreeable man\\nlet me recommend mr elliot  i am sure you hear nothing but good of him\\nfrom colonel wallis and who can know him better than colonel wallis\\n\\nmy dear mrs smith mr elliots wife has not been dead much above\\nhalf a year  he ought not to be supposed to be paying his addresses\\nto any one\\n\\noh if these are your only objections cried mrs smith archly\\nmr elliot is safe and i shall give myself no more trouble about him\\ndo not forget me when you are married thats all  let him know me to be\\na friend of yours and then he will think little of the trouble required\\nwhich it is very natural for him now with so many affairs and engagements\\nof his own to avoid and get rid of as he can very natural perhaps\\nninetynine out of a hundred would do the same  of course\\nhe cannot be aware of the importance to me  well my dear miss elliot\\ni hope and trust you will be very happy  mr elliot has sense\\nto understand the value of such a woman  your peace will not be\\nshipwrecked as mine has been  you are safe in all worldly matters\\nand safe in his character  he will not be led astray he will not be\\nmisled by others to his ruin\\n\\nno said anne i can readily believe all that of my cousin\\nhe seems to have a calm decided temper not at all open\\nto dangerous impressions  i consider him with great respect\\ni have no reason from any thing that has fallen within my observation\\nto do otherwise  but i have not known him long and he is not a man\\ni think to be known intimately soon  will not this manner\\nof speaking of him mrs smith convince you that he is nothing to me\\nsurely this must be calm enough  and upon my word he is nothing to me\\nshould he ever propose to me which i have very little reason to imagine\\nhe has any thought of doing i shall not accept him  i assure you\\ni shall not  i assure you mr elliot had not the share which\\nyou have been supposing in whatever pleasure the concert\\nof last night might afford  not mr elliot it is not mr elliot that\\n\\nshe stopped regretting with a deep blush that she had implied so much\\nbut less would hardly have been sufficient  mrs smith would hardly\\nhave believed so soon in mr elliots failure but from the perception\\nof there being a somebody else  as it was she instantly submitted\\nand with all the semblance of seeing nothing beyond and anne\\neager to escape farther notice was impatient to know why mrs smith\\nshould have fancied she was to marry mr elliot where she could have\\nreceived the idea or from whom she could have heard it\\n\\ndo tell me how it first came into your head\\n\\nit first came into my head replied mrs smith upon finding how much\\nyou were together and feeling it to be the most probable thing\\nin the world to be wished for by everybody belonging to either of you\\nand you may depend upon it that all your acquaintance have disposed of you\\nin the same way  but i never heard it spoken of till two days ago\\n\\nand has it indeed been spoken of\\n\\ndid you observe the woman who opened the door to you when\\nyou called yesterday\\n\\nno  was not it mrs speed as usual or the maid  i observed\\nno one in particular\\n\\nit was my friend mrs rooke nurse rooke who bythebye\\nhad a great curiosity to see you and was delighted to be in the way\\nto let you in  she came away from marlborough buildings only on sunday\\nand she it was who told me you were to marry mr elliot\\nshe had had it from mrs wallis herself which did not seem bad authority\\nshe sat an hour with me on monday evening and gave me the whole history\\nthe whole history repeated anne laughing  she could not make\\na very long history i think of one such little article\\nof unfounded news\\n\\nmrs smith said nothing\\n\\nbut continued anne presently though there is no truth in my having\\nthis claim on mr elliot i should be extremely happy to be of use to you\\nin any way that i could  shall i mention to him your being in bath\\nshall i take any message\\n\\nno i thank you  no certainly not  in the warmth of the moment\\nand under a mistaken impression i might perhaps have endeavoured\\nto interest you in some circumstances but not now  no i thank you\\ni have nothing to trouble you with\\n\\ni think you spoke of having known mr elliot many years\\n\\ni did\\n\\nnot before he was married i suppose\\n\\nyes he was not married when i knew him first\\n\\nandwere you much acquainted\\n\\nintimately\\n\\nindeed  then do tell me what he was at that time of life\\ni have a great curiosity to know what mr elliot was as a very young man\\nwas he at all such as he appears now\\n\\ni have not seen mr elliot these three years was mrs smiths answer\\ngiven so gravely that it was impossible to pursue the subject farther\\nand anne felt that she had gained nothing but an increase of curiosity\\nthey were both silent  mrs smith very thoughtful  at last\\n\\ni beg your pardon my dear miss elliot she cried in her\\nnatural tone of cordiality i beg your pardon for the short answers\\ni have been giving you but i have been uncertain what i ought to do\\ni have been doubting and considering as to what i ought to tell you\\nthere were many things to be taken into the account  one hates\\nto be officious to be giving bad impressions making mischief\\neven the smooth surface of familyunion seems worth preserving\\nthough there may be nothing durable beneath  however i have determined\\ni think i am right i think you ought to be made acquainted\\nwith mr elliots real character  though i fully believe that\\nat present you have not the smallest intention of accepting him\\nthere is no saying what may happen  you might some time or other\\nbe differently affected towards him  hear the truth therefore\\nnow while you are unprejudiced  mr elliot is a man without heart\\nor conscience a designing wary coldblooded being who thinks\\nonly of himself whom for his own interest or ease would be guilty\\nof any cruelty or any treachery that could be perpetrated without\\nrisk of his general character  he has no feeling for others\\nthose whom he has been the chief cause of leading into ruin\\nhe can neglect and desert without the smallest compunction\\nhe is totally beyond the reach of any sentiment of justice or compassion\\noh he is black at heart hollow and black\\n\\nannes astonished air and exclamation of wonder made her pause\\nand in a calmer manner she added\\n\\nmy expressions startle you  you must allow for an injured angry woman\\nbut i will try to command myself  i will not abuse him\\ni will only tell you what i have found him  facts shall speak\\nhe was the intimate friend of my dear husband who trusted and loved him\\nand thought him as good as himself  the intimacy had been formed\\nbefore our marriage  i found them most intimate friends and i too\\nbecame excessively pleased with mr elliot and entertained\\nthe highest opinion of him  at nineteen you know one does not\\nthink very seriously but mr elliot appeared to me quite as good as others\\nand much more agreeable than most others and we were almost\\nalways together  we were principally in town living in very good style\\nhe was then the inferior in circumstances he was then the poor one\\nhe had chambers in the temple and it was as much as he could do\\nto support the appearance of a gentleman  he had always a home\\nwith us whenever he chose it he was always welcome he was like a brother\\nmy poor charles who had the finest most generous spirit in the world\\nwould have divided his last farthing with him and i know that his purse\\nwas open to him i know that he often assisted him\\n\\nthis must have been about that very period of mr elliots life\\nsaid anne which has always excited my particular curiosity\\nit must have been about the same time that he became known to\\nmy father and sister  i never knew him myself i only heard of him\\nbut there was a something in his conduct then with regard to\\nmy father and sister and afterwards in the circumstances of his marriage\\nwhich i never could quite reconcile with present times  it seemed\\nto announce a different sort of man\\n\\ni know it all i know it all cried mrs smith  he had been\\nintroduced to sir walter and your sister before i was acquainted with him\\nbut i heard him speak of them for ever  i know he was invited\\nand encouraged and i know he did not choose to go  i can satisfy you\\nperhaps on points which you would little expect and as to his marriage\\ni knew all about it at the time  i was privy to all the fors and againsts\\ni was the friend to whom he confided his hopes and plans and though\\ni did not know his wife previously her inferior situation in society\\nindeed rendered that impossible yet i knew her all her life afterwards\\nor at least till within the last two years of her life and can answer\\nany question you may wish to put\\n\\nnay said anne i have no particular enquiry to make about her\\ni have always understood they were not a happy couple  but i should\\nlike to know why at that time of his life he should slight\\nmy fathers acquaintance as he did  my father was certainly disposed\\nto take very kind and proper notice of him  why did mr elliot draw back\\n\\nmr elliot replied mrs smith at that period of his life\\nhad one object in view  to make his fortune and by a rather quicker\\nprocess than the law  he was determined to make it by marriage\\nhe was determined at least not to mar it by an imprudent marriage\\nand i know it was his belief whether justly or not of course\\ni cannot decide that your father and sister in their civilities\\nand invitations were designing a match between the heir\\nand the young lady and it was impossible that such a match\\nshould have answered his ideas of wealth and independence\\nthat was his motive for drawing back i can assure you\\nhe told me the whole story  he had no concealments with me\\nit was curious that having just left you behind me in bath\\nmy first and principal acquaintance on marrying should be your cousin\\nand that through him i should be continually hearing of your father\\nand sister  he described one miss elliot and i thought\\nvery affectionately of the other\\n\\nperhaps cried anne struck by a sudden idea you sometimes\\nspoke of me to mr elliot\\n\\nto be sure i did very often  i used to boast of my own anne elliot\\nand vouch for your being a very different creature from\\n\\nshe checked herself just in time\\n\\nthis accounts for something which mr elliot said last night\\ncried anne  this explains it  i found he had been used to hear of me\\ni could not comprehend how  what wild imaginations one forms where\\ndear self is concerned  how sure to be mistaken  but i beg your pardon\\ni have interrupted you  mr elliot married then completely for money\\nthe circumstances probably which first opened your eyes\\nto his character\\n\\nmrs smith hesitated a little here  oh those things are too common\\nwhen one lives in the world a man or womans marrying for money\\nis too common to strike one as it ought  i was very young\\nand associated only with the young and we were a thoughtless\\ngay set without any strict rules of conduct  we lived for enjoyment\\ni think differently now time and sickness and sorrow have given me\\nother notions but at that period i must own i saw nothing reprehensible\\nin what mr elliot was doing  to do the best for himself\\npassed as a duty\\n\\nbut was not she a very low woman\\n\\nyes which i objected to but he would not regard  money money\\nwas all that he wanted  her father was a grazier her grandfather\\nhad been a butcher but that was all nothing  she was a fine woman\\nhad had a decent education was brought forward by some cousins\\nthrown by chance into mr elliots company and fell in love with him\\nand not a difficulty or a scruple was there on his side\\nwith respect to her birth  all his caution was spent in being secured\\nof the real amount of her fortune before he committed himself\\ndepend upon it whatever esteem mr elliot may have for his own situation\\nin life now as a young man he had not the smallest value for it\\nhis chance for the kellynch estate was something but all the honour\\nof the family he held as cheap as dirt  i have often heard him declare\\nthat if baronetcies were saleable anybody should have his\\nfor fifty pounds arms and motto name and livery included\\nbut i will not pretend to repeat half that i used to hear him say\\non that subject  it would not be fair and yet you ought to have proof\\nfor what is all this but assertion and you shall have proof\\n\\nindeed my dear mrs smith i want none cried anne  you have asserted\\nnothing contradictory to what mr elliot appeared to be some years ago\\nthis is all in confirmation rather of what we used to hear and believe\\ni am more curious to know why he should be so different now\\n\\nbut for my satisfaction if you will have the goodness to ring for mary\\nstay  i am sure you will have the still greater goodness of\\ngoing yourself into my bedroom and bringing me the small inlaid box\\nwhich you will find on the upper shelf of the closet\\n\\nanne seeing her friend to be earnestly bent on it did as she was desired\\nthe box was brought and placed before her and mrs smith sighing over it\\nas she unlocked it said\\n\\nthis is full of papers belonging to him to my husband\\na small portion only of what i had to look over when i lost him\\nthe letter i am looking for was one written by mr elliot to him\\nbefore our marriage and happened to be saved why one can hardly imagine\\nbut he was careless and immethodical like other men about those things\\nand when i came to examine his papers i found it with others\\nstill more trivial from different people scattered here and there\\nwhile many letters and memorandums of real importance had been destroyed\\nhere it is i would not burn it because being even then very little\\nsatisfied with mr elliot i was determined to preserve every document\\nof former intimacy  i have now another motive for being glad\\nthat i can produce it\\n\\nthis was the letter directed to charles smith esq tunbridge wells\\nand dated from london as far back as july 1803 \\n\\ndear smithi have received yours  your kindness almost overpowers me\\ni wish nature had made such hearts as yours more common but i have\\nlived threeandtwenty years in the world and have seen none like it\\nat present believe me i have no need of your services\\nbeing in cash again  give me joy  i have got rid of sir walter and miss\\nthey are gone back to kellynch and almost made me swear to visit them\\nthis summer but my first visit to kellynch will be with a surveyor\\nto tell me how to bring it with best advantage to the hammer\\nthe baronet nevertheless is not unlikely to marry again\\nhe is quite fool enough  if he does however they will leave me in peace\\nwhich may be a decent equivalent  for the reversion  he is worse\\nthan last year\\n\\ni wish i had any name but elliot  i am sick of it  the name of walter\\ni can drop thank god and i desire you will never insult me\\nwith my second w again meaning for the rest of my life\\nto be only yours trulywm elliot\\n\\nsuch a letter could not be read without putting anne in a glow\\nand mrs smith observing the high colour in her face said\\n\\nthe language i know is highly disrespectful  though i have forgot\\nthe exact terms i have a perfect impression of the general meaning\\nbut it shows you the man  mark his professions to my poor husband\\ncan any thing be stronger\\n\\nanne could not immediately get over the shock and mortification\\nof finding such words applied to her father  she was obliged to recollect\\nthat her seeing the letter was a violation of the laws of honour\\nthat no one ought to be judged or to be known by such testimonies\\nthat no private correspondence could bear the eye of others\\nbefore she could recover calmness enough to return the letter\\nwhich she had been meditating over and say\\n\\nthank you  this is full proof undoubtedly proof of every thing\\nyou were saying  but why be acquainted with us now\\n\\ni can explain this too cried mrs smith smiling\\n\\ncan you really\\n\\nyes  i have shewn you mr elliot as he was a dozen years ago\\nand i will shew him as he is now  i cannot produce written proof again\\nbut i can give as authentic oral testimony as you can desire of what\\nhe is now wanting and what he is now doing  he is no hypocrite now\\nhe truly wants to marry you  his present attentions to your family\\nare very sincere  quite from the heart  i will give you my authority\\nhis friend colonel wallis\\n\\ncolonel wallis you are acquainted with him\\n\\nno  it does not come to me in quite so direct a line as that\\nit takes a bend or two but nothing of consequence  the stream\\nis as good as at first the little rubbish it collects in the turnings\\nis easily moved away  mr elliot talks unreservedly to colonel wallis\\nof his views on you which said colonel wallis i imagine to be\\nin himself a sensible careful discerning sort of character\\nbut colonel wallis has a very pretty silly wife to whom\\nhe tells things which he had better not and he repeats it all to her\\nshe in the overflowing spirits of her recovery repeats it all\\nto her nurse and the nurse  knowing my acquaintance with you\\nvery naturally brings it all to me  on monday evening my good friend\\nmrs rooke let me thus much into the secrets of marlborough buildings\\nwhen i talked of a whole history therefore you see i was\\nnot romancing so much as you supposed\\n\\nmy dear mrs smith your authority is deficient  this will not do\\nmr elliots having any views on me will not in the least account\\nfor the efforts he made towards a reconciliation with my father\\nthat was all prior to my coming to bath  i found them on\\nthe most friendly terms when i arrived\\n\\ni know you did i know it all perfectly but\\n\\nindeed mrs smith we must not expect to get real information\\nin such a line  facts or opinions which are to pass through the hands\\nof so many to be misconceived by folly in one and ignorance in another\\ncan hardly have much truth left\\n\\nonly give me a hearing  you will soon be able to judge of\\nthe general credit due by listening to some particulars\\nwhich you can yourself immediately contradict or confirm\\nnobody supposes that you were his first inducement  he had seen you\\nindeed before he came to bath and admired you but without\\nknowing it to be you  so says my historian at least  is this true\\ndid he see you last summer or autumn somewhere down in the west\\nto use her own words without knowing it to be you\\n\\nhe certainly did  so far it is very true  at lyme\\ni happened to be at lyme\\n\\nwell continued mrs smith triumphantly grant my friend the credit\\ndue to the establishment of the first point asserted  he saw you then\\nat lyme and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleased\\nto meet with you again in camden place as miss anne elliot\\nand from that moment i have no doubt had a double motive\\nin his visits there  but there was another and an earlier\\nwhich i will now explain  if there is anything in my story which you know\\nto be either false or improbable stop me  my account states\\nthat your sisters friend the lady now staying with you\\nwhom i have heard you mention came to bath with miss elliot and sir walter\\nas long ago as september in short when they first came themselves\\nand has been staying there ever since that she is a clever insinuating\\nhandsome woman poor and plausible and altogether such in situation\\nand manner as to give a general idea among sir walters acquaintance\\nof her meaning to be lady elliot and as general a surprise\\nthat miss elliot should be apparently blind to the danger\\n\\nhere mrs smith paused a moment but anne had not a word to say\\nand she continued\\n\\nthis was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family\\nlong before you returned to it and colonel wallis had his eye\\nupon your father enough to be sensible of it though he did not then\\nvisit in camden place but his regard for mr elliot gave him an interest\\nin watching all that was going on there and when mr elliot came to bath\\nfor a day or two as he happened to do a little before christmas\\ncolonel wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of things\\nand the reports beginning to prevail  now you are to understand\\nthat time had worked a very material change in mr elliots opinions\\nas to the value of a baronetcy  upon all points of blood and connexion\\nhe is a completely altered man  having long had as much money\\nas he could spend nothing to wish for on the side of avarice\\nor indulgence he has been gradually learning to pin his happiness\\nupon the consequence he is heir to  i thought it coming on\\nbefore our acquaintance ceased but it is now a confirmed feeling\\nhe cannot bear the idea of not being sir william  you may guess\\ntherefore that the news he heard from his friend could not be\\nvery agreeable and you may guess what it produced the resolution\\nof coming back to bath as soon as possible and of fixing himself here\\nfor a time with the view of renewing his former acquaintance\\nand recovering such a footing in the family as might give him the means\\nof ascertaining the degree of his danger and of circumventing the lady\\nif he found it material  this was agreed upon between the two friends\\nas the only thing to be done and colonel wallis was to assist\\nin every way that he could  he was to be introduced and mrs wallis\\nwas to be introduced and everybody was to be introduced\\nmr elliot came back accordingly and on application was forgiven\\nas you know and readmitted into the family and there it was\\nhis constant object and his only object till your arrival\\nadded another motive to watch sir walter and mrs clay\\nhe omitted no opportunity of being with them threw himself in their way\\ncalled at all hours but i need not be particular on this subject\\nyou can imagine what an artful man would do and with this guide\\nperhaps may recollect what you have seen him do\\n\\nyes said anne you tell me nothing which does not accord with\\nwhat i have known or could imagine  there is always something offensive\\nin the details of cunning  the manoeuvres of selfishness and duplicity\\nmust ever be revolting but i have heard nothing which really surprises me\\ni know those who would be shocked by such a representation of mr elliot\\nwho would have difficulty in believing it but i have never been satisfied\\ni have always wanted some other motive for his conduct than appeared\\ni should like to know his present opinion as to the probability\\nof the event he has been in dread of whether he considers the danger\\nto be lessening or not\\n\\nlessening i understand replied mrs smith  he thinks mrs clay\\nafraid of him aware that he sees through her and not daring to proceed\\nas she might do in his absence  but since he must be absent\\nsome time or other i do not perceive how he can ever be secure\\nwhile she holds her present influence  mrs wallis has an amusing idea\\nas nurse tells me that it is to be put into the marriage articles\\nwhen you and mr elliot marry that your father is not to marry mrs clay\\na scheme worthy of mrs walliss understanding by all accounts\\nbut my sensible nurse rooke sees the absurdity of it  why to be sure\\nmaam said she it would not prevent his marrying anybody else\\nand indeed to own the truth i do not think nurse in her heart\\nis a very strenuous opposer of sir walters making a second match\\nshe must be allowed to be a favourer of matrimony you know\\nand since self will intrude who can say that she may not have\\nsome flying visions of attending the next lady elliot through\\nmrs walliss recommendation\\n\\ni am very glad to know all this said anne after a little\\nthoughtfulness  it will be more painful to me in some respects\\nto be in company with him but i shall know better what to do\\nmy line of conduct will be more direct  mr elliot is evidently\\na disingenuous artificial worldly man who has never had\\nany better principle to guide him than selfishness\\n\\nbut mr elliot was not done with  mrs smith had been carried away\\nfrom her first direction and anne had forgotten in the interest\\nof her own family concerns how much had been originally implied\\nagainst him but her attention was now called to the explanation\\nof those first hints and she listened to a recital which\\nif it did not perfectly justify the unqualified bitterness of mrs smith\\nproved him to have been very unfeeling in his conduct towards her\\nvery deficient both in justice and compassion\\n\\nshe learned that the intimacy between them continuing unimpaired\\nby mr elliots marriage they had been as before always together\\nand mr elliot had led his friend into expenses much beyond his fortune\\nmrs smith did not want to take blame to herself and was most tender\\nof throwing any on her husband but anne could collect that their income\\nhad never been equal to their style of living and that from the first\\nthere had been a great deal of general and joint extravagance\\nfrom his wifes account of him she could discern mr smith to have been\\na man of warm feelings easy temper careless habits and not strong\\nunderstanding much more amiable than his friend and very unlike him\\nled by him and probably despised by him  mr elliot raised by\\nhis marriage to great affluence and disposed to every gratification\\nof pleasure and vanity which could be commanded without involving himself\\nfor with all his selfindulgence he had become a prudent man\\nand beginning to be rich just as his friend ought to have found himself\\nto be poor seemed to have had no concern at all for that friends\\nprobable finances but on the contrary had been prompting and\\nencouraging expenses which could end only in ruin and the smiths\\naccordingly had been ruined\\n\\nthe husband had died just in time to be spared the full knowledge of it\\nthey had previously known embarrassments enough to try the friendship\\nof their friends and to prove that mr elliots had better not be tried\\nbut it was not till his death that the wretched state of his affairs\\nwas fully known  with a confidence in mr elliots regard\\nmore creditable to his feelings than his judgement mr smith had\\nappointed him the executor of his will but mr elliot would not act\\nand the difficulties and distress which this refusal had heaped on her\\nin addition to the inevitable sufferings of her situation had been such\\nas could not be related without anguish of spirit or listened to\\nwithout corresponding indignation\\n\\nanne was shewn some letters of his on the occasion answers to\\nurgent applications from mrs smith which all breathed the same\\nstern resolution of not engaging in a fruitless trouble and\\nunder a cold civility the same hardhearted indifference\\nto any of the evils it might bring on her  it was a dreadful picture\\nof ingratitude and inhumanity and anne felt at some moments\\nthat no flagrant open crime could have been worse  she had a great deal\\nto listen to all the particulars of past sad scenes all the minutiae\\nof distress upon distress which in former conversations had been\\nmerely hinted at were dwelt on now with a natural indulgence\\nanne could perfectly comprehend the exquisite relief and was only\\nthe more inclined to wonder at the composure of her friends\\nusual state of mind\\n\\nthere was one circumstance in the history of her grievances\\nof particular irritation  she had good reason to believe that\\nsome property of her husband in the west indies which had been\\nfor many years under a sort of sequestration for the payment\\nof its own incumbrances might be recoverable by proper measures\\nand this property though not large would be enough to make\\nher comparatively rich  but there was nobody to stir in it\\nmr elliot would do nothing and she could do nothing herself\\nequally disabled from personal exertion by her state of\\nbodily weakness and from employing others by her want of money\\nshe had no natural connexions to assist her even with their counsel\\nand she could not afford to purchase the assistance of the law\\nthis was a cruel aggravation of actually straitened means\\nto feel that she ought to be in better circumstances\\nthat a little trouble in the right place might do it\\nand to fear that delay might be even weakening her claims\\nwas hard to bear\\n\\nit was on this point that she had hoped to engage annes good offices\\nwith mr elliot  she had previously in the anticipation\\nof their marriage been very apprehensive of losing her friend by it\\nbut on being assured that he could have made no attempt of that nature\\nsince he did not even know her to be in bath it immediately occurred\\nthat something might be done in her favour by the influence of the woman\\nhe loved and she had been hastily preparing to interest annes feelings\\nas far as the observances due to mr elliots character would allow\\nwhen annes refutation of the supposed engagement changed\\nthe face of everything and while it took from her the newformed hope\\nof succeeding in the object of her first anxiety left her at least\\nthe comfort of telling the whole story her own way\\n\\nafter listening to this full description of mr elliot anne could not but\\nexpress some surprise at mrs smiths having spoken of him so favourably\\nin the beginning of their conversation  she had seemed to recommend\\nand praise him\\n\\nmy dear was mrs smiths reply there was nothing else to be done\\ni considered your marrying him as certain though he might not yet\\nhave made the offer and i could no more speak the truth of him\\nthan if he had been your husband  my heart bled for you\\nas i talked of happiness and yet he is sensible he is agreeable\\nand with such a woman as you it was not absolutely hopeless\\nhe was very unkind to his first wife  they were wretched together\\nbut she was too ignorant and giddy for respect and he had never loved her\\ni was willing to hope that you must fare better\\n\\nanne could just acknowledge within herself such a possibility\\nof having been induced to marry him as made her shudder at the idea\\nof the misery which must have followed  it was just possible that\\nshe might have been persuaded by lady russell  and under such\\na supposition which would have been most miserable when time had\\ndisclosed all too late\\n\\nit was very desirable that lady russell should be no longer deceived\\nand one of the concluding arrangements of this important conference\\nwhich carried them through the greater part of the morning\\nwas that anne had full liberty to communicate to her friend\\neverything relative to mrs smith in which his conduct was involved\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 22\\n\\n\\nanne went home to think over all that she had heard  in one point\\nher feelings were relieved by this knowledge of mr elliot\\nthere was no longer anything of tenderness due to him  he stood as\\nopposed to captain wentworth in all his own unwelcome obtrusiveness\\nand the evil of his attentions last night the irremediable mischief\\nhe might have done was considered with sensations unqualified unperplexed\\npity for him was all over  but this was the only point of relief\\nin every other respect in looking around her or penetrating forward\\nshe saw more to distrust and to apprehend  she was concerned\\nfor the disappointment and pain lady russell would be feeling\\nfor the mortifications which must be hanging over her father and sister\\nand had all the distress of foreseeing many evils without knowing\\nhow to avert any one of them  she was most thankful for her own\\nknowledge of him  she had never considered herself as entitled to reward\\nfor not slighting an old friend like mrs smith but here was\\na reward indeed springing from it  mrs smith had been able to tell her\\nwhat no one else could have done  could the knowledge have\\nbeen extended through her family  but this was a vain idea\\nshe must talk to lady russell tell her consult with her\\nand having done her best wait the event with as much composure\\nas possible and after all her greatest want of composure would be\\nin that quarter of the mind which could not be opened to lady russell\\nin that flow of anxieties and fears which must be all to herself\\n\\n\\nshe found on reaching home that she had as she intended\\nescaped seeing mr elliot that he had called and paid them\\na long morning visit but hardly had she congratulated herself\\nand felt safe when she heard that he was coming again in the evening\\n\\ni had not the smallest intention of asking him said elizabeth\\nwith affected carelessness but he gave so many hints\\nso mrs clay says at least\\n\\nindeed i do say it  i never saw anybody in my life spell harder\\nfor an invitation  poor man  i was really in pain for him\\nfor your hardhearted sister miss anne seems bent on cruelty\\n\\noh cried elizabeth i have been rather too much used to the game\\nto be soon overcome by a gentlemans hints  however when i found\\nhow excessively he was regretting that he should miss my father\\nthis morning i gave way immediately for i would never really omit\\nan opportunity of bring him and sir walter together  they appear to\\nso much advantage in company with each other  each behaving so pleasantly\\nmr elliot looking up with so much respect\\n\\nquite delightful cried mrs clay not daring however\\nto turn her eyes towards anne  exactly like father and son\\ndear miss elliot may i not say father and son\\n\\noh i lay no embargo on any bodys words  if you will have such\\nideas  but upon my word i am scarcely sensible of his attentions\\nbeing beyond those of other men\\n\\nmy dear miss elliot exclaimed mrs clay lifting her hands and eyes\\nand sinking all the rest of her astonishment in a convenient silence\\n\\nwell my dear penelope you need not be so alarmed about him\\ni did invite him you know  i sent him away with smiles\\nwhen i found he was really going to his friends at thornberry park\\nfor the whole day tomorrow i had compassion on him\\n\\nanne admired the good acting of the friend in being able to shew\\nsuch pleasure as she did in the expectation and in the actual arrival\\nof the very person whose presence must really be interfering with\\nher prime object  it was impossible but that mrs clay must hate\\nthe sight of mr elliot and yet she could assume a most obliging\\nplacid look and appear quite satisfied with the curtailed license\\nof devoting herself only half as much to sir walter as she would have\\ndone otherwise\\n\\nto anne herself it was most distressing to see mr elliot enter the room\\nand quite painful to have him approach and speak to her\\nshe had been used before to feel that he could not be always quite sincere\\nbut now she saw insincerity in everything  his attentive deference\\nto her father contrasted with his former language was odious\\nand when she thought of his cruel conduct towards mrs smith\\nshe could hardly bear the sight of his present smiles and mildness\\nor the sound of his artificial good sentiments\\n\\nshe meant to avoid any such alteration of manners as might provoke\\na remonstrance on his side  it was a great object to her to escape\\nall enquiry or eclat but it was her intention to be as decidedly cool\\nto him as might be compatible with their relationship and to retrace\\nas quietly as she could the few steps of unnecessary intimacy she had\\nbeen gradually led along  she was accordingly more guarded\\nand more cool than she had been the night before\\n\\nhe wanted to animate her curiosity again as to how and where\\nhe could have heard her formerly praised wanted very much\\nto be gratified by more solicitation but the charm was broken\\nhe found that the heat and animation of a public room was necessary\\nto kindle his modest cousins vanity he found at least that it was\\nnot to be done now by any of those attempts which he could hazard\\namong the toocommanding claims of the others  he little surmised\\nthat it was a subject acting now exactly against his interest\\nbringing immediately to her thoughts all those parts of his conduct\\nwhich were least excusable\\n\\nshe had some satisfaction in finding that he was really going out of bath\\nthe next morning going early and that he would be gone the greater part\\nof two days  he was invited again to camden place the very evening of\\nhis return but from thursday to saturday evening his absence was certain\\nit was bad enough that a mrs clay should be always before her\\nbut that a deeper hypocrite should be added to their party\\nseemed the destruction of everything like peace and comfort\\nit was so humiliating to reflect on the constant deception practised\\non her father and elizabeth to consider the various sources\\nof mortification preparing for them  mrs clays selfishness was\\nnot so complicate nor so revolting as his and anne would have compounded\\nfor the marriage at once with all its evils to be clear of mr elliots\\nsubtleties in endeavouring to prevent it\\n\\non friday morning she meant to go very early to lady russell\\nand accomplish the necessary communication and she would have gone\\ndirectly after breakfast but that mrs clay was also going out\\non some obliging purpose of saving her sister trouble which\\ndetermined her to wait till she might be safe from such a companion\\nshe saw mrs clay fairly off therefore before she began to talk\\nof spending the morning in rivers street\\n\\nvery well said elizabeth i have nothing to send but my love\\noh you may as well take back that tiresome book she would lend me\\nand pretend i have read it through  i really cannot be plaguing myself\\nfor ever with all the new poems and states of the nation that come out\\nlady russell quite bores one with her new publications\\nyou need not tell her so but i thought her dress hideous the other night\\ni used to think she had some taste in dress but i was ashamed of her\\nat the concert  something so formal and arrange in her air\\nand she sits so upright  my best love of course\\n\\nand mine added sir walter  kindest regards  and you may say\\nthat i mean to call upon her soon  make a civil message\\nbut i shall only leave my card  morning visits are never fair\\nby women at her time of life who make themselves up so little\\nif she would only wear rouge she would not be afraid of being seen\\nbut last time i called i observed the blinds were let down immediately\\n\\nwhile her father spoke there was a knock at the door  who could it be\\nanne remembering the preconcerted visits at all hours of mr elliot\\nwould have expected him but for his known engagement seven miles off\\nafter the usual period of suspense the usual sounds of approach were heard\\nand mr and mrs charles musgrove were ushered into the room\\n\\nsurprise was the strongest emotion raised by their appearance\\nbut anne was really glad to see them and the others were not so sorry\\nbut that they could put on a decent air of welcome and as soon\\nas it became clear that these their nearest relations were not arrived\\nwith an views of accommodation in that house sir walter and elizabeth\\nwere able to rise in cordiality and do the honours of it very well\\nthey were come to bath for a few days with mrs musgrove and were\\nat the white hart  so much was pretty soon understood\\nbut till sir walter and elizabeth were walking mary into\\nthe other drawingroom and regaling themselves with her admiration\\nanne could not draw upon charless brain for a regular history\\nof their coming or an explanation of some smiling hints\\nof particular business which had been ostentatiously dropped by mary\\nas well as of some apparent confusion as to whom their party consisted of\\n\\nshe then found that it consisted of mrs musgrove henrietta\\nand captain harville beside their two selves  he gave her a very plain\\nintelligible account of the whole a narration in which she saw\\na great deal of most characteristic proceeding  the scheme\\nhad received its first impulse by captain harvilles wanting to\\ncome to bath on business  he had begun to talk of it a week ago\\nand by way of doing something as shooting was over charles had proposed\\ncoming with him and mrs harville had seemed to like the idea of it\\nvery much as an advantage to her husband but mary could not bear\\nto be left and had made herself so unhappy about it that for a day or two\\neverything seemed to be in suspense or at an end  but then\\nit had been taken up by his father and mother  his mother had\\nsome old friends in bath whom she wanted to see it was thought\\na good opportunity for henrietta to come and buy weddingclothes\\nfor herself and her sister and in short it ended in being\\nhis mothers party that everything might be comfortable and easy\\nto captain harville and he and mary were included in it\\nby way of general convenience  they had arrived late the night before\\nmrs harville her children and captain benwick remained with\\nmr musgrove and louisa at uppercross\\n\\nannes only surprise was that affairs should be in forwardness enough\\nfor henriettas weddingclothes to be talked of  she had imagined\\nsuch difficulties of fortune to exist there as must prevent\\nthe marriage from being near at hand but she learned from charles that\\nvery recently since marys last letter to herself charles hayter\\nhad been applied to by a friend to hold a living for a youth\\nwho could not possibly claim it under many years and that\\non the strength of his present income with almost a certainty\\nof something more permanent long before the term in question\\nthe two families had consented to the young peoples wishes\\nand that their marriage was likely to take place in a few months\\nquite as soon as louisas  and a very good living it was\\ncharles added  only fiveandtwenty miles from uppercross\\nand in a very fine country   fine part of dorsetshire\\nin the centre of some of the best preserves in the kingdom\\nsurrounded by three great proprietors each more careful and jealous\\nthan the other and to two of the three at least charles hayter might get\\na special recommendation  not that he will value it as he ought\\nhe observed charles is too cool about sporting thats the worst of him\\n\\ni am extremely glad indeed cried anne particularly glad\\nthat this should happen and that of two sisters who both deserve\\nequally well and who have always been such good friends\\nthe pleasant prospect of one should not be dimming those of the other\\nthat they should be so equal in their prosperity and comfort\\ni hope your father and mother are quite happy with regard to both\\n\\noh yes  my father would be well pleased if the gentlemen were richer\\nbut he has no other fault to find  money you know coming down with\\nmoneytwo daughters at onceit cannot be a very agreeable operation\\nand it streightens him as to many things  however i do not mean to say\\nthey have not a right to it  it is very fit they should have\\ndaughters shares and i am sure he has always been a very kind\\nliberal father to me  mary does not above half like henriettas match\\nshe never did you know  but she does not do him justice\\nnor think enough about winthrop  i cannot make her attend to\\nthe value of the property  it is a very fair match as times go\\nand i have liked charles hayter all my life and i shall not leave off now\\n\\nsuch excellent parents as mr and mrs musgrove exclaimed anne\\nshould be happy in their childrens marriages  they do everything\\nto confer happiness i am sure  what a blessing to young people\\nto be in such hands  your father and mother seem so totally free\\nfrom all those ambitious feelings which have led to so much misconduct\\nand misery both in young and old  i hope you think louisa\\nperfectly recovered now\\n\\nhe answered rather hesitatingly yes i believe i do very much recovered\\nbut she is altered there is no running or jumping about no laughing\\nor dancing it is quite different  if one happens only to shut the door\\na little hard she starts and wriggles like a young dabchick in the water\\nand benwick sits at her elbow reading verses or whispering to her\\nall day long\\n\\nanne could not help laughing  that cannot be much to your taste\\ni know said she but i do believe him to be an excellent young man\\n\\nto be sure he is  nobody doubts it and i hope you do not think\\ni am so illiberal as to want every man to have the same objects and\\npleasures as myself  i have a great value for benwick and when one can\\nbut get him to talk he has plenty to say  his reading has done him\\nno harm for he has fought as well as read  he is a brave fellow\\ni got more acquainted with him last monday than ever i did before\\nwe had a famous setto at rathunting all the morning in\\nmy fathers great barns and he played his part so well\\nthat i have liked him the better ever since\\n\\nhere they were interrupted by the absolute necessity of charless\\nfollowing the others to admire mirrors and china but anne had\\nheard enough to understand the present state of uppercross\\nand rejoice in its happiness and though she sighed as she rejoiced\\nher sigh had none of the illwill of envy in it  she would certainly\\nhave risen to their blessings if she could but she did not want\\nto lessen theirs\\n\\nthe visit passed off altogether in high good humour  mary was\\nin excellent spirits enjoying the gaiety and the change\\nand so well satisfied with the journey in her motherinlaws carriage\\nwith four horses and with her own complete independence of camden place\\nthat she was exactly in a temper to admire everything as she ought\\nand enter most readily into all the superiorities of the house\\nas they were detailed to her  she had no demands on her father or sister\\nand her consequence was just enough increased by their handsome\\ndrawingrooms\\n\\nelizabeth was for a short time suffering a good deal\\nshe felt that mrs musgrove and all her party ought to be asked\\nto dine with them but she could not bear to have the difference of style\\nthe reduction of servants which a dinner must betray witnessed by those\\nwho had been always so inferior to the elliots of kellynch\\nit was a struggle between propriety and vanity but vanity got the better\\nand then elizabeth was happy again  these were her internal persuasions\\nold fashioned notions country hospitality we do not profess\\nto give dinners few people in bath do lady alicia never does\\ndid not even ask her own sisters family though they were here a month\\nand i dare say it would be very inconvenient to mrs musgrove\\nput her quite out of her way  i am sure she would rather not come\\nshe cannot feel easy with us  i will ask them all for an evening\\nthat will be much better that will be a novelty and a treat\\nthey have not seen two such drawing rooms before  they will be delighted\\nto come tomorrow evening  it shall be a regular party small\\nbut most elegant  and this satisfied elizabeth  and when the invitation\\nwas given to the two present and promised for the absent\\nmary was as completely satisfied  she was particularly asked\\nto meet mr elliot and be introduced to lady dalrymple and miss carteret\\nwho were fortunately already engaged to come and she could not\\nhave received a more gratifying attention  miss elliot was to have\\nthe honour of calling on mrs musgrove in the course of the morning\\nand anne walked off with charles and mary to go and see her\\nand henrietta directly\\n\\nher plan of sitting with lady russell must give way for the present\\nthey all three called in rivers street for a couple of minutes\\nbut anne convinced herself that a days delay of the intended communication\\ncould be of no consequence and hastened forward to the white hart\\nto see again the friends and companions of the last autumn\\nwith an eagerness of goodwill which many associations contributed to form\\n\\nthey found mrs musgrove and her daughter within and by themselves\\nand anne had the kindest welcome from each  henrietta was exactly\\nin that state of recentlyimproved views of freshformed happiness\\nwhich made her full of regard and interest for everybody she had\\never liked before at all and mrs musgroves real affection had been won\\nby her usefulness when they were in distress  it was a heartiness\\nand a warmth and a sincerity which anne delighted in the more\\nfrom the sad want of such blessings at home  she was entreated\\nto give them as much of her time as possible invited for every day\\nand all day long or rather claimed as part of the family and in return\\nshe naturally fell into all her wonted ways of attention and assistance\\nand on charless leaving them together was listening to mrs musgroves\\nhistory of louisa and to henriettas of herself giving opinions\\non business and recommendations to shops with intervals of every help\\nwhich mary required from altering her ribbon to settling her accounts\\nfrom finding her keys and assorting her trinkets to trying\\nto convince her that she was not illused by anybody which mary\\nwell amused as she generally was in her station at a window\\noverlooking the entrance to the pump room could not but have\\nher moments of imagining\\n\\na morning of thorough confusion was to be expected  a large party\\nin an hotel ensured a quickchanging unsettled scene  one five minutes\\nbrought a note the next a parcel and anne had not been there\\nhalf an hour when their diningroom spacious as it was\\nseemed more than half filled  a party of steady old friends\\nwere seated around mrs musgrove and charles came back with\\ncaptains harville and wentworth  the appearance of the latter\\ncould not be more than the surprise of the moment  it was impossible\\nfor her to have forgotten to feel that this arrival of their\\ncommon friends must be soon bringing them together again\\ntheir last meeting had been most important in opening his feelings\\nshe had derived from it a delightful conviction but she feared\\nfrom his looks that the same unfortunate persuasion which had\\nhastened him away from the concert room still governed\\nhe did not seem to want to be near enough for conversation\\n\\nshe tried to be calm and leave things to take their course\\nand tried to dwell much on this argument of rational dependence\\nsurely if there be constant attachment on each side our hearts\\nmust understand each other ere long  we are not boy and girl\\nto be captiously irritable misled by every moments inadvertence\\nand wantonly playing with our own happiness  and yet\\na few minutes afterwards she felt as if their being in company\\nwith each other under their present circumstances could only be\\nexposing them to inadvertencies and misconstructions of the most\\nmischievous kind\\n\\nanne cried mary still at her window there is mrs clay\\ni am sure standing under the colonnade and a gentleman with her\\ni saw them turn the corner from bath street just now  they seemed\\ndeep in talk  who is it  come and tell me  good heavens i recollect\\nit is mr elliot himself\\n\\nno cried anne quickly it cannot be mr elliot i assure you\\nhe was to leave bath at nine this morning and does not come back\\ntill tomorrow\\n\\nas she spoke she felt that captain wentworth was looking at her\\nthe consciousness of which vexed and embarrassed her and made her regret\\nthat she had said so much simple as it was\\n\\nmary resenting that she should be supposed not to know her own cousin\\nbegan talking very warmly about the family features and protesting\\nstill more positively that it was mr elliot calling again upon anne\\nto come and look for herself but anne did not mean to stir\\nand tried to be cool and unconcerned  her distress returned\\nhowever on perceiving smiles and intelligent glances pass between\\ntwo or three of the lady visitors as if they believed themselves\\nquite in the secret  it was evident that the report concerning her\\nhad spread and a short pause succeeded which seemed to ensure\\nthat it would now spread farther\\n\\ndo come anne cried mary come and look yourself  you will be too late\\nif you do not make haste  they are parting they are shaking hands\\nhe is turning away  not know mr elliot indeed  you seem to have\\nforgot all about lyme\\n\\nto pacify mary and perhaps screen her own embarrassment\\nanne did move quietly to the window  she was just in time to ascertain\\nthat it really was mr elliot which she had never believed\\nbefore he disappeared on one side as mrs clay walked quickly off\\non the other and checking the surprise which she could not but feel\\nat such an appearance of friendly conference between two persons\\nof totally opposite interest she calmly said yes it is mr elliot\\ncertainly  he has changed his hour of going i suppose that is all\\nor i may be mistaken i might not attend and walked back to her chair\\nrecomposed and with the comfortable hope of having acquitted herself well\\n\\nthe visitors took their leave and charles having civilly seen them off\\nand then made a face at them and abused them for coming began with\\n\\nwell mother i have done something for you that you will like\\ni have been to the theatre and secured a box for tomorrow night\\nant i a good boy  i know you love a play and there is room for us all\\nit holds nine  i have engaged captain wentworth  anne will\\nnot be sorry to join us i am sure  we all like a play\\nhave not i done well mother\\n\\nmrs musgrove was good humouredly beginning to express her perfect readiness\\nfor the play if henrietta and all the others liked it when mary\\neagerly interrupted her by exclaiming\\n\\ngood heavens charles how can you think of such a thing\\ntake a box for tomorrow night  have you forgot that we are engaged\\nto camden place tomorrow night and that we were most particularly asked\\nto meet lady dalrymple and her daughter and mr elliot and all\\nthe principal family connexions on purpose to be introduced to them\\nhow can you be so forgetful\\n\\nphoo phoo replied charles whats an evening party\\nnever worth remembering  your father might have asked us to dinner\\ni think if he had wanted to see us  you may do as you like\\nbut i shall go to the play\\n\\noh charles i declare it will be too abominable if you do\\nwhen you promised to go\\n\\nno i did not promise  i only smirked and bowed and said the word\\nhappy  there was no promise\\n\\nbut you must go charles  it would be unpardonable to fail\\nwe were asked on purpose to be introduced  there was always\\nsuch a great connexion between the dalrymples and ourselves\\nnothing ever happened on either side that was not announced immediately\\nwe are quite near relations you know and mr elliot too\\nwhom you ought so particularly to be acquainted with  every attention\\nis due to mr elliot  consider my fathers heir  the future\\nrepresentative of the family\\n\\ndont talk to me about heirs and representatives cried charles\\ni am not one of those who neglect the reigning power to bow\\nto the rising sun  if i would not go for the sake of your father\\ni should think it scandalous to go for the sake of his heir\\nwhat is mr elliot to me  the careless expression was life to anne\\nwho saw that captain wentworth was all attention looking and\\nlistening with his whole soul and that the last words brought\\nhis enquiring eyes from charles to herself\\n\\ncharles and mary still talked on in the same style he half serious\\nand half jesting maintaining the scheme for the play and she\\ninvariably serious most warmly opposing it and not omitting\\nto make it known that however determined to go to camden place herself\\nshe should not think herself very well used if they went to the play\\nwithout her  mrs musgrove interposed\\n\\nwe had better put it off  charles you had much better go back\\nand change the box for tuesday  it would be a pity to be divided\\nand we should be losing miss anne too if there is a party at her fathers\\nand i am sure neither henrietta nor i should care at all for the play\\nif miss anne could not be with us\\n\\nanne felt truly obliged to her for such kindness and quite as much\\nso for the opportunity it gave her of decidedly saying\\n\\nif it depended only on my inclination maam the party at home\\nexcepting on marys account would not be the smallest impediment\\ni have no pleasure in the sort of meeting and should be too happy\\nto change it for a play and with you  but it had better\\nnot be attempted perhaps  she had spoken it but she trembled\\nwhen it was done conscious that her words were listened to\\nand daring not even to try to observe their effect\\n\\nit was soon generally agreed that tuesday should be the day\\ncharles only reserving the advantage of still teasing his wife\\nby persisting that he would go to the play tomorrow if nobody else would\\n\\ncaptain wentworth left his seat and walked to the fireplace\\nprobably for the sake of walking away from it soon afterwards\\nand taking a station with less barefaced design by anne\\n\\nyou have not been long enough in bath said he to enjoy\\nthe evening parties of the place\\n\\noh no  the usual character of them has nothing for me\\ni am no cardplayer\\n\\nyou were not formerly i know  you did not use to like cards\\nbut time makes many changes\\n\\ni am not yet so much changed cried anne and stopped fearing she\\nhardly knew what misconstruction  after waiting a few moments\\nhe said and as if it were the result of immediate feeling\\nit is a period indeed  eight years and a half is a period\\n\\nwhether he would have proceeded farther was left to annes imagination\\nto ponder over in a calmer hour for while still hearing the sounds\\nhe had uttered she was startled to other subjects by henrietta\\neager to make use of the present leisure for getting out\\nand calling on her companions to lose no time lest somebody else\\nshould come in\\n\\nthey were obliged to move  anne talked of being perfectly ready\\nand tried to look it but she felt that could henrietta have known\\nthe regret and reluctance of her heart in quitting that chair\\nin preparing to quit the room she would have found in all her own\\nsensations for her cousin in the very security of his affection\\nwherewith to pity her\\n\\ntheir preparations however were stopped short  alarming sounds\\nwere heard other visitors approached and the door was thrown open\\nfor sir walter and miss elliot whose entrance seemed to give\\na general chill  anne felt an instant oppression and wherever she looked\\nsaw symptoms of the same  the comfort the freedom the gaiety\\nof the room was over hushed into cold composure determined silence\\nor insipid talk to meet the heartless elegance of her father and sister\\nhow mortifying to feel that it was so\\n\\nher jealous eye was satisfied in one particular  captain wentworth\\nwas acknowledged again by each by elizabeth more graciously than before\\nshe even addressed him once and looked at him more than once\\nelizabeth was in fact revolving a great measure  the sequel\\nexplained it  after the waste of a few minutes in saying\\nthe proper nothings she began to give the invitation which\\nwas to comprise all the remaining dues of the musgroves\\ntomorrow evening to meet a few friends  no formal party\\nit was all said very gracefully and the cards with which she had\\nprovided herself the miss elliot at home were laid on the table\\nwith a courteous comprehensive smile to all and one smile and\\none card more decidedly for captain wentworth  the truth was\\nthat elizabeth had been long enough in bath to understand\\nthe importance of a man of such an air and appearance as his\\nthe past was nothing  the present was that captain wentworth\\nwould move about well in her drawingroom  the card was pointedly given\\nand sir walter and elizabeth arose and disappeared\\n\\nthe interruption had been short though severe and ease and animation\\nreturned to most of those they left as the door shut them out\\nbut not to anne  she could think only of the invitation she had\\nwith such astonishment witnessed and of the manner in which\\nit had been received a manner of doubtful meaning of surprise rather\\nthan gratification of polite acknowledgement rather than acceptance\\nshe knew him she saw disdain in his eye and could not venture to believe\\nthat he had determined to accept such an offering as an atonement\\nfor all the insolence of the past  her spirits sank  he held the card\\nin his hand after they were gone as if deeply considering it\\n\\nonly think of elizabeths including everybody whispered mary\\nvery audibly  i do not wonder captain wentworth is delighted\\nyou see he cannot put the card out of his hand\\n\\nanne caught his eye saw his cheeks glow and his mouth form itself\\ninto a momentary expression of contempt and turned away\\nthat she might neither see nor hear more to vex her\\n\\nthe party separated  the gentlemen had their own pursuits\\nthe ladies proceeded on their own business and they met no more while\\nanne belonged to them  she was earnestly begged to return and dine\\nand give them all the rest of the day but her spirits had been\\nso long exerted that at present she felt unequal to more\\nand fit only for home where she might be sure of being as silent\\nas she chose\\n\\npromising to be with them the whole of the following morning therefore\\nshe closed the fatigues of the present by a toilsome walk to camden place\\nthere to spend the evening chiefly in listening to the busy arrangements\\nof elizabeth and mrs clay for the morrows party the frequent enumeration\\nof the persons invited and the continually improving detail of all\\nthe embellishments which were to make it the most completely elegant\\nof its kind in bath while harassing herself with the neverending\\nquestion of whether captain wentworth would come or not  they were\\nreckoning him as certain but with her it was a gnawing solicitude\\nnever appeased for five minutes together  she generally thought\\nhe would come because she generally thought he ought but it was a case\\nwhich she could not so shape into any positive act of duty or discretion\\nas inevitably to defy the suggestions of very opposite feelings\\n\\nshe only roused herself from the broodings of this restless agitation\\nto let mrs clay know that she had been seen with mr elliot\\nthree hours after his being supposed to be out of bath\\nfor having watched in vain for some intimation of the interview\\nfrom the lady herself she determined to mention it and it seemed to her\\nthere was guilt in mrs clays face as she listened  it was transient\\ncleared away in an instant but anne could imagine she read there\\nthe consciousness of having by some complication of mutual trick\\nor some overbearing authority of his been obliged to attend\\nperhaps for half an hour to his lectures and restrictions on her designs\\non sir walter  she exclaimed however with a very tolerable\\nimitation of nature \\n\\noh dear very true  only think miss elliot to my great surprise\\ni met with mr elliot in bath street  i was never more astonished\\nhe turned back and walked with me to the pump yard  he had been prevented\\nsetting off for thornberry but i really forget by what\\nfor i was in a hurry and could not much attend and i can only answer\\nfor his being determined not to be delayed in his return\\nhe wanted to know how early he might be admitted tomorrow\\nhe was full of tomorrow and it is very evident that i have been\\nfull of it too ever since i entered the house and learnt the extension\\nof your plan and all that had happened or my seeing him could never have\\ngone so entirely out of my head\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 23\\n\\n\\none day only had passed since annes conversation with mrs smith\\nbut a keener interest had succeeded and she was now so little touched\\nby mr elliots conduct except by its effects in one quarter\\nthat it became a matter of course the next morning still to defer\\nher explanatory visit in rivers street  she had promised to be\\nwith the musgroves from breakfast to dinner  her faith was plighted\\nand mr elliots character like the sultaness scheherazades head\\nmust live another day\\n\\nshe could not keep her appointment punctually however\\nthe weather was unfavourable and she had grieved over the rain\\non her friends account and felt it very much on her own\\nbefore she was able to attempt the walk  when she reached the white hart\\nand made her way to the proper apartment she found herself\\nneither arriving quite in time nor the first to arrive\\nthe party before her were mrs musgrove talking to mrs croft\\nand captain harville to captain wentworth and she immediately heard\\nthat mary and henrietta too impatient to wait had gone out the moment\\nit had cleared but would be back again soon and that the strictest\\ninjunctions had been left with mrs musgrove to keep her there\\ntill they returned  she had only to submit sit down\\nbe outwardly composed and feel herself plunged at once\\nin all the agitations which she had merely laid her account of\\ntasting a little before the morning closed  there was no delay\\nno waste of time  she was deep in the happiness of such misery\\nor the misery of such happiness instantly  two minutes after\\nher entering the room captain wentworth said\\n\\nwe will write the letter we were talking of harville now\\nif you will give me materials\\n\\nmaterials were at hand on a separate table he went to it\\nand nearly turning his back to them all was engrossed by writing\\n\\nmrs musgrove was giving mrs croft the history of her eldest\\ndaughters engagement and just in that inconvenient tone of voice\\nwhich was perfectly audible while it pretended to be a whisper\\nanne felt that she did not belong to the conversation and yet\\nas captain harville seemed thoughtful and not disposed to talk\\nshe could not avoid hearing many undesirable particulars such as\\nhow mr musgrove and my brother hayter had met again and again\\nto talk it over what my brother hayter had said one day\\nand what mr musgrove had proposed the next and what had occurred\\nto my sister hayter and what the young people had wished and what\\ni said at first i never could consent to but was afterwards persuaded\\nto think might do very well and a great deal in the same style\\nof openhearted communication  minutiae which even with every advantage\\nof taste and delicacy which good mrs musgrove could not give\\ncould be properly interesting only to the principals  mrs croft\\nwas attending with great goodhumour and whenever she spoke at all\\nit was very sensibly  anne hoped the gentlemen might each be\\ntoo much selfoccupied to hear\\n\\nand so maam all these thing considered said mrs musgrove\\nin her powerful whisper though we could have wished it different\\nyet altogether we did not think it fair to stand out any longer\\nfor charles hayter was quite wild about it and henrietta was\\npretty near as bad and so we thought they had better marry at once\\nand make the best of it as many others have done before them\\nat any rate said i it will be better than a long engagement\\n\\nthat is precisely what i was going to observe cried mrs croft\\ni would rather have young people settle on a small income at once\\nand have to struggle with a few difficulties together than be\\ninvolved in a long engagement  i always think that no mutual\\n\\noh dear mrs croft cried mrs musgrove unable to let her\\nfinish her speech there is nothing i so abominate for young people\\nas a long engagement  it is what i always protested against\\nfor my children  it is all very well i used to say for young people\\nto be engaged if there is a certainty of their being able to marry\\nin six months or even in twelve but a long engagement\\n\\nyes dear maam said mrs croft or an uncertain engagement\\nan engagement which may be long  to begin without knowing\\nthat at such a time there will be the means of marrying\\ni hold to be very unsafe and unwise and what i think all parents\\nshould prevent as far as they can\\n\\nanne found an unexpected interest here  she felt its application\\nto herself felt it in a nervous thrill all over her and at the same\\nmoment that her eyes instinctively glanced towards the distant table\\ncaptain wentworths pen ceased to move his head was raised pausing\\nlistening and he turned round the next instant to give a look\\none quick conscious look at her\\n\\nthe two ladies continued to talk to reurge the same admitted truths\\nand enforce them with such examples of the ill effect of\\na contrary practice as had fallen within their observation\\nbut anne heard nothing distinctly it was only a buzz of words in her ear\\nher mind was in confusion\\n\\ncaptain harville who had in truth been hearing none of it\\nnow left his seat and moved to a window and anne seeming to watch him\\nthough it was from thorough absence of mind became gradually sensible\\nthat he was inviting her to join him where he stood  he looked at her\\nwith a smile and a little motion of the head which expressed\\ncome to me i have something to say and the unaffected\\neasy kindness of manner which denoted the feelings of an older acquaintance\\nthan he really was strongly enforced the invitation  she roused herself\\nand went to him  the window at which he stood was at the other end\\nof the room from where the two ladies were sitting and though nearer\\nto captain wentworths table not very near  as she joined him\\ncaptain harvilles countenance reassumed the serious thoughtful\\nexpression which seemed its natural character\\n\\nlook here said he unfolding a parcel in his hand and displaying\\na small miniature painting do you know who that is\\n\\ncertainly  captain benwick\\n\\nyes and you may guess who it is for  but in a deep tone\\nit was not done for her  miss elliot do you remember our\\nwalking together at lyme and grieving for him  i little thought then\\nbut no matter  this was drawn at the cape  he met with\\na clever young german artist at the cape and in compliance with a promise\\nto my poor sister sat to him and was bringing it home for her\\nand i have now the charge of getting it properly set for another\\nit was a commission to me  but who else was there to employ\\ni hope i can allow for him  i am not sorry indeed to make it\\nover to another  he undertakes it looking towards captain wentworth\\nhe is writing about it now  and with a quivering lip he wound up\\nthe whole by adding poor fanny she would not have forgotten him so soon\\n\\nno replied anne in a low feeling voice that i can easily believe\\n\\nit was not in her nature  she doted on him\\n\\nit would not be the nature of any woman who truly loved\\n\\ncaptain harville smiled as much as to say do you claim that\\nfor your sex and she answered the question smiling also\\nyes  we certainly do not forget you as soon as you forget us\\nit is perhaps our fate rather than our merit  we cannot help ourselves\\nwe live at home quiet confined and our feelings prey upon us\\nyou are forced on exertion  you have always a profession pursuits\\nbusiness of some sort or other to take you back into the world immediately\\nand continual occupation and change soon weaken impressions\\n\\ngranting your assertion that the world does all this so soon for men\\nwhich however i do not think i shall grant it does not apply\\nto benwick  he has not been forced upon any exertion  the peace\\nturned him on shore at the very moment and he has been living with us\\nin our little family circle ever since\\n\\ntrue said anne very true i did not recollect but what shall\\nwe say now captain harville  if the change be not from\\noutward circumstances it must be from within it must be nature\\nmans nature which has done the business for captain benwick\\n\\nno no it is not mans nature  i will not allow it to be more\\nmans nature than womans to be inconstant and forget those they do love\\nor have loved  i believe the reverse  i believe in a true analogy\\nbetween our bodily frames and our mental and that as our bodies are\\nthe strongest so are our feelings capable of bearing most rough usage\\nand riding out the heaviest weather\\n\\nyour feelings may be the strongest replied anne but the same spirit\\nof analogy will authorise me to assert that ours are the most tender\\nman is more robust than woman but he is not longer lived\\nwhich exactly explains my view of the nature of their attachments\\nnay it would be too hard upon you if it were otherwise\\nyou have difficulties and privations and dangers enough to struggle with\\nyou are always labouring and toiling exposed to every risk and hardship\\nyour home country friends all quitted  neither time nor health\\nnor life to be called your own  it would be hard indeed\\nwith a faltering voice if womans feelings were to be\\nadded to all this\\n\\nwe shall never agree upon this question captain harville\\nwas beginning to say when a slight noise called their attention\\nto captain wentworths hitherto perfectly quiet division of the room\\nit was nothing more than that his pen had fallen down but anne was\\nstartled at finding him nearer than she had supposed and half inclined\\nto suspect that the pen had only fallen because he had been\\noccupied by them striving to catch sounds which yet she did not think\\nhe could have caught\\n\\nhave you finished your letter said captain harville\\n\\nnot quite a few lines more  i shall have done in five minutes\\n\\nthere is no hurry on my side  i am only ready whenever you are\\ni am in very good anchorage here smiling at anne well supplied\\nand want for nothing  no hurry for a signal at all  well miss elliot\\nlowering his voice as i was saying we shall never agree\\ni suppose upon this point  no man and woman would probably\\nbut let me observe that all histories are against youall stories\\nprose and verse  if i had such a memory as benwick i could bring you\\nfifty quotations in a moment on my side the argument and i do not think\\ni ever opened a book in my life which had not something to say\\nupon womans inconstancy  songs and proverbs all talk\\nof womans fickleness  but perhaps you will say these were all\\nwritten by men\\n\\nperhaps i shall  yes yes if you please no reference to examples\\nin books  men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story\\neducation has been theirs in so much higher a degree the pen has\\nbeen in their hands  i will not allow books to prove anything\\n\\nbut how shall we prove anything\\n\\nwe never shall  we never can expect to prove any thing upon such a point\\nit is a difference of opinion which does not admit of proof\\nwe each begin probably with a little bias towards our own sex\\nand upon that bias build every circumstance in favour of it\\nwhich has occurred within our own circle many of which circumstances\\nperhaps those very cases which strike us the most may be precisely such\\nas cannot be brought forward without betraying a confidence\\nor in some respect saying what should not be said\\n\\nah cried captain harville in a tone of strong feeling\\nif i could but make you comprehend what a man suffers when he takes\\na last look at his wife and children and watches the boat\\nthat he has sent them off in as long as it is in sight\\nand then turns away and says god knows whether we ever meet again\\nand then if i could convey to you the glow of his soul when he does\\nsee them again when coming back after a twelvemonths absence\\nperhaps and obliged to put into another port he calculates how soon\\nit be possible to get them there pretending to deceive himself\\nand saying they cannot be here till such a day but all the while\\nhoping for them twelve hours sooner and seeing them arrive at last\\nas if heaven had given them wings by many hours sooner still\\nif i could explain to you all this and all that a man can bear and do\\nand glories to do for the sake of these treasures of his existence\\ni speak you know only of such men as have hearts pressing his own\\nwith emotion\\n\\noh cried anne eagerly i hope i do justice to all that is felt by you\\nand by those who resemble you  god forbid that i should undervalue\\nthe warm and faithful feelings of any of my fellowcreatures\\ni should deserve utter contempt if i dared to suppose that true attachment\\nand constancy were known only by woman  no i believe you capable\\nof everything great and good in your married lives  i believe you equal\\nto every important exertion and to every domestic forbearance\\nso long asif i may be allowed the expressionso long as you have\\nan object  i mean while the woman you love lives and lives for you\\nall the privilege i claim for my own sex it is not a very enviable one\\nyou need not covet it is that of loving longest when existence\\nor when hope is gone\\n\\nshe could not immediately have uttered another sentence her heart\\nwas too full her breath too much oppressed\\n\\nyou are a good soul cried captain harville putting his hand\\non her arm quite affectionately  there is no quarrelling with you\\nand when i think of benwick my tongue is tied\\n\\ntheir attention was called towards the others  mrs croft was taking leave\\n\\nhere frederick you and i part company i believe said she\\ni am going home and you have an engagement with your friend\\ntonight we may have the pleasure of all meeting again at your party\\nturning to anne  we had your sisters card yesterday\\nand i understood frederick had a card too though i did not see it\\nand you are disengaged frederick are you not as well as ourselves\\n\\ncaptain wentworth was folding up a letter in great haste and either\\ncould not or would not answer fully\\n\\nyes said he very true here we separate but harville and i\\nshall soon be after you that is harville if you are ready\\ni am in half a minute  i know you will not be sorry to be off\\ni shall be at your service in half a minute\\n\\nmrs croft left them and captain wentworth having sealed his letter\\nwith great rapidity was indeed ready and had even a hurried\\nagitated air which shewed impatience to be gone  anne knew not how\\nto understand it  she had the kindest good morning god bless you\\nfrom captain harville but from him not a word nor a look\\nhe had passed out of the room without a look\\n\\nshe had only time however to move closer to the table where\\nhe had been writing when footsteps were heard returning\\nthe door opened it was himself  he begged their pardon\\nbut he had forgotten his gloves and instantly crossing the room\\nto the writing table he drew out a letter from under the scattered paper\\nplaced it before anne with eyes of glowing entreaty fixed on her\\nfor a time and hastily collecting his gloves was again out of the room\\nalmost before mrs musgrove was aware of his being in it\\nthe work of an instant\\n\\nthe revolution which one instant had made in anne was almost\\nbeyond expression  the letter with a direction hardly legible\\nto miss a e was evidently the one which he had been folding\\nso hastily  while supposed to be writing only to captain benwick\\nhe had been also addressing her  on the contents of that letter\\ndepended all which this world could do for her  anything was possible\\nanything might be defied rather than suspense  mrs musgrove had\\nlittle arrangements of her own at her own table to their protection\\nshe must trust and sinking into the chair which he had occupied\\nsucceeding to the very spot where he had leaned and written\\nher eyes devoured the following words\\n\\n\\ni can listen no longer in silence  i must speak to you by such means\\nas are within my reach  you pierce my soul  i am half agony\\nhalf hope  tell me not that i am too late that such precious feelings\\nare gone for ever  i offer myself to you again with a heart\\neven more your own than when you almost broke it eight years\\nand a half ago  dare not say that man forgets sooner than  woman\\nthat his love has an earlier death  i have loved none but you\\nunjust i may have been weak and resentful i have been\\nbut never inconstant  you alone have brought me to bath\\nfor you alone i think and plan  have you not seen this\\ncan you fail to have understood my wishes  i had not waited even\\nthese ten days could i have

that voice when they would be lost on others\\ntoo good too excellent creature  you do us justice indeed\\nyou do believe that there is true attachment and constancy among men\\nbelieve it to be most

fathers house\\nthis evening or never\\n\\n\\nsuch a letter was not to be soon recovered from  half and hours solitude\\nand reflection might have tranquillized her but the ten minutes only\\nwhich now passed before she was interrupted with all the restraints\\nof her situation could do nothing towards tranquillity  every moment\\nrather brought fresh agitation  it was overpowering happiness\\nand before she was beyond the first stage of full sensation\\ncharles mary and henrietta all came in\\n\\nthe absolute necessity of seeming like herself produced then\\nan immediate struggle but after a while she could do no more\\nshe began not to understand a word they said and was obliged\\nto plead indisposition and excuse herself  they could then see\\nthat she looked very ill were shocked and concerned and would not\\nstir without her for the world  this was dreadful  would they only\\nhave gone away and left her in the quiet possession of that room\\nit would have been her cure but to have them all standing or\\nwaiting around her was distracting and in desperation\\nshe said she would go home\\n\\nby all means my dear cried mrs musgrove go home directly\\nand take care of yourself that you may be fit for the evening\\ni wish sarah was here to doctor you but i am no doctor myself\\ncharles ring and order a chair  she must not walk\\n\\nbut the chair would never do  worse than all  to lose the possibility\\nof speaking two words to captain wentworth in the course of her quiet\\nsolitary progress up the town and she felt almost certain of meeting him\\ncould not be borne  the chair was earnestly protested against\\nand mrs musgrove who thought only of one sort of illness\\nhaving assured herself with some anxiety that there had been no fall\\nin the case that anne had not at any time lately slipped down\\nand got a blow on her head that she was perfectly convinced of having\\nhad no fall could part with her cheerfully and depend on\\nfinding her better at night\\n\\nanxious to omit no possible precaution anne struggled and said\\n\\ni am afraid maam that it is not perfectly understood\\npray be so good as to mention to the other gentlemen that we hope\\nto see your whole party this evening  i am afraid there had been\\nsome mistake and i wish you particularly to assure captain harville\\nand captain wentworth that we hope to see them both\\n\\noh my dear it is quite understood i give you my word\\ncaptain harville has no thought but of going\\n\\ndo you think so  but i am afraid and i should be so very sorry\\nwill you promise me to mention it when you see them again\\nyou will see them both this morning i dare say  do promise me\\n\\nto be sure i will if you wish it  charles if you see captain harville\\nanywhere remember to give miss annes message  but indeed my dear\\nyou need not be uneasy  captain harville holds himself quite engaged\\nill answer for it and captain wentworth the same i dare say\\n\\nanne could do no more but her heart prophesied some mischance\\nto damp the perfection of her felicity  it could not be very lasting\\nhowever  even if he did not come to camden place himself\\nit would be in her power to send an intelligible sentence\\nby captain harville  another momentary vexation occurred\\ncharles in his real concern and good nature would go home with her\\nthere was no preventing him  this was almost cruel  but she could not\\nbe long ungrateful he was sacrificing an engagement at a gunsmiths\\nto be of use to her and she set off with him with no feeling\\nbut gratitude apparent\\n\\nthey were on union street when a quicker step behind a something\\nof familiar sound gave her two moments preparation for the sight\\nof captain wentworth  he joined them but as if irresolute\\nwhether to join or to pass on said nothing only looked\\nanne could command herself enough to receive that look\\nand not repulsively  the cheeks which had been pale now glowed\\nand the movements which had hesitated were decided  he walked by her side\\npresently struck by a sudden thought charles said\\n\\ncaptain wentworth which way are you going  only to gay street\\nor farther up the town\\n\\ni hardly know replied captain wentworth surprised\\n\\nare you going as high as belmont  are you going near camden place\\nbecause if you are i shall have no scruple in asking you\\nto take my place and give anne your arm to her fathers door\\nshe is rather done for this morning and must not go so far without help\\nand i ought to be at that fellows in the market place\\nhe promised me the sight of a capital gun he is just going to send off\\nsaid he would keep it unpacked to the last possible moment\\nthat i might see it and if i do not turn back now i have no chance\\nby his description a good deal like the second size doublebarrel of mine\\nwhich you shot with one day round winthrop\\n\\nthere could not be an objection  there could be only the most\\nproper alacrity a most obliging compliance for public view\\nand smiles reined in and spirits dancing in private rapture\\nin half a minute charles was at the bottom of union street again\\nand the other two proceeding together  and soon words enough had passed\\nbetween them to decide their direction towards the comparatively quiet\\nand retired gravel walk where the power of conversation would make\\nthe present hour a blessing indeed and prepare it for all\\nthe immortality which the happiest recollections of their own future lives\\ncould bestow  there they exchanged again those feelings\\nand those promises which had once before seemed to secure everything\\nbut which had been followed by so many many years of division\\nand estrangement  there they returned again into the past\\nmore exquisitely happy perhaps in their reunion than when\\nit had been first projected more tender more tried more fixed\\nin a knowledge of each others character truth and attachment\\nmore equal to act more justified in acting  and there as they slowly\\npaced the gradual ascent heedless of every group around them\\nseeing neither sauntering politicians bustling housekeepers\\nflirting girls nor nurserymaids and children they could indulge in\\nthose retrospections and acknowledgements and especially in\\nthose explanations of what had directly preceded the present moment\\nwhich were so poignant and so ceaseless in interest  all the little\\nvariations of the last week were gone through and of yesterday\\nand today there could scarcely be an end\\n\\nshe had not mistaken him  jealousy of mr elliot had been\\nthe retarding weight the doubt the torment  that had begun to operate\\nin the very hour of first meeting her in bath that had returned\\nafter a short suspension to ruin the concert and that had influenced him\\nin everything he had said and done or omitted to say and do\\nin the last fourandtwenty hours  it had been gradually yielding\\nto the better hopes which her looks or words or actions\\noccasionally encouraged it had been vanquished at last by\\nthose sentiments and those tones which had reached him while she talked\\nwith captain harville and under the irresistible governance of which\\nhe had seized a sheet of paper and poured out his feelings\\n\\nof what he had then written nothing was to be retracted or qualified\\nhe persisted in having loved none but her  she had never been supplanted\\nhe never even believed himself to see her equal  thus much indeed\\nhe was obliged to acknowledge  that he had been constant unconsciously\\nnay unintentionally that he had meant to forget her and believed it\\nto be done  he had imagined himself indifferent when he had only\\nbeen angry and he had been unjust to her merits because he had been\\na sufferer from them  her character was now fixed on his mind\\nas perfection itself maintaining the loveliest medium of fortitude\\nand gentleness but he was obliged to acknowledge that only at uppercross\\nhad he learnt to do her justice and only at lyme had he begun\\nto understand himself  at lyme he had received lessons\\nof more than one sort  the passing admiration of mr elliot\\nhad at least roused him and the scenes on the cobb and at\\ncaptain harvilles had fixed her superiority\\n\\nin his preceding attempts to attach himself to louisa musgrove\\nthe attempts of angry pride he protested that he had for ever\\nfelt it to be impossible that he had not cared could not care\\nfor louisa though till that day till the leisure for reflection\\nwhich followed it he had not understood the perfect excellence\\nof the mind with which louisas could so ill bear a comparison\\nor the perfect unrivalled hold it possessed over his own\\nthere he had learnt to distinguish between the steadiness of principle\\nand the obstinacy of selfwill between the darings of heedlessness\\nand the resolution of a collected mind  there he had seen everything\\nto exalt in his estimation the woman he had lost and there begun\\nto deplore the pride the folly the madness of resentment\\nwhich had kept him from trying to regain her when thrown in his way\\n\\nfrom that period his penance had become severe  he had no sooner\\nbeen free from the horror and remorse attending the first few days\\nof louisas accident no sooner begun to feel himself alive again\\nthan he had begun to feel himself though alive not at liberty\\n\\ni found said he that i was considered by harville an engaged man\\nthat neither harville nor his wife entertained a doubt of our\\nmutual attachment  i was startled and shocked  to a degree\\ni could contradict this instantly but when i began to reflect\\nthat others might have felt the sameher own family nay\\nperhaps herselfi was no longer at my own disposal  i was hers in honour\\nif she wished it  i had been unguarded  i had not thought seriously\\non this subject before  i had not considered that my excessive intimacy\\nmust have its danger of ill consequence in many ways and that i had\\nno right to be trying whether i could attach myself to either of the girls\\nat the risk of raising even an unpleasant report were there no other\\nill effects  i had been grossly wrong and must abide the consequences\\n\\nhe found too late in short that he had entangled himself\\nand that precisely as he became fully satisfied of his not caring\\nfor louisa at all he must regard himself as bound to her\\nif her sentiments for him were what the harvilles supposed\\nit determined him to leave lyme and await her complete recovery elsewhere\\nhe would gladly weaken by any fair means whatever feelings or\\nspeculations concerning him might exist and he went therefore\\nto his brothers meaning after a while to return to kellynch\\nand act as circumstances might require\\n\\ni was six weeks with edward said he and saw him happy\\ni could have no other pleasure  i deserved none  he enquired after you\\nvery particularly asked even if you were personally altered\\nlittle suspecting that to my eye you could never alter\\n\\nanne smiled and let it pass  it was too pleasing a blunder\\nfor a reproach  it is something for a woman to be assured\\nin her eightandtwentieth year that she has not lost one charm\\nof earlier youth but the value of such homage was inexpressibly increased\\nto anne by comparing it with former words and feeling it to be\\nthe result not the cause of a revival of his warm attachment\\n\\nhe had remained in shropshire lamenting the blindness of his own pride\\nand the blunders of his own calculations till at once released from louisa\\nby the astonishing and felicitous intelligence of her engagement\\nwith benwick\\n\\nhere said he ended the worst of my state for now i could at least\\nput myself in the way of happiness i could exert myself\\ni could do something  but to be waiting so long in inaction\\nand waiting only for evil had been dreadful  within the first\\nfive minutes i said i will be at bath on wednesday and i was\\nwas it unpardonable to think it worth my while to come and to arrive\\nwith some degree of hope  you were single  it was possible that\\nyou might retain the feelings of the past as i did and one encouragement\\nhappened to be mine  i could never doubt that you would be loved and\\nsought by others but i knew to a certainty that you had refused one man\\nat least of better pretensions than myself and i could not help\\noften saying was this for me\\n\\ntheir first meeting in milsom street afforded much to be said\\nbut the concert still more  that evening seemed to be made up\\nof exquisite moments  the moment of her stepping forward\\nin the octagon room to speak to him  the moment of mr elliots appearing\\nand tearing her away and one or two subsequent moments\\nmarked by returning hope or increasing despondency were dwelt on\\nwith energy\\n\\nto see you cried he in the midst of those who could not be\\nmy wellwishers to see your cousin close by you conversing and smiling\\nand feel all the horrible eligibilities and proprieties of the match\\nto consider it as the certain wish of every being who could hope\\nto influence you  even if your own feelings were reluctant or indifferent\\nto consider what powerful supports would be his  was it not enough\\nto make the fool of me which i appeared  how could i look on\\nwithout agony  was not the very sight of the friend who sat behind you\\nwas not the recollection of what had been the knowledge of her influence\\nthe indelible immoveable impression of what persuasion had once done\\nwas it not all against me\\n\\nyou should have distinguished replied anne  you should not have\\nsuspected me now the case is so different and my age is so different\\nif i was wrong in yielding to persuasion once remember that\\nit was to persuasion exerted on the side of safety not of risk\\nwhen i yielded i thought it was to duty but no duty could be called\\nin aid here  in marrying a man indifferent to me all risk\\nwould have been incurred and all duty violated\\n\\nperhaps i ought to have reasoned thus he replied but i could not\\ni could not derive benefit from the late knowledge i had acquired\\nof your character  i could not bring it into play it was overwhelmed\\nburied lost in those earlier feelings which i had been smarting under\\nyear after year  i could think of you only as one who had yielded\\nwho had given me up who had been influenced by any one rather than by me\\ni saw you with the very person who had guided you in that year of misery\\ni had no reason to believe her of less authority now  the force of habit\\nwas to be added\\n\\ni should have thought said anne that my manner to yourself\\nmight have spared you much or all of this\\n\\nno no your manner might be only the ease which your engagement\\nto another man would give  i left you in this belief and yet\\ni was determined to see you again  my spirits rallied with the morning\\nand i felt that i had still a motive for remaining here\\n\\nat last anne was at home again and happier than any one in that house\\ncould have conceived  all the surprise and suspense and every other\\npainful part of the morning dissipated by this conversation\\nshe reentered the house so happy as to be obliged to find an alloy\\nin some momentary apprehensions of its being impossible to last\\nan interval of meditation serious and grateful was the best corrective\\nof everything dangerous in such highwrought felicity and she went\\nto her room and grew steadfast and fearless in the thankfulness\\nof her enjoyment\\n\\nthe evening came the drawingrooms were lighted up the company assembled\\nit was but a card party it was but a mixture of those who had\\nnever met before and those who met too often a commonplace business\\ntoo numerous for intimacy too small for variety but anne had never found\\nan evening shorter  glowing and lovely in sensibility and happiness\\nand more generally admired than she thought about or cared for\\nshe had cheerful or forbearing feelings for every creature around her\\nmr elliot was there she avoided but she could pity him\\nthe wallises she had amusement in understanding them  lady dalrymple\\nand miss carteretthey would soon be innoxious cousins to her\\nshe cared not for mrs clay and had nothing to blush for in\\nthe public manners of her father and sister  with the musgroves\\nthere was the happy chat of perfect ease with captain harville\\nthe kindhearted intercourse of brother and sister with lady russell\\nattempts at conversation which a delicious consciousness cut short\\nwith admiral and mrs croft everything of peculiar cordiality and\\nfervent interest which the same consciousness sought to conceal\\nand with captain wentworth some moments of communications\\ncontinually occurring and always the hope of more and always\\nthe knowledge of his being there\\n\\nit was in one of these short meetings each apparently occupied\\nin admiring a fine display of greenhouse plants that she said\\n\\ni have been thinking over the past and trying impartially\\nto judge of the right and wrong i mean with regard to myself\\nand i must believe that i was right much as i suffered from it\\nthat i was perfectly right in being guided by the friend whom\\nyou will love better than you do now  to me she was in the place\\nof a parent  do not mistake me however  i am not saying\\nthat she did not err in her advice  it was perhaps one of those cases\\nin which advice is good or bad only as the event decides\\nand for myself i certainly never should in any circumstance\\nof tolerable similarity give such advice  but i mean that i was right\\nin submitting to her and that if i had done otherwise i should have\\nsuffered more in continuing the engagement than i did even in giving it up\\nbecause i should have suffered in my conscience  i have now\\nas far as such a sentiment is allowable in human nature nothing\\nto reproach myself with and if i mistake not a strong sense of duty\\nis no bad part of a womans portion\\n\\nhe looked at her looked at lady russell and looking again at her\\nreplied as if in cool deliberation\\n\\nnot yet  but there are hopes of her being forgiven in time\\ni trust to being in charity with her soon  but i too have been\\nthinking over the past and a  question has suggested itself\\nwhether there may not have been one person more my enemy\\neven than that lady  my own self  tell me if when i returned\\nto england in the year eight with a few thousand pounds\\nand was posted into the laconia if i had then written to you\\nwould you have answered my letter  would you in short\\nhave renewed the engagement then\\n\\nwould i was all her answer but the accent was decisive enough\\n\\ngood god he cried you would  it is not that i did not think of it\\nor desire it as what could alone crown all my other success\\nbut i was proud too proud to ask again  i did not understand you\\ni shut my eyes and would not understand you or do you justice\\nthis is a recollection which ought to make me forgive every one\\nsooner than myself  six years of separation and suffering\\nmight have been spared  it is a sort of pain too which is new to me\\ni have been used to the gratification of believing myself to earn\\nevery blessing that i enjoyed  i have valued myself on honourable toils\\nand just rewards  like other great men under reverses he added\\nwith a smile i must endeavour to subdue my mind to my fortune\\ni must learn to brook being happier than i deserve\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 24\\n\\n\\nwho can be in doubt of what followed  when any two young people\\ntake it into their heads to marry they are pretty sure by perseverance\\nto carry their point be they ever so poor or ever so imprudent\\nor ever so little likely to be necessary to each others ultimate comfort\\nthis may be bad morality to conclude with but i believe it to be truth\\nand if such parties succeed how should a captain wentworth and\\nan anne elliot with the advantage of maturity of mind\\nconsciousness of right and one independent fortune between them\\nfail of bearing down every opposition  they might in fact\\nhave borne down a great deal more than they met with for there was\\nlittle to distress them beyond the want of graciousness and warmth\\nsir walter made no objection and elizabeth did nothing worse\\nthan look cold and unconcerned  captain wentworth with fiveandtwenty\\nthousand pounds and as high in his profession as merit and activity\\ncould place him was no longer nobody  he was now esteemed quite worthy\\nto address the daughter of a foolish spendthrift baronet\\nwho had not had principle or sense enough to maintain himself\\nin the situation in which providence had placed him and who could\\ngive his daughter at present but a small part of the share\\nof ten thousand pounds which must be hers hereafter\\n\\nsir walter indeed though he had no affection for anne\\nand no vanity flattered to make him really happy on the occasion\\nwas very far from thinking it a bad match for her  on the contrary\\nwhen he saw more of captain wentworth saw him repeatedly by daylight\\nand eyed him well he was very much struck by his personal claims\\nand felt that his superiority of appearance might be not unfairly balanced\\nagainst her superiority of rank and all this assisted by\\nhis wellsounding name enabled sir walter at last to prepare his pen\\nwith a very good grace for the insertion of the marriage\\nin the volume of honour\\n\\nthe only one among them whose opposition of feeling could excite\\nany serious anxiety was lady russell  anne knew that lady russell\\nmust be suffering some pain in understanding and relinquishing mr elliot\\nand be making some struggles to become truly acquainted with\\nand do justice to captain wentworth  this however was what\\nlady russell had now to do  she must learn to feel that she had\\nbeen mistaken with regard to both that she had been unfairly influenced\\nby appearances in each that because captain wentworths manners\\nhad not suited her own ideas she had been too quick in suspecting them\\nto indicate a character of dangerous impetuosity and that because\\nmr elliots manners had precisely pleased her in their propriety\\nand correctness their general politeness and suavity she had been\\ntoo quick in receiving them as the certain result of the most correct\\nopinions and wellregulated mind  there was nothing less\\nfor lady russell to do than to admit that she had been\\npretty completely wrong and to take up a new set of opinions\\nand of hopes\\n\\nthere is a quickness of perception in some a nicety in the discernment\\nof character a natural penetration in short which no experience\\nin others can equal and lady russell had been less gifted\\nin this part of understanding than her young friend  but she was\\na very good woman and if her second object was to be sensible\\nand welljudging her first was to see anne happy  she loved anne\\nbetter than she loved her own abilities and when the awkwardness\\nof the beginning was over found little hardship in attaching herself\\nas a mother to the man who was securing the happiness of her other child\\n\\nof all the family mary was probably the one most immediately gratified\\nby the circumstance  it was creditable to have a sister married\\nand she might flatter herself with having been greatly instrumental\\nto the connexion by keeping anne with her in the autumn\\nand as her own sister must be better than her husbands sisters\\nit was very agreeable that captain wentworth should be a richer man than\\neither captain benwick or charles hayter  she had something to suffer\\nperhaps when they came into contact again in seeing anne restored\\nto the rights of seniority and the mistress of a very pretty landaulette\\nbut she had a future to look forward to of powerful consolation\\nanne had no uppercross hall before her no landed estate\\nno headship of a family and if they could but keep captain wentworth\\nfrom being made a baronet she would not change situations with anne\\n\\nit would be well for the eldest sister if she were equally satisfied\\nwith her situation for a change is not very probable there\\nshe had soon the mortification of seeing mr elliot withdraw\\nand no one of proper condition has since presented himself to raise\\neven the unfounded hopes which sunk with him\\n\\nthe news of his cousins annes engagement burst on mr elliot\\nmost unexpectedly  it deranged his best plan of domestic happiness\\nhis best hope of keeping sir walter single by the watchfulness\\nwhich a soninlaws rights would have given  but though discomfited\\nand disappointed he could still do something for his own interest\\nand his own enjoyment  he soon quitted bath and on mrs clays\\nquitting it soon afterwards and being next heard of as established\\nunder his protection in london it was evident how double a game\\nhe had been playing and how determined he was to save himself\\nfrom being cut out by one artful woman at least\\n\\nmrs clays affections had overpowered her interest and she had sacrificed\\nfor the young mans sake the possibility of scheming longer\\nfor sir walter  she has abilities however as well as affections\\nand it is now a doubtful point whether his cunning or hers\\nmay finally carry the day whether after preventing her from being\\nthe wife of sir walter he may not be wheedled and caressed at last\\ninto making her the wife of sir william\\n\\nit cannot be doubted that sir walter and elizabeth were shocked\\nand mortified by the loss of their companion and the discovery of\\ntheir deception in her  they had their great cousins to be sure\\nto resort to for comfort but they must long feel that to flatter\\nand
