there his faculties were roused into admiration and\\nrespect, by contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patents;\\nthere any unwelcome sensations, arising from domestic affairs\\nchanged naturally into pity and contempt as he turned over\\nthe almost endless creations of the last century; and there,\\nif every other leaf were powerless, he could read his own history\\nwith an interest which never failed.  this was the page at which\\nthe favourite volume always opened:\\n\\n           \"elliot of kellynch hall.\\n\\n\"walter elliot, born march 1, 1760, married, july 15, 1784, elizabeth,\\ndaughter of james stevenson, esq. of south park, in the county of\\ngloucester, by which lady (who died 1800) he has issue elizabeth,\\nborn june 1, 1785; anne, born august 9, 1787; a still-born son,\\nnovember 5, 1789; mary, born november 20, 1791.\"\\n\\nprecisely such had the paragraph originally stood from the printer\\'s hands;\\nbut sir walter had improved it by adding, for the information of\\nhimself and his family, these words, after the date of mary\\'s birth--\\n\"married, december 16, 1810, charles, son and heir of charles\\nmusgrove, esq. of uppercross, in the county of somerset,\"\\nand by inserting most accurately the day of the month on which\\nhe had lost his wife.\\n\\nthen followed the history and rise of the ancient and respectable family,\\nin the usual terms; how it had been first settled in cheshire;\\nhow mentioned in dugdale, serving the office of high sheriff,\\nrepresenting a borough in three successive parliaments,\\nexertions of loyalty, and dignity of baronet, in the first year\\nof charles ii, with all the marys and elizabeths they had married;\\nforming altogether two handsome duodecimo pages, and concluding with\\nthe arms and motto:--\"principal seat, kellynch hall, in the county\\nof somerset,\" and sir walter\\'s handwriting again in this finale:--\\n\\n\"heir presumptive, william walter elliot, esq., great grandson of\\nthe second sir walter.\"\\n\\nvanity was the beginning and the end of sir walter elliot\\'s character;\\nvanity of person and of situation.  he had been remarkably handsome\\nin his youth; and, at fifty-four, was still a very fine man.\\nfew women could think more of their personal appearance than he did,\\nnor could the valet of any new made lord be more delighted with\\nthe place he held in society.  he considered the blessing of beauty\\nas inferior only to the blessing of a baronetcy; and the sir walter elliot,\\nwho united these gifts, was the constant object of his warmest respect\\nand devotion.\\n\\nhis good looks and his rank had one fair claim on his attachment;\\nsince to them he must have owed a wife of very superior character\\nto any thing deserved by his own.  lady elliot had been an excellent woman,\\nsensible and amiable; whose judgement and conduct, if they might be\\npardoned the youthful infatuation which made her lady elliot,\\nhad never required indulgence afterwards.--she had humoured,\\nor softened, or concealed his failings, and promoted his real\\nrespectability for seventeen years; and though not the very happiest\\nbeing in the world herself, had found enough in her duties, her friends,\\nand her children, to attach her to life, and make it no matter of\\nindifference to her when she was called on to quit them.\\n--three girls, the two eldest sixteen and fourteen, was an awful legacy\\nfor a mother to bequeath, an awful charge rather, to confide to\\nthe authority and guidance of a conceited, silly father.\\nshe had, however, one very intimate friend, a sensible, deserving woman,\\nwho had been brought, by strong attachment to herself, to settle\\nclose by her, in the village of kellynch; and on her kindness and advice,\\nlady elliot mainly relied for the best help and maintenance of\\nthe good principles and instruction which she had been anxiously\\ngiving her daughters.\\n\\nthis friend, and sir walter, did not marry, whatever might have been\\nanticipated on that head by their acquaintance.  thirteen years\\nhad passed away since lady elliot\\'s death, and they were still\\nnear neighbours and intimate friends, and one remained a widower,\\nthe other a widow.\\n\\nthat lady russell, of steady age and character, and extremely\\nwell provided for, should have no thought of a second marriage,\\nneeds no apology to the public, which is rather apt to be unreasonably\\ndiscontented when a woman does marry again, than when she does not;\\nbut sir walter\\'s continuing in singleness requires explanation.\\nbe it known then, that sir walter, like a good father, (having met with\\none or two private disappointments in very unreasonable applications),\\nprided himself on remaining single for his dear daughters\\' sake.\\nfor one daughter, his eldest, he would really have given up any thing,\\nwhich he had not been very much tempted to do.  elizabeth had succeeded,\\nat sixteen, to all that was possible, of her mother\\'s rights\\nand consequence; and being very handsome, and very like himself,\\nher influence had always been great, and they had gone on together\\nmost happily.  his two other children were of very inferior value.\\nmary had acquired a little artificial importance, by becoming\\nmrs charles musgrove; but anne, with an elegance of mind and sweetness\\nof character, which must have placed her high with any people\\nof real understanding, was nobody with either father or sister;\\nher word had no weight, her convenience was always to give way--\\nshe was only anne.\\n\\nto lady russell, indeed, she was a most dear and highly valued\\ngod-daughter, favourite, and friend.  lady russell loved them all;\\nbut it was only in anne that she could fancy the mother to revive again.\\n\\na few years before, anne elliot had been a very pretty girl,\\nbut her bloom had vanished early; and as even in its height,\\nher father had found little to admire in her, (so totally different\\nwere her delicate features and mild dark eyes from his own),\\nthere could be nothing in them, now that she was faded and thin,\\nto excite his esteem. he had never indulged much hope, he had now none,\\nof ever reading her name in any other page of his favourite work.\\nall equality of alliance must rest with elizabeth, for mary had merely\\nconnected herself with an old country family of respectability and\\nlarge fortune, and had therefore given all the honour and received none:\\nelizabeth would, one day or other, marry suitably.\\n\\nit sometimes happens that a woman is handsomer at twenty-nine than\\nshe was ten years before; and, generally speaking, if there has been\\nneither ill health nor anxiety, it is a time of life at which scarcely any\\ncharm is lost.  it was so with elizabeth, still the same handsome\\nmiss elliot that she had begun to be thirteen years ago, and sir walter\\nmight be excused, therefore, in forgetting her age, or, at least,\\nbe deemed only half a fool, for thinking himself and elizabeth\\nas blooming as ever, amidst the wreck of the good looks of everybody else;\\nfor he could plainly see how old all the rest of his family and\\nacquaintance were growing.  anne haggard, mary coarse, every face\\nin the neighbourhood worsting, and the rapid increase of the crow\\'s foot\\nabout lady russell\\'s temples had long been a distress to him.\\n\\nelizabeth did not quite equal her father in personal contentment.\\nthirteen years had seen her mistress of kellynch hall, presiding and\\ndirecting with a self-possession and decision which could never have given\\nthe idea of her being younger than she was.  for thirteen years had\\nshe been doing the honours, and laying down the domestic law at home,\\nand leading the way to the chaise and four, and walking immediately after\\nlady russell out of all the drawing-rooms and dining-rooms in the country.\\nthirteen winters\\' revolving frosts had seen her opening every ball\\nof credit which a scanty neighbourhood afforded, and thirteen springs\\nshewn their blossoms, as she travelled up to london with her father,\\nfor a few weeks\\' annual enjoyment of the great world.  she had\\nthe remembrance of all this, she had the consciousness of being\\nnine-and-twenty to give her some regrets and some apprehensions;\\nshe was fully satisfied of being still quite as handsome as ever,\\nbut she felt her approach to the years of danger, and would have rejoiced\\nto be certain of being properly solicited by baronet-blood within\\nthe next twelvemonth or two.  then might she again take up\\nthe book of books with as much enjoyment as in her early youth,\\nbut now she liked it not.  always to be presented with the date of\\nher own birth and see no marriage follow but that of a youngest sister,\\nmade the book an evil; and more than once, when her father had left it\\nopen on the table near her, had she closed it, with averted eyes,\\nand pushed it away.\\n\\nshe had had a disappointment, moreover, which that book,\\nand especially the history of her own family, must ever present\\nthe remembrance of.  the heir presumptive, the very william walter\\nelliot, esq., whose rights had been so generously supported\\nby her father, had disappointed her.\\n\\nshe had, while a very young girl, as soon as she had known him to be,\\nin the event of her having no brother, the future baronet,\\nmeant to marry him, and her father had always meant that she should.\\nhe had not been known to them as a boy; but soon after lady elliot\\'s death,\\nsir walter had sought the acquaintance, and though his overtures\\nhad not been met with any warmth, he had persevered in seeking it,\\nmaking allowance for the modest drawing-back of youth; and, in one of\\ntheir spring excursions to london, when elizabeth was in her first bloom,\\nmr elliot had been forced into the introduction.\\n\\nhe was at that time a very young man, just engaged in the study of the law;\\nand elizabeth found him extremely agreeable, and every plan in his favour\\nwas confirmed.  he was invited to kellynch hall; he was talked of\\nand expected all the rest of the year; but he never came.\\nthe following spring he was seen again in town, found equally agreeable,\\nagain encouraged, invited, and expected, and again he did not come;\\nand the next tidings were that he was married.  instead of pushing\\nhis fortune in the line marked out for the heir of the house of elliot,\\nhe had purchased independence by uniting himself to a rich woman\\nof inferior birth.\\n\\nsir walter has resented it.  as the head of the house, he felt that\\nhe ought to have been consulted, especially after taking the young man\\nso publicly by the hand; \"for they must have been seen together,\"\\nhe observed, \"once at tattersall\\'s, and twice in the lobby of\\nthe house of commons.\"  his disapprobation was expressed,\\nbut apparently very little regarded.  mr elliot had attempted no apology,\\nand shewn himself as unsolicitous of being longer noticed by the family,\\nas sir walter considered him unworthy of it:  all acquaintance between\\nthem had ceased.\\n\\nthis very awkward history of mr elliot was still, after an interval\\nof several years, felt with anger by elizabeth, who had liked the man\\nfor himself, and still more for being her father\\'s heir, and whose\\nstrong family pride could see only in him a proper match for sir walter\\nelliot\\'s eldest daughter.  there was not a baronet from a to z whom\\nher feelings could have so willingly acknowledged as an equal.\\nyet so miserably had he conducted himself, that though she was\\nat this present time (the summer of 1814) wearing black ribbons\\nfor his wife, she could not admit him to be worth thinking of again.\\nthe disgrace of his first marriage might, perhaps, as there was\\nno reason to suppose it perpetuated by offspring, have been got over,\\nhad he not done worse; but he had, as by the accustomary intervention\\nof kind friends, they had been informed, spoken most disrespectfully\\nof them all, most slightingly and contemptuously of the very blood\\nhe belonged to, and the honours which were hereafter to be his own.\\nthis could not be pardoned.\\n\\nsuch were elizabeth elliot\\'s sentiments and sensations; such the cares\\nto alloy, the agitations to vary, the sameness and the elegance,\\nthe prosperity and the nothingness of her scene of life;\\nsuch the feelings to give interest to a long, uneventful residence\\nin one country circle, to fill the vacancies which there were no habits\\nof utility abroad, no talents or accomplishments for home, to occupy.\\n\\nbut now, another occupation and solicitude of mind was beginning to be\\nadded to these.  her father was growing distressed for money.\\nshe knew, that when he now took up the baronetage, it was to drive\\nthe heavy bills of his tradespeople, and the unwelcome hints of\\nmr shepherd, his agent, from his thoughts.  the kellynch property was good,\\nbut not equal to sir walter\\'s apprehension of the state required\\nin its possessor.  while lady elliot lived, there had been method,\\nmoderation, and economy, which had just kept him within his income;\\nbut with her had died all such right-mindedness, and from that period\\nhe had been constantly exceeding it.  it had not been possible\\nfor him to spend less; he had done nothing but what sir walter elliot\\nwas imperiously called on to do; but blameless as he was, he was\\nnot only growing dreadfully in debt, but was hearing of it so often,\\nthat it became vain to attempt concealing it longer, even partially,\\nfrom his daughter.  he had given her some hints of it the last spring\\nin town; he had gone so far even as to say, \"can we retrench?\\ndoes it occur to you that there is any one article in which\\nwe can retrench?\" and elizabeth, to do her justice, had, in the first\\nardour of female alarm, set seriously to think what could be done,\\nand had finally proposed these two branches of economy, to cut off\\nsome unnecessary charities, and to refrain from new furnishing\\nthe drawing-room; to which expedients she afterwards added\\nthe happy thought of their taking no present down to anne,\\nas had been the usual yearly custom.  but these measures,\\nhowever good in themselves, were insufficient for the real extent\\nof the evil, the whole of which sir walter found himself obliged\\nto confess to her soon afterwards.  elizabeth had nothing to propose\\nof deeper efficacy.  she felt herself ill-used and unfortunate,\\nas did her father; and they were neither of them able to devise\\nany means of lessening their expenses without compromising their dignity,\\nor relinquishing their comforts in a way not to be borne.\\n\\nthere was only a small part of his estate that sir walter could dispose of;\\nbut had every acre been alienable, it would have made no difference.\\nhe had condescended to mortgage as far as he had the power,\\nbut he would never condescend to sell.  no; he would never disgrace\\nhis name so far.  the kellynch estate should be transmitted whole\\nand entire, as he had received it.\\n\\ntheir two confidential friends, mr shepherd, who lived in\\nthe neighbouring market town, and lady russell, were called to advise them;\\nand both father and daughter seemed to expect that something should be\\nstruck out by one or the other to remove their embarrassments\\nand reduce their expenditure, without involving the loss of\\nany indulgence of taste or pride.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 2\\n\\n\\nmr shepherd, a civil, cautious lawyer, who, whatever might be his hold\\nor his views on sir walter, would rather have the disagreeable\\nprompted by anybody else, excused himself from offering the slightest hint,\\nand only begged leave to recommend an implicit reference to\\nthe excellent judgement of lady russell, from whose known good sense\\nhe fully expected to have just such resolute measures advised as\\nhe meant to see finally adopted.\\n\\nlady russell was most anxiously zealous on the subject, and gave it\\nmuch serious consideration.  she was a woman rather of sound than of\\nquick abilities, whose difficulties in coming to any decision\\nin this instance were great, from the opposition of two leading principles.\\nshe was of strict integrity herself, with a delicate sense of honour;\\nbut she was as desirous of saving sir walter\\'s feelings, as solicitous\\nfor the credit of the family, as aristocratic in her ideas of what\\nwas due to them, as anybody of sense and honesty could well be.\\nshe was a benevolent, charitable, good woman, and capable of\\nstrong attachments, most correct in her conduct, strict in her notions\\nof decorum, and with manners that were held a standard of good-breeding.\\nshe had a cultivated mind, and was, generally speaking,\\nrational and consistent; but she had prejudices on the side of ancestry;\\nshe had a value for rank and consequence, which blinded her a little\\nto the faults of those who possessed them.  herself the widow of\\nonly a knight, she gave the dignity of a baronet all its due;\\nand sir walter, independent of his claims as an old acquaintance,\\nan attentive neighbour, an obliging landlord, the husband of her\\nvery dear friend, the father of anne and her sisters, was,\\nas being sir walter, in her apprehension, entitled to a great deal\\nof compassion and consideration under his present difficulties.\\n\\nthey must retrench; that did not admit of a doubt.  but she was\\nvery anxious to have it done with the least possible pain to him\\nand elizabeth. she drew up plans of economy, she made exact calculations,\\nand she did what nobody else thought of doing:  she consulted anne,\\nwho never seemed considered by the others as having any interest\\nin the question. she consulted, and in a degree was influenced by her\\nin marking out the scheme of retrenchment which was at last submitted\\nto sir walter. every emendation of anne\\'s had been on the side of\\nhonesty against importance.  she wanted more vigorous measures,\\na more complete reformation, a quicker release from debt,\\na much higher tone of indifference for everything but justice and equity.\\n\\n\"if we can persuade your father to all this,\" said lady russell,\\nlooking over her paper, \"much may be done.  if he will adopt\\nthese regulations, in seven years he will be clear; and i hope\\nwe may be able to convince him and elizabeth, that kellynch hall has\\na respectability in itself which cannot be affected by these reductions;\\nand that the true dignity of sir walter elliot will be very far from\\nlessened in the eyes of sensible people, by acting like a man of principle.\\nwhat will he be doing, in fact, but what very many of our first families\\nhave done, or ought to do?  there will be nothing singular in his case;\\nand it is singularity which often makes the worst part of our suffering,\\nas it always does of our conduct.  i have great hope of prevailing.\\nwe must be serious and decided; for after all, the person who\\nhas contracted debts must pay them; and though a great deal is due to\\nthe feelings of the gentleman, and the head of a house, like your father,\\nthere is still more due to the character of an honest man.\"\\n\\nthis was the principle on which anne wanted her father to be proceeding,\\nhis friends to be urging him.  she considered it as an act\\nof indispensable duty to clear away the claims of creditors with\\nall the expedition which the most comprehensive retrenchments\\ncould secure, and saw no dignity in anything short of it.\\nshe wanted it to be prescribed, and felt as a duty.  she rated\\nlady russell\\'s influence highly; and as to the severe degree\\nof self-denial which her own conscience prompted, she believed\\nthere might be little more difficulty in persuading them to a complete,\\nthan to half a reformation.  her knowledge of her father\\nand elizabeth inclined her to think that the sacrifice of one pair\\nof horses would be hardly less painful than of both, and so on,\\nthrough the whole list of lady russell\\'s too gentle reductions.\\n\\nhow anne\\'s more rigid requisitions might have been taken\\nis of little consequence.  lady russell\\'s had no success at all:\\ncould not be put up with, were not to be borne. \"what! every comfort\\nof life knocked off!  journeys, london, servants, horses, table--\\ncontractions and restrictions every where!  to live no longer\\nwith the decencies even of a private gentleman!  no, he would sooner\\nquit kellynch hall at once, than remain in it on such disgraceful terms.\"\\n\\n\"quit kellynch hall.\"  the hint was immediately taken up by mr shepherd,\\nwhose interest was involved in the reality of sir walter\\'s retrenching,\\nand who was perfectly persuaded that nothing would be done without\\na change of abode.  \"since the idea had been started in the very quarter\\nwhich ought to dictate, he had no scruple,\" he said, \"in confessing\\nhis judgement to be entirely on that side.  it did not appear to him\\nthat sir walter could materially alter his style of living in a house\\nwhich had such a character of hospitality and ancient dignity to support.\\nin any other place sir walter might judge for himself; and would\\nbe looked up to, as regulating the modes of life in whatever way\\nhe might choose to model his household.\"\\n\\nsir walter would quit kellynch hall; and after a very few days more\\nof doubt and indecision, the great question of whither he should go\\nwas settled, and the first outline of this important change made out.\\n\\nthere had been three alternatives, london, bath, or another house\\nin the country.  all anne\\'s wishes had been for the latter.\\na small house in their own neighbourhood, where they might still have\\nlady russell\\'s society, still be near mary, and still have the pleasure\\nof sometimes seeing the lawns and groves of kellynch, was the object\\nof her ambition.  but the usual fate of anne attended her,\\nin having something very opposite from her inclination fixed on.\\nshe disliked bath, and did not think it agreed with her;\\nand bath was to be her home.\\n\\nsir walter had at first thought more of london; but mr shepherd felt\\nthat he could not be trusted in london, and had been skilful enough\\nto dissuade him from it, and make bath preferred.  it was a much safer\\nplace for a gentleman in his predicament:  he might there be important\\nat comparatively little expense.  two material advantages of bath\\nover london had of course been given all their weight:  its more convenient\\ndistance from kellynch, only fifty miles, and lady russell\\'s spending\\nsome part of every winter there; and to the very great satisfaction\\nof lady russell, whose first views on the projected change had been\\nfor bath, sir walter and elizabeth were induced to believe that\\nthey should lose neither consequence nor enjoyment by settling there.\\n\\nlady russell felt obliged to oppose her dear anne\\'s known wishes.\\nit would be too much to expect sir walter to descend into a small house\\nin his own neighbourhood.  anne herself would have found\\nthe mortifications of it more than she foresaw, and to sir walter\\'s\\nfeelings they must have been dreadful.  and with regard to anne\\'s\\ndislike of bath, she considered it as a prejudice and mistake arising,\\nfirst, from the circumstance of her having been three years\\nat school there, after her mother\\'s death; and secondly,\\nfrom her happening to be not in perfectly good spirits the only winter\\nwhich she had afterwards spent there with herself.\\n\\nlady russell was fond of bath, in short, and disposed to think\\nit must suit them all; and as to her young friend\\'s health,\\nby passing all the warm months with her at kellynch lodge,\\nevery danger would be avoided; and it was in fact, a change which must\\ndo both health and spirits good.  anne had been too little from home,\\ntoo little seen. her spirits were not high.  a larger society\\nwould improve them.  she wanted her to be more known.\\n\\nthe undesirableness of any other house in the same neighbourhood\\nfor sir walter was certainly much strengthened by one part,\\nand a very material part of the scheme, which had been happily\\nengrafted on the beginning.  he was not only to quit his home,\\nbut to see it in the hands of others; a trial of fortitude,\\nwhich stronger heads than sir walter\\'s have found too much.\\nkellynch hall was to be let.  this, however, was a profound secret,\\nnot to be breathed beyond their own circle.\\n\\nsir walter could not have borne the degradation of being known\\nto design letting his house.  mr shepherd had once mentioned the word\\n\"advertise,\" but never dared approach it again.  sir walter spurned\\nthe idea of its being offered in any manner; forbad the slightest hint\\nbeing dropped of his having such an intention; and it was only on\\nthe supposition of his being spontaneously solicited by some most\\nunexceptionable applicant, on his own terms, and as a great favour,\\nthat he would let it at all.\\n\\nhow quick come the reasons for approving what we like!  lady russell had\\nanother excellent one at hand, for being extremely glad that sir walter\\nand his family were to remove from the country.  elizabeth had been\\nlately forming an intimacy, which she wished to see interrupted.\\nit was with the daughter of mr shepherd, who had returned,\\nafter an unprosperous marriage, to her father\\'s house, with\\nthe additional burden of two children.  she was a clever young woman,\\nwho understood the art of pleasing--the art of pleasing, at least,\\nat kellynch hall; and who had made herself so acceptable to miss elliot,\\nas to have been already staying there more than once, in spite of all\\nthat lady russell, who thought it a friendship quite out of place,\\ncould hint of caution and reserve.\\n\\nlady russell, indeed, had scarcely any influence with elizabeth,\\nand seemed to love her, rather because she would love her,\\nthan because elizabeth deserved it.  she had never received from her more\\nthan outward attention, nothing beyond the observances of complaisance;\\nhad never succeeded in any point which she wanted to carry,\\nagainst previous inclination.  she had been repeatedly very earnest\\nin trying to get anne included in the visit to london, sensibly open\\nto all the injustice and all the discredit of the selfish arrangements\\nwhich shut her out, and on many lesser occasions had endeavoured\\nto give elizabeth the advantage of her own better judgement and experience;\\nbut always in vain:  elizabeth would go her own way; and never had she\\npursued it in more decided opposition to lady russell than in\\nthis selection of mrs clay; turning from the society of so deserving\\na sister, to bestow her affection and confidence on one who ought\\nto have been nothing to her but the object of distant civility.\\n\\nfrom situation, mrs clay was, in lady russell\\'s estimate, a very unequal,\\nand in her character she believed a very dangerous companion;\\nand a removal that would leave mrs clay behind, and bring a choice\\nof more suitable intimates within miss elliot\\'s reach, was therefore\\nan object of first-rate importance.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 3\\n\\n\\n\"i must take leave to observe, sir walter,\" said mr shepherd\\none morning at kellynch hall, as he laid down the newspaper,\\n\"that the present juncture is much in our favour.  this peace will\\nbe turning all our rich naval officers ashore.  they will be\\nall wanting a home.  could not be a better time, sir walter,\\nfor having a choice of tenants, very responsible tenants.\\nmany a noble fortune has been made during the war.  if a rich admiral\\nwere to come in our way, sir walter--\"\\n\\n\"he would be a very lucky man, shepherd,\" replied sir walter;\\n\"that\\'s all i have to remark.  a prize indeed would kellynch hall\\nbe to him; rather the greatest prize of all, let him have taken\\never so many before; hey, shepherd?\"\\n\\nmr shepherd laughed, as he knew he must, at this wit, and then added--\\n\\n\"i presume to observe, sir walter, that, in the way of business,\\ngentlemen of the navy are well to deal with.  i have had a little knowledge\\nof their methods of doing business; and i am free to confess that they\\nhave very liberal notions, and are as likely to make desirable tenants\\nas any set of people one should meet with.  therefore, sir walter,\\nwhat i would take leave to suggest is, that if in consequence of\\nany rumours getting abroad of your intention; which must be contemplated\\nas a possible thing, because we know how difficult it is to keep\\nthe actions and designs of one part of the world from the notice\\nand curiosity of the other; consequence has its tax; i, john shepherd,\\nmight conceal any family-matters that i chose, for nobody would think it\\nworth their while to observe me; but sir walter elliot has eyes upon him\\nwhich it may be very difficult to elude; and therefore, thus much\\ni venture upon, that it will not greatly surprise me if,\\nwith all our caution, some rumour of the truth should get abroad;\\nin the supposition of which, as i was going to observe, since applications\\nwill unquestionably follow, i should think any from our wealthy\\nnaval commanders particularly worth attending to; and beg leave to add,\\nthat two hours will bring me over at any time, to save you\\nthe trouble of replying.\"\\n\\nsir walter only nodded.  but soon afterwards, rising and pacing the room,\\nhe observed sarcastically--\\n\\n\"there are few among the gentlemen of the navy, i imagine, who would\\nnot be surprised to find themselves in a house of this description.\"\\n\\n\"they would look around them, no doubt, and bless their good fortune,\"\\nsaid mrs clay, for mrs clay was present:  her father had driven her over,\\nnothing being of so much use to mrs clay\\'s health as a drive to kellynch:\\n\"but i quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might be\\na very desirable tenant.  i have known a good deal of the profession;\\nand besides their liberality, they are so neat and careful\\nin all their ways!  these valuable pictures of yours, sir walter,\\nif you chose to leave them, would be perfectly safe.  everything in\\nand about the house would be taken such excellent care of!\\nthe gardens and shrubberies would be kept in almost as high order\\nas they are now.  you need not be afraid, miss elliot, of your own\\nsweet flower gardens being neglected.\"\\n\\n\"as to all that,\" rejoined sir walter coolly, \"supposing i were induced\\nto let my house, i have by no means made up my mind as to the privileges\\nto be annexed to it.  i am not particularly disposed to favour a tenant.\\nthe park would be open to him of course, and few navy officers,\\nor men of any other description, can have had such a range;\\nbut what restrictions i might impose on the use of the pleasure-grounds,\\nis another thing.  i am not fond of the idea of my shrubberies being\\nalways approachable; and i should recommend miss elliot to be on her guard\\nwith respect to her flower garden.  i am very little disposed\\nto grant a tenant of kellynch hall any extraordinary favour,\\ni assure you, be he sailor or soldier.\"\\n\\nafter a short pause, mr shepherd presumed to say--\\n\\n\"in all these cases, there are established usages which\\nmake everything plain and easy between landlord and tenant.\\nyour interest, sir walter, is in pretty safe hands.  depend upon me\\nfor taking care that no tenant has more than his just rights.\\ni venture to hint, that sir walter elliot cannot be half so jealous\\nfor his own, as john shepherd will be for him.\"\\n\\nhere anne spoke--\\n\\n\"the navy, i think, who have done so much for us, have at least\\nan equal claim with any other set of men, for all the comforts and\\nall the privileges which any home can give.  sailors work hard enough\\nfor their comforts, we must all allow.\"\\n\\n\"very true, very true.  what miss anne says, is very true,\"\\nwas mr shepherd\\'s rejoinder, and \"oh! certainly,\" was his daughter\\'s;\\nbut sir walter\\'s remark was, soon afterwards--\\n\\n\"the profession has its utility, but i should be sorry to see\\nany friend of mine belonging to it.\"\\n\\n\"indeed!\" was the reply, and with a look of surprise.\\n\\n\"yes; it is in two points offensive to me; i have two strong grounds\\nof objection to it.  first, as being the means of bringing persons\\nof obscure birth into undue distinction, and raising men to honours\\nwhich their fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of; and secondly,\\nas it cuts up a man\\'s youth and vigour most horribly; a sailor grows old\\nsooner than any other man.  i have observed it all my life.\\na man is in greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise\\nof one whose father, his father might have disdained to speak to,\\nand of becoming prematurely an object of disgust himself, than in\\nany other line.  one day last spring, in town, i was in company\\nwith two men, striking instances of what i am talking of;\\nlord st ives, whose father we all know to have been a country curate,\\nwithout bread to eat; i was to give place to lord st ives,\\nand a certain admiral baldwin, the most deplorable-looking personage\\nyou can imagine; his face the colour of mahogany, rough and rugged\\nto the last degree; all lines and wrinkles, nine grey hairs of a side,\\nand nothing but a dab of powder at top.  `in the name of heaven,\\nwho is that old fellow?\\' said i to a friend of mine who was standing near,\\n(sir basil morley).  `old fellow!\\' cried sir basil, `it is admiral baldwin.\\nwhat do you take his age to be?\\'  `sixty,\\' said i, `or perhaps sixty-two.\\'\\n`forty,\\' replied sir basil, `forty, and no more.\\'  picture to yourselves\\nmy amazement; i shall not easily forget admiral baldwin.\\ni never saw quite so wretched an example of what a sea-faring life can do;\\nbut to a degree, i know it is the same with them all:  they are all\\nknocked about, and exposed to every climate, and every weather,\\ntill they are not fit to be seen.  it is a pity they are not knocked\\non the head at once, before they reach admiral baldwin\\'s age.\"\\n\\n\"nay, sir walter,\" cried mrs clay, \"this is being severe indeed.\\nhave a little mercy on the poor men.  we are not all born to be handsome.\\nthe sea is no beautifier, certainly; sailors do grow old betimes;\\ni have observed it; they soon lose the look of youth.  but then,\\nis not it the same with many other professions, perhaps most other?\\nsoldiers, in active service, are not at all better off:  and even in\\nthe quieter professions, there is a toil and a labour of the mind,\\nif not of the body, which seldom leaves a man\\'s looks to the natural\\neffect of time.  the lawyer plods, quite care-worn; the physician\\nis up at all hours, and travelling in all weather; and even\\nthe clergyman--\" she stopt a moment to consider what might\\ndo for the clergyman;--\"and even the clergyman, you know is obliged\\nto go into infected rooms, and expose his health and looks to\\nall the injury of a poisonous atmosphere.  in fact, as i have\\nlong been convinced, though every profession is necessary and honourable\\nin its turn, it is only the lot of those who are not obliged to follow any,\\nwho can live in a regular way, in the country, choosing their own hours,\\nfollowing their own pursuits, and living on their own property,\\nwithout the torment of trying for more; it is only their lot, i say,\\nto hold the blessings of health and a good appearance to the utmost:\\ni know no other set of men but what lose something of their personableness\\nwhen they cease to be quite young.\"\\n\\nit seemed as if mr shepherd, in this anxiety to bespeak\\nsir walter\\'s good will towards a naval officer as tenant,\\nhad been gifted with foresight; for the very first application\\nfor the house was from an admiral croft, with whom he shortly afterwards\\nfell into company in attending the quarter sessions at taunton; and indeed,\\nhe had received a hint of the admiral from a london correspondent.\\nby the report which he hastened over to kellynch to make,\\nadmiral croft was a native of somersetshire, who having acquired\\na very handsome fortune, was wishing to settle in his own country,\\nand had come down to taunton in order to look at some advertised places\\nin that immediate neighbourhood, which, however, had not suited him;\\nthat accidentally hearing--(it was just as he had foretold,\\nmr shepherd observed, sir walter\\'s concerns could not be kept a secret,)--\\naccidentally hearing of the possibility of kellynch hall being to let,\\nand understanding his (mr shepherd\\'s) connection with the owner,\\nhe had introduced himself to him in order to make particular inquiries,\\nand had, in the course of a pretty long conference, expressed as strong\\nan inclination for the place as a man who knew it only by description\\ncould feel; and given mr shepherd, in his explicit account of himself,\\nevery proof of his being a most responsible, eligible tenant.\\n\\n\"and who is admiral croft?\" was sir walter\\'s cold suspicious inquiry.\\n\\nmr shepherd answered for his being of a gentleman\\'s family,\\nand mentioned a place; and anne, after the little pause which followed,\\nadded--\\n\\n\"he is a rear admiral of the white.  he was in the trafalgar action,\\nand has been in the east indies since; he was stationed there,\\ni believe, several years.\"\\n\\n\"then i take it for granted,\" observed sir walter, \"that his face\\nis about as orange as the cuffs and capes of my livery.\"\\n\\nmr shepherd hastened to assure him, that admiral croft was a very hale,\\nhearty, well-looking man, a little weather-beaten, to be sure,\\nbut not much, and quite the gentleman in all his notions and behaviour;\\nnot likely to make the smallest difficulty about terms, only wanted\\na comfortable home, and to get into it as soon as possible;\\nknew he must pay for his convenience; knew what rent a ready-furnished\\nhouse of that consequence might fetch; should not have been surprised\\nif sir walter had asked more; had inquired about the manor;\\nwould be glad of the deputation, certainly, but made no great point of it;\\nsaid he sometimes took out a gun, but never killed; quite the gentleman.\\n\\nmr shepherd was eloquent on the subject; pointing out all\\nthe circumstances of the admiral\\'s family, which made him\\npeculiarly desirable as a tenant.  he was a married man,\\nand without children; the very state to be wished for.  a house was\\nnever taken good care of, mr shepherd observed, without a lady:\\nhe did not know, whether furniture might not be in danger of suffering\\nas much where there was no lady, as where there were many children.\\na lady, without a family, was the very best preserver of furniture\\nin the world.  he had seen mrs croft, too; she was at taunton\\nwith the admiral, and had been present almost all the time they were\\ntalking the matter over.\\n\\n\"and a very well-spoken, genteel, shrewd lady, she seemed to be,\"\\ncontinued he; \"asked more questions about the house, and terms,\\nand taxes, than the admiral himself, and seemed more conversant\\nwith business; and moreover, sir walter, i found she was not quite\\nunconnected in this country, any more than her husband; that is to say,\\nshe is sister to a gentleman who did live amongst us once;\\nshe told me so herself:  sister to the gentleman who lived\\na few years back at monkford.  bless me! what was his name?\\nat this moment i cannot recollect his name, though i have heard it so lately.\\npenelope, my dear, can you help me to the name of the gentleman\\nwho lived at monkford:  mrs croft\\'s brother?\"\\n\\nbut mrs clay was talking so eagerly with miss elliot, that she did not\\nhear the appeal.\\n\\n\"i have no conception whom you can mean, shepherd; i remember\\nno gentleman resident at monkford since the time of old governor trent.\"\\n\\n\"bless me! how very odd!  i shall forget my own name soon, i suppose.\\na name that i am so very well acquainted with; knew the gentleman\\nso well by sight; seen him a hundred times; came to consult me once,\\ni remember, about a trespass of one of his neighbours; farmer\\'s man\\nbreaking into his orchard; wall torn down; apples stolen;\\ncaught in the fact; and afterwards, contrary to my judgement,\\nsubmitted to an amicable compromise.  very odd indeed!\"\\n\\nafter waiting another moment--\\n\\n\"you mean mr wentworth, i suppose?\" said anne.\\n\\nmr shepherd was all gratitude.\\n\\n\"wentworth was the very name!  mr wentworth was the very man.\\nhe had the curacy of monkford, you know, sir walter, some time back,\\nfor two or three years.  came there about the year ---5, i take it.\\nyou remember him, i am sure.\"\\n\\n\"wentworth?  oh! ay,--mr wentworth, the curate of monkford.\\nyou misled me by the term gentleman.  i thought you were speaking of\\nsome man of property:  mr wentworth was nobody, i remember;\\nquite unconnected; nothing to do with the strafford family.\\none wonders how the names of many of our nobility become so common.\"\\n\\nas mr shepherd perceived that this connexion of the crofts did them\\nno service with sir walter, he mentioned it no more; returning,\\nwith all his zeal, to dwell on the circumstances more indisputably\\nin their favour; their age, and number, and fortune; the high idea\\nthey had formed of kellynch hall, and extreme solicitude for\\nthe advantage of renting it; making it appear as if they ranked\\nnothing beyond the happiness of being the tenants of sir walter elliot:\\nan extraordinary taste, certainly, could they have been supposed in\\nthe secret of sir walter\\'s estimate of the dues of a tenant.\\n\\nit succeeded, however; and though sir walter must ever look with\\nan evil eye on anyone intending to inhabit that house, and think them\\ninfinitely too well off in being permitted to rent it on the highest terms,\\nhe was talked into allowing mr shepherd to proceed in the treaty,\\nand authorising him to wait on admiral croft, who still remained\\nat taunton, and fix a day for the house being seen.\\n\\nsir walter was not very wise; but still he had experience enough\\nof the world to feel, that a more unobjectionable tenant,\\nin all essentials, than admiral croft bid fair to be, could hardly offer.\\nso far went his understanding; and his vanity supplied a little\\nadditional soothing, in the admiral\\'s situation in life, which was just\\nhigh enough, and not too high.  \"i have let my house to admiral croft,\"\\nwould sound extremely well; very much better than to any mere mr--;\\na mr (save, perhaps, some half dozen in the nation,) always needs\\na note of explanation.  an admiral speaks his own consequence,\\nand, at the same time, can never make a baronet look small.\\nin all their dealings and intercourse, sir walter elliot must ever\\nhave the precedence.\\n\\nnothing could be done without a reference to elizabeth:\\nbut her inclination was growing so strong for a removal,\\nthat she was happy to have it fixed and expedited by a tenant at hand;\\nand not a word to suspend decision was uttered by her.\\n\\nmr shepherd was completely empowered to act; and no sooner had\\nsuch an end been reached, than anne, who had been a most attentive listener\\nto the whole, left the room, to seek the comfort of cool air for her\\nflushed cheeks; and as she walked along a favourite grove, said,\\nwith a gentle sigh, \"a few months more, and he, perhaps,\\nmay be walking here.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 4\\n\\n\\nhe was not mr wentworth, the former curate of monkford,\\nhowever suspicious appearances may be, but a captain frederick wentworth,\\nhis brother, who being made commander in consequence of the action\\noff st domingo, and not immediately employed, had come into somersetshire,\\nin the summer of 1806; and having no parent living, found a home\\nfor half a year at monkford.  he was, at that time, a remarkably fine\\nyoung man, with a great deal of intelligence, spirit, and brilliancy;\\nand anne an extremely pretty girl, with gentleness, modesty, taste,\\nand feeling.  half the sum of attraction, on either side, might have\\nbeen enough, for he had nothing to do, and she had hardly anybody to love;\\nbut the encounter of such lavish recommendations could not fail.\\nthey were gradually acquainted, and when acquainted, rapidly and\\ndeeply in love.  it would be difficult to say which had seen\\nhighest perfection in the other, or which had been the happiest:\\nshe, in receiving his declarations and proposals, or he in\\nhaving them accepted.\\n\\na short period of exquisite felicity followed, and but a short one.\\ntroubles soon arose.  sir walter, on being applied to, without actually\\nwithholding his consent, or saying it should never be, gave it all\\nthe negative of great astonishment, great coldness, great silence,\\nand a professed resolution of doing nothing for his daughter.\\nhe thought it a very degrading alliance; and lady russell, though with\\nmore tempered and pardonable pride, received it as a most unfortunate one.\\n\\nanne elliot, with all her claims of birth, beauty, and mind,\\nto throw herself away at nineteen; involve herself at nineteen\\nin an engagement with a young man, who had nothing but himself\\nto recommend him, and no hopes of attaining affluence, but in the chances\\nof a most uncertain profession, and no connexions to secure\\neven his farther rise in the profession, would be, indeed, a throwing away,\\nwhich she grieved to think of!  anne elliot, so young; known to so few,\\nto be snatched off by a stranger without alliance or fortune;\\nor rather sunk by him into a state of most wearing, anxious,\\nyouth-killing dependence!  it must not be, if by any fair interference\\nof friendship, any representations from one who had almost a mother\\'s love,\\nand mother\\'s rights, it would be prevented.\\n\\ncaptain wentworth had no fortune.  he had been lucky in his profession;\\nbut spending freely, what had come freely, had realized nothing.\\nbut he was confident that he should soon be rich:\\nfull of life and ardour, he knew that he should soon have a ship,\\nand soon be on a station that would lead to everything he wanted.\\nhe had always been lucky; he knew he should be so still.\\nsuch confidence, powerful in its own warmth, and bewitching in\\nthe wit which often expressed it, must have been enough for anne;\\nbut lady russell saw it very differently.  his sanguine temper,\\nand fearlessness of mind, operated very differently on her.\\nshe saw in it but an aggravation of the evil.  it only added a\\ndangerous character to himself.  he was brilliant, he was headstrong.\\nlady russell had little taste for wit, and of anything approaching\\nto imprudence a horror.  she deprecated the connexion in every light.\\n\\nsuch opposition, as these feelings produced, was more than\\nanne could combat.  young and gentle as she was, it might yet\\nhave been possible to withstand her father\\'s ill-will,\\nthough unsoftened by one kind word or look on the part of her sister;\\nbut lady russell, whom she had always loved and relied on, could not,\\nwith such steadiness of opinion, and such tenderness of manner,\\nbe continually advising her in vain.  she was persuaded to believe\\nthe engagement a wrong thing:  indiscreet, improper, hardly capable\\nof success, and not deserving it.  but it was not a merely selfish caution,\\nunder which she acted, in putting an end to it.  had she not\\nimagined herself consulting his good, even more than her own,\\nshe could hardly have given him up.  the belief of being prudent,\\nand self-denying, principally for his advantage, was her chief consolation,\\nunder the misery of a parting, a final parting; and every consolation\\nwas required, for she had to encounter all the additional pain of opinions,\\non his side, totally unconvinced and unbending, and of his feeling himself\\nill used by so forced a relinquishment.  he had left the country\\nin consequence.\\n\\na few months had seen the beginning and the end of their acquaintance;\\nbut not with a few months ended anne\\'s share of suffering from it.\\nher attachment and regrets had, for a long time, clouded every\\nenjoyment of youth, and an early loss of bloom and spirits\\nhad been their lasting effect.\\n\\nmore than seven years were gone since this little history\\nof sorrowful interest had reached its close; and time had\\nsoftened down much, perhaps nearly all of peculiar attachment to him,\\nbut she had been too dependent on time alone; no aid had been given\\nin change of place (except in one visit to bath soon after the rupture),\\nor in any novelty or enlargement of society.  no one had ever\\ncome within the kellynch circle, who could bear a comparison with\\nfrederick wentworth, as he stood in her memory.  no second attachment,\\nthe only thoroughly natural, happy, and sufficient cure,\\nat her time of life, had been possible to the nice tone of her mind,\\nthe fastidiousness of her taste, in the small limits of the society\\naround them.  she had been solicited, when about two-and-twenty,\\nto change her name, by the young man, who not long afterwards found\\na more willing mind in her younger sister; and lady russell had\\nlamented her refusal; for charles musgrove was the eldest son of a man,\\nwhose landed property and general importance were second in that country,\\nonly to sir walter\\'s, and of good character and appearance;\\nand however lady russell might have asked yet for something more,\\nwhile anne was nineteen, she would have rejoiced to see her at twenty-two\\nso respectably removed from the partialities and injustice of\\nher father\\'s house, and settled so permanently near herself.\\nbut in this case, anne had left nothing for advice to do;\\nand though lady russell, as satisfied as ever with her own discretion,\\nnever wished the past undone, she began now to have the anxiety\\nwhich borders on hopelessness for anne\\'s being tempted, by some man\\nof talents and independence, to enter a state for which she held her\\nto be peculiarly fitted by her warm affections and domestic habits.\\n\\nthey knew not each other\\'s opinion, either its constancy or its change,\\non the one leading point of anne\\'s conduct, for the subject was never\\nalluded to; but anne, at seven-and-twenty, thought very differently\\nfrom what she had been made to think at nineteen.  she did not blame\\nlady russell, she did not blame herself for having been guided by her;\\nbut she felt that were any young person, in similar circumstances,\\nto apply to her for counsel, they would never receive any of such\\ncertain immediate wretchedness, such uncertain future good.\\nshe was persuaded that under every disadvantage of disapprobation at home,\\nand every anxiety attending his profession, all their probable fears,\\ndelays, and disappointments, she should yet have been a happier woman\\nin maintaining the engagement, than she had been in the sacrifice of it;\\nand this, she fully believed, had the usual share, had even more than\\nthe usual share of all such solicitudes and suspense been theirs,\\nwithout reference to the actual results of their case, which,\\nas it happened, would have bestowed earlier prosperity than\\ncould be reasonably calculated on.  all his sanguine expectations,\\nall his confidence had been justified.  his genius and ardour\\nhad seemed to foresee and to command his prosperous path.\\nhe had, very soon after their engagement ceased, got employ:\\nand all that he had told her would follow, had taken place.\\nhe had distinguished himself, and early gained the other step in rank,\\nand must now, by successive captures, have made a handsome fortune.\\nshe had only navy lists and newspapers for her authority,\\nbut she could not doubt his being rich; and, in favour of his constancy,\\nshe had no reason to believe him married.\\n\\nhow eloquent could anne elliot have been! how eloquent, at least,\\nwere her wishes on the side of early warm attachment, and a cheerful\\nconfidence in futurity, against that over-anxious caution which\\nseems to insult exertion and distrust providence!  she had been forced\\ninto prudence in her youth, she learned romance as she grew older:\\nthe natural sequel of an unnatural beginning.\\n\\nwith all these circumstances, recollections and feelings,\\nshe could not hear that captain wentworth\\'s sister was likely\\nto live at kellynch without a revival of former pain; and many a stroll,\\nand many a sigh, were necessary to dispel the agitation of the idea.\\nshe often told herself it was folly, before she could harden her nerves\\nsufficiently to feel the continual discussion of the crofts\\nand their business no evil.  she was assisted, however, by that\\nperfect indifference and apparent unconsciousness, among the only three\\nof her own friends in the secret of the past, which seemed almost to deny\\nany recollection of it.  she could do justice to the superiority\\nof lady russell\\'s motives in this, over those of her father and elizabeth;\\nshe could honour all the better feelings of her calmness;\\nbut the general air of oblivion among them was highly important\\nfrom whatever it sprung; and in the event of admiral croft\\'s really\\ntaking kellynch hall, she rejoiced anew over the conviction which\\nhad always been most grateful to her, of the past being known to\\nthose three only among her connexions, by whom no syllable,\\nshe believed, would ever be whispered, and in the trust that among his,\\nthe brother only with whom he had been residing, had received\\nany information of their short-lived engagement.  that brother had been\\nlong removed from the country and being a sensible man, and, moreover,\\na single man at the time, she had a fond dependence on no human creature\\'s\\nhaving heard of it from him.\\n\\nthe sister, mrs croft, had then been out of england, accompanying\\nher husband on a foreign station, and her own sister, mary,\\nhad been at school while it all occurred; and never admitted by\\nthe pride of some, and the delicacy of others, to the smallest knowledge\\nof it afterwards.\\n\\nwith these supports, she hoped that the acquaintance between herself\\nand the crofts, which, with lady russell, still resident in kellynch,\\nand mary fixed only three miles off, must be anticipated,\\nneed not involve any particular awkwardness.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 5\\n\\n\\non the morning appointed for admiral and mrs croft\\'s seeing kellynch hall,\\nanne found it most natural to take her almost daily walk to lady russell\\'s,\\nand keep out of the way till all was over; when she found it most natural\\nto be sorry that she had missed the opportunity of seeing them.\\n\\nthis meeting of the two parties proved highly satisfactory,\\nand decided the whole business at once.  each lady was previously\\nwell disposed for an agreement, and saw nothing, therefore,\\nbut good manners in the other; and with regard to the gentlemen,\\nthere was such an hearty good humour, such an open, trusting liberality\\non the admiral\\'s side, as could not but influence sir walter,\\nwho had besides been flattered into his very best and most polished\\nbehaviour by mr shepherd\\'s assurances of his being known, by report,\\nto the admiral, as a model of good breeding.\\n\\nthe house and grounds, and furniture, were approved, the crofts\\nwere approved, terms, time, every thing, and every body, was right;\\nand mr shepherd\\'s clerks were set to work, without there having been\\na single preliminary difference to modify of all that\\n\"this indenture sheweth.\"\\n\\nsir walter, without hesitation, declared the admiral to be\\nthe best-looking sailor he had ever met with, and went so far as to say,\\nthat if his own man might have had the arranging of his hair,\\nhe should not be ashamed of being seen with him any where;\\nand the admiral, with sympathetic cordiality, observed to his wife\\nas they drove back through the park, \"i thought we should soon\\ncome to a deal, my dear, in spite of what they told us at taunton.\\nthe baronet will never set the thames on fire, but there seems to be\\nno harm in him.\"  reciprocal compliments, which would have been\\nesteemed about equal.\\n\\nthe crofts were to have possession at michaelmas; and as sir walter\\nproposed removing to bath in the course of the preceding month,\\nthere was no time to be lost in making every dependent arrangement.\\n\\nlady russell, convinced that anne would not be allowed to be of any use,\\nor any importance, in the choice of the house which they were\\ngoing to secure, was very unwilling to have her hurried away so soon,\\nand wanted to make it possible for her to stay behind till she might\\nconvey her to bath herself after christmas; but having engagements\\nof her own which must take her from kellynch for several weeks,\\nshe was unable to give the full invitation she wished, and anne\\nthough dreading the possible heats of september in all the white glare\\nof bath, and grieving to forego all the influence so sweet and so sad\\nof the autumnal months in the country, did not think that,\\neverything considered, she wished to remain.  it would be most right,\\nand most wise, and, therefore must involve least suffering\\nto go with the others.\\n\\nsomething occurred, however, to give her a different duty.\\nmary, often a little unwell, and always thinking a great deal\\nof her own complaints, and always in the habit of claiming anne\\nwhen anything was the matter, was indisposed; and foreseeing\\nthat she should not have a day\\'s health all the autumn, entreated,\\nor rather required her, for it was hardly entreaty, to come to\\nuppercross cottage, and bear her company as long as she should want her,\\ninstead of going to bath.\\n\\n\"i cannot possibly do without anne,\" was mary\\'s reasoning;\\nand elizabeth\\'s reply was, \"then i am sure anne had better stay,\\nfor nobody will want her in bath.\"\\n\\nto be claimed as a good, though in an improper style, is at least\\nbetter than being rejected as no good at all; and anne, glad to\\nbe thought of some use, glad to have anything marked out as a duty,\\nand certainly not sorry to have the scene of it in the country,\\nand her own dear country, readily agreed to stay.\\n\\nthis invitation of mary\\'s removed all lady russell\\'s difficulties,\\nand it was consequently soon settled that anne should not go to bath\\ntill lady russell took her, and that all the intervening time\\nshould be divided between uppercross cottage and kellynch lodge.\\n\\nso far all was perfectly right; but lady russell was almost startled\\nby the wrong of one part of the kellynch hall plan, when it burst on her,\\nwhich was, mrs clay\\'s being engaged to go to bath with sir walter\\nand elizabeth, as a most important and valuable assistant to the latter\\nin all the business before her.  lady russell was extremely sorry\\nthat such a measure should have been resorted to at all, wondered,\\ngrieved, and feared; and the affront it contained to anne,\\nin mrs clay\\'s being of so much use, while anne could be of none,\\nwas a very sore aggravation.\\n\\nanne herself was become hardened to such affronts; but she felt\\nthe imprudence of the arrangement quite as keenly as lady russell.\\nwith a great deal of quiet observation, and a knowledge,\\nwhich she often wished less, of her father\\'s character, she was\\nsensible that results the most serious to his family from the intimacy\\nwere more than possible.  she did not imagine that her father\\nhad at present an idea of the kind.  mrs clay had freckles,\\nand a projecting tooth, and a clumsy wrist, which he was continually\\nmaking severe remarks upon, in her absence; but she was young,\\nand certainly altogether well-looking, and possessed, in an acute mind\\nand assiduous pleasing manners, infinitely more dangerous attractions\\nthan any merely personal might have been.  anne was so impressed\\nby the degree of their danger, that she could not excuse herself\\nfrom trying to make it perceptible to her sister.  she had little hope\\nof success; but elizabeth, who in the event of such a reverse would be\\nso much more to be pitied than herself, should never, she thought,\\nhave reason to reproach her for giving no warning.\\n\\nshe spoke, and seemed only to offend.  elizabeth could not conceive\\nhow such an absurd suspicion should occur to her, and indignantly\\nanswered for each party\\'s perfectly knowing their situation.\\n\\n\"mrs clay,\" said she, warmly, \"never forgets who she is;\\nand as i am rather better acquainted with her sentiments than you can be,\\ni can assure you, that upon the subject of marriage they are\\nparticularly nice, and that she reprobates all inequality of condition\\nand rank more strongly than most people.  and as to my father,\\ni really should not have thought that he, who has kept himself single\\nso long for our sakes, need be suspected now.  if mrs clay were\\na very beautiful woman, i grant you, it might be wrong to have her\\nso much with me; not that anything in the world, i am sure,\\nwould induce my father to make a degrading match, but he might\\nbe rendered unhappy.  but poor mrs clay who, with all her merits,\\ncan never have been reckoned tolerably pretty, i really think poor\\nmrs clay may be staying here in perfect safety.  one would imagine\\nyou had never heard my father speak of her personal misfortunes,\\nthough i know you must fifty times.  that tooth of her\\'s\\nand those freckles.  freckles do not disgust me so very much\\nas they do him.  i have known a face not materially disfigured by a few,\\nbut he abominates them.  you must have heard him notice\\nmrs clay\\'s freckles.\"\\n\\n\"there is hardly any personal defect,\" replied anne,\\n\"which an agreeable manner might not gradually reconcile one to.\"\\n\\n\"i think very differently,\" answered elizabeth, shortly;\\n\"an agreeable manner may set off handsome features, but can never\\nalter plain ones.  however, at any rate, as i have a great deal more\\nat stake on this point than anybody else can have, i think it\\nrather unnecessary in you to be advising me.\"\\n\\nanne had done; glad that it was over, and not absolutely hopeless\\nof doing good.  elizabeth, though resenting the suspicion,\\nmight yet be made observant by it.\\n\\nthe last office of the four carriage-horses was to draw sir walter,\\nmiss elliot, and mrs clay to bath.  the party drove off in very good spirits;\\nsir walter prepared with condescending bows for all the afflicted\\ntenantry and cottagers who might have had a hint to show themselves,\\nand anne walked up at the same time, in a sort of desolate tranquillity,\\nto the lodge, where she was to spend the first week.\\n\\nher friend was not in better spirits than herself. lady russell felt this\\nbreak-up of the family exceedingly.  their respectability was\\nas dear to her as her own, and a daily intercourse had become\\nprecious by habit.  it was painful to look upon their deserted grounds,\\nand still worse to anticipate the new hands they were to fall into;\\nand to escape the solitariness and the melancholy of so altered a village,\\nand be out of the way when admiral and mrs croft first arrived,\\nshe had determined to make her own absence from home begin\\nwhen she must give up anne.  accordingly their removal was made together,\\nand anne was set down at uppercross cottage, in the first stage\\nof lady russell\\'s journey.\\n\\nuppercross was a moderate-sized village, which a few years back\\nhad been completely in the old english style, containing only\\ntwo houses superior in appearance to those of the yeomen and labourers;\\nthe mansion of the squire, with its high walls, great gates, and old trees,\\nsubstantial and unmodernized, and the compact, tight parsonage,\\nenclosed in its own neat garden, with a vine and a pear-tree\\ntrained round its casements; but upon the marriage of the young \\'squire,\\nit had received the improvement of a farm-house elevated into a cottage,\\nfor his residence, and uppercross cottage, with its veranda,\\nfrench windows, and other prettiness, was quite as likely to catch\\nthe traveller\\'s eye as the more consistent and considerable aspect\\nand premises of the great house, about a quarter of a mile farther on.\\n\\nhere anne had often been staying.  she knew the ways of uppercross\\nas well as those of kellynch.  the two families were so continually meeting,\\nso much in the habit of running in and out of each other\\'s house\\nat all hours, that it was rather a surprise to her to find mary alone;\\nbut being alone, her being unwell and out of spirits was almost\\na matter of course.  though better endowed than the elder sister,\\nmary had not anne\\'s understanding nor temper.  while well, and happy,\\nand properly attended to, she had great good humour and excellent spirits;\\nbut any indisposition sunk her completely.  she had no resources\\nfor solitude; and inheriting a considerable share of the elliot\\nself-importance, was very prone to add to every other distress\\nthat of fancying herself neglected and ill-used.  in person, she was\\ninferior to both sisters, and had, even in her bloom, only reached\\nthe dignity of being \"a fine girl.\"  she was now lying on the faded sofa\\nof the pretty little drawing-room, the once elegant furniture of which\\nhad been gradually growing shabby, under the influence of four summers\\nand two children; and, on anne\\'s appearing, greeted her with--\\n\\n\"so, you are come at last!  i began to think i should never see you.\\ni am so ill i can hardly speak.  i have not seen a creature\\nthe whole morning!\"\\n\\n\"i am sorry to find you unwell,\" replied anne.  \"you sent me\\nsuch a good account of yourself on thursday!\"\\n\\n\"yes, i made the best of it; i always do:  but i was very far from well\\nat the time; and i do not think i ever was so ill in my life\\nas i have been all this morning:  very unfit to be left alone, i am sure.\\nsuppose i were to be seized of a sudden in some dreadful way,\\nand not able to ring the bell!  so, lady russell would not get out.\\ni do not think she has been in this house three times this summer.\"\\n\\nanne said what was proper, and enquired after her husband.\\n\"oh! charles is out shooting.  i have not seen him since seven o\\'clock.\\nhe would go, though i told him how ill i was.  he said he should not\\nstay out long; but he has never come back, and now it is almost one.\\ni assure you, i have not seen a soul this whole long morning.\"\\n\\n\"you have had your little boys with you?\"\\n\\n\"yes, as long as i could bear their noise; but they are so unmanageable\\nthat they do me more harm than good.  little charles does not mind\\na word i say, and walter is growing quite as bad.\"\\n\\n\"well, you will soon be better now,\" replied anne, cheerfully.\\n\"you know i always cure you when i come.  how are your neighbours\\nat the great house?\"\\n\\n\"i can give you no account of them.  i have not seen one of them to-day,\\nexcept mr musgrove, who just stopped and spoke through the window,\\nbut without getting off his horse; and though i told him how ill i was,\\nnot one of them have been near me.  it did not happen to suit\\nthe miss musgroves, i suppose, and they never put themselves\\nout of their way.\"\\n\\n\"you will see them yet, perhaps, before the morning is gone.\\nit is early.\"\\n\\n\"i never want them, i assure you.  they talk and laugh a great deal\\ntoo much for me.  oh! anne, i am so very unwell!  it was quite unkind\\nof you not to come on thursday.\"\\n\\n\"my dear mary, recollect what a comfortable account you sent me of yourself!\\nyou wrote in the cheerfullest manner, and said you were perfectly well,\\nand in no hurry for me; and that being the case, you must be aware\\nthat my wish would be to remain with lady russell to the last:\\nand besides what i felt on her account, i have really been so busy,\\nhave had so much to do, that i could not very conveniently have\\nleft kellynch sooner.\"\\n\\n\"dear me! what can you possibly have to do?\"\\n\\n\"a great many things, i assure you.  more than i can recollect\\nin a moment; but i can tell you some.  i have been making\\na duplicate of the catalogue of my father\\'s books and pictures.\\ni have been several times in the garden with mackenzie,\\ntrying to understand, and make him understand, which of elizabeth\\'s plants\\nare for lady russell.  i have had all my own little concerns\\nto arrange, books and music to divide, and all my trunks to repack,\\nfrom not having understood in time what was intended as to the waggons:\\nand one thing i have had to do, mary, of a more trying nature:\\ngoing to almost every house in the parish, as a sort of take-leave.\\ni was told that they wished it.  but all these things took up\\na great deal of time.\"\\n\\n\"oh! well!\" and after a moment\\'s pause, \"but you have never asked me\\none word about our dinner at the pooles yesterday.\"\\n\\n\"did you go then?  i have made no enquiries, because i concluded\\nyou must have been obliged to give up the party.\"\\n\\n\"oh yes! i went.  i was very well yesterday; nothing at all\\nthe matter with me till this morning.  it would have been strange\\nif i had not gone.\"\\n\\n\"i am very glad you were well enough, and i hope you had a pleasant party.\"\\n\\n\"nothing remarkable.  one always knows beforehand what the dinner will be,\\nand who will be there; and it is so very uncomfortable not having\\na carriage of one\\'s own.  mr and mrs musgrove took me, and we were\\nso crowded!  they are both so very large, and take up so much room;\\nand mr musgrove always sits forward.  so, there was i, crowded into\\nthe back seat with henrietta and louise; and i think it very likely\\nthat my illness to-day may be owing to it.\"\\n\\na little further perseverance in patience and forced cheerfulness\\non anne\\'s side produced nearly a cure on mary\\'s.  she could soon\\nsit upright on the sofa, and began to hope she might be able\\nto leave it by dinner-time.  then, forgetting to think of it,\\nshe was at the other end of the room, beautifying a nosegay;\\nthen, she ate her cold meat; and then she was well enough\\nto propose a little walk.\\n\\n\"where shall we go?\" said she, when they were ready.  \"i suppose\\nyou will not like to call at the great house before they have\\nbeen to see you?\"\\n\\n\"i have not the smallest objection on that account,\" replied anne.\\n\"i should never think of standing on such ceremony with people i know\\nso well as mrs and the miss musgroves.\"\\n\\n\"oh! but they ought to call upon you as soon as possible.\\nthey ought to feel what is due to you as my sister.  however,\\nwe may as well go and sit with them a little  while, and when we\\nhave that over, we can enjoy our walk.\"\\n\\nanne had always thought such a style of intercourse highly imprudent;\\nbut she had ceased to endeavour to check it, from believing that,\\nthough there were on each side continual subjects of offence,\\nneither family could now do without it.  to the great house accordingly\\nthey went, to sit the full half hour in the old-fashioned square parlour,\\nwith a small carpet and shining floor, to which the present\\ndaughters of the house were gradually giving the proper air of confusion\\nby a grand piano-forte and a harp, flower-stands and little tables\\nplaced in every direction.  oh! could the originals of the portraits\\nagainst the wainscot, could the gentlemen in brown velvet and\\nthe ladies in blue satin have seen what was going on, have been conscious\\nof such an overthrow of all order and neatness!  the portraits themselves\\nseemed to be staring in astonishment.\\n\\nthe musgroves, like their houses, were in a state of alteration,\\nperhaps of improvement.  the father and mother were in the old\\nenglish style, and the young people in the new.  mr and mrs musgrove\\nwere a very good sort of people; friendly and hospitable,\\nnot much educated, and not at all elegant.  their children had\\nmore modern minds and manners.  there was a numerous family;\\nbut the only two grown up, excepting charles, were henrietta and louisa,\\nyoung ladies of nineteen and twenty, who had brought from school at exeter\\nall the usual stock of accomplishments, and were now like thousands\\nof other young ladies, living to be fashionable, happy, and merry.\\ntheir dress had every advantage, their faces were rather pretty,\\ntheir spirits extremely good, their manner unembarrassed and pleasant;\\nthey were of consequence at home, and favourites abroad.\\nanne always contemplated them as some of the happiest creatures\\nof her acquaintance; but still, saved as we all are, by some\\ncomfortable feeling of superiority from wishing for the possibility\\nof exchange, she would not have given up her own more elegant\\nand cultivated mind for all their enjoyments; and envied them nothing\\nbut that seemingly perfect good understanding and agreement together,\\nthat good-humoured mutual affection, of which she had known\\nso little herself with either of her sisters.\\n\\nthey were received with great cordiality.  nothing seemed amiss\\non the side of the great house family, which was generally,\\nas anne very well knew, the least to blame.  the half hour was\\nchatted away pleasantly enough; and she was not at all surprised\\nat the end of it, to have their walking party joined by both\\nthe miss musgroves, at mary\\'s particular invitation.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 6\\n\\n\\nanne had not wanted this visit to uppercross, to learn that a removal\\nfrom one set of people to another, though at a distance of only three miles,\\nwill often include a total change of conversation, opinion, and idea.\\nshe had never been staying there before, without being struck by it,\\nor without wishing that other elliots could have her advantage\\nin seeing how unknown, or unconsidered there, were the affairs\\nwhich at kellynch hall were treated as of such general publicity\\nand pervading interest; yet, with all this experience, she believed\\nshe must now submit to feel that another lesson, in the art of knowing\\nour own nothingness beyond our own circle, was become necessary for her;\\nfor certainly, coming as she did, with a heart full of the subject\\nwhich had been completely occupying both houses in kellynch for many weeks,\\nshe had expected rather more curiosity and sympathy than she found\\nin the separate but very similar remark of mr and mrs musgrove:\\n\"so, miss anne, sir walter and your sister are gone; and what part of bath\\ndo you think they will settle in?\" and this, without much\\nwaiting for an answer; or in the young ladies\\' addition of,\\n\"i hope we shall be in bath in the winter; but remember, papa,\\nif we do go, we must be in a good situation:  none of your\\nqueen squares for us!\" or in the anxious supplement from mary, of--\\n\"upon my word, i shall be pretty well off, when you are all gone away\\nto be happy at bath!\"\\n\\nshe could only resolve to avoid such self-delusion in future,\\nand think with heightened gratitude of the extraordinary blessing\\nof having one such truly sympathising friend as lady russell.\\n\\nthe mr musgroves had their own game to guard, and to destroy,\\ntheir own horses, dogs, and newspapers to engage them, and the females\\nwere fully occupied in all the other common subjects of housekeeping,\\nneighbours, dress, dancing, and music.  she acknowledged it to be\\nvery fitting, that every little social commonwealth should dictate\\nits own matters of discourse; and hoped, ere long, to become\\na not unworthy member of the one she was now transplanted into.\\nwith the prospect of spending at least two months at uppercross,\\nit was highly incumbent on her to clothe her imagination, her memory,\\nand all her ideas in as much of uppercross as possible.\\n\\nshe had no dread of these two months.  mary was not so repulsive\\nand unsisterly as elizabeth, nor so inaccessible to all influence of hers;\\nneither was there anything among the other component parts\\nof the cottage inimical to comfort.  she was always on friendly terms\\nwith her brother-in-law; and in the children, who loved her nearly as well,\\nand respected her a great deal more than their mother, she had\\nan object of interest, amusement, and wholesome exertion.\\n\\ncharles musgrove was civil and agreeable; in sense and temper he was\\nundoubtedly superior to his wife, but not of powers, or conversation,\\nor grace, to make the past, as they were connected together,\\nat all a dangerous contemplation; though, at the same time,\\nanne could believe, with lady russell, that a more equal match\\nmight have greatly improved him; and that a woman of real understanding\\nmight have given more consequence to his character, and more usefulness,\\nrationality, and elegance to his habits and pursuits.  as it was,\\nhe did nothing with much zeal, but sport; and his time was otherwise\\ntrifled away, without benefit from books or anything else.\\nhe had very good spirits, which never seemed much affected by\\nhis wife\\'s occasional lowness, bore with her unreasonableness\\nsometimes to anne\\'s admiration, and upon the whole, though there was\\nvery often a little disagreement (in which she had sometimes more share\\nthan she wished, being appealed to by both parties), they might pass\\nfor a happy couple.  they were always perfectly agreed in the want\\nof more money, and a strong inclination for a handsome present\\nfrom his father; but here, as on most topics, he had the superiority,\\nfor while mary thought it a great shame that such a present was not made,\\nhe always contended for his father\\'s having many other uses for his money,\\nand a right to spend it as he liked.\\n\\nas to the management of their children, his theory was much better\\nthan his wife\\'s, and his practice not so bad.  \"i could manage them\\nvery well, if it were not for mary\\'s interference,\" was what\\nanne often heard him say, and had a good deal of faith in;\\nbut when listening in turn to mary\\'s reproach of \"charles spoils\\nthe children so that i cannot get them into any order,\" she never had\\nthe smallest temptation to say, \"very true.\"\\n\\none of the least agreeable circumstances of her residence there\\nwas her being treated with too much confidence by all parties,\\nand being too much in the secret of the complaints of each house.\\nknown to have some influence with her sister, she was continually requested,\\nor at least receiving hints to exert it, beyond what was practicable.\\n\"i wish you could persuade mary not to be always fancying herself ill,\"\\nwas charles\\'s language; and, in an unhappy mood, thus spoke mary:\\n\"i do believe if charles were to see me dying, he would not think\\nthere was anything the matter with me.  i am sure, anne, if you would,\\nyou might persuade him that i really am very ill--a great deal worse\\nthan i ever own.\"\\n\\nmary\\'s declaration was, \"i hate sending the children to the great house,\\nthough their grandmamma is always wanting to see them, for she humours\\nand indulges them to such a degree, and gives them so much trash\\nand sweet things, that they are sure to come back sick and cross\\nfor the rest of the day.\"  and mrs musgrove took the first opportunity\\nof being alone with anne, to say, \"oh! miss anne, i cannot help wishing\\nmrs charles had a little of your method with those children.\\nthey are quite different creatures with you!  but to be sure,\\nin general they are so spoilt!  it is a pity you cannot put your sister\\nin the way of managing them.  they are as fine healthy children\\nas ever were seen, poor little dears! without partiality;\\nbut mrs charles knows no more how they should be treated--!\\nbless me! how troublesome they are sometimes.  i assure you, miss anne,\\nit prevents my wishing to see them at our house so often as\\ni otherwise should.  i believe mrs charles is not quite pleased\\nwith my not inviting them oftener; but you know it is very bad\\nto have children with one that one is obligated to be checking\\nevery moment; \"don\\'t do this,\" and \"don\\'t do that;\"  or that one can\\nonly keep in tolerable order by more cake than is good for them.\"\\n\\nshe had this communication, moreover, from mary.  \"mrs musgrove thinks\\nall her servants so steady, that it would be high treason\\nto call it in question; but i am sure, without exaggeration,\\nthat her upper house-maid and laundry-maid, instead of being\\nin their business, are gadding about the village, all day long.\\ni meet them wherever i go; and i declare, i never go twice into my nursery\\nwithout seeing something of them.  if jemima were not the trustiest,\\nsteadiest creature in the world, it would be enough to spoil her;\\nfor she tells me, they are always tempting her to take a walk with them.\"\\nand on mrs musgrove\\'s side, it was, \"i make a rule of never interfering\\nin any of my daughter-in-law\\'s concerns, for i know it would not do;\\nbut i shall tell you, miss anne, because you may be able to set things\\nto rights, that i have no very good opinion of mrs charles\\'s nursery-maid:\\ni hear strange stories of her; she is always upon the gad; and from\\nmy own knowledge, i can declare, she is such a fine-dressing lady,\\nthat she is enough to ruin any servants she comes near.\\nmrs charles quite swears by her, i know; but i just give you this hint,\\nthat you may be upon the watch; because, if you see anything amiss,\\nyou need not be afraid of mentioning it.\"\\n\\nagain, it was mary\\'s complaint, that mrs musgrove was very apt\\nnot to give her the precedence that was her due, when they dined\\nat the great house with other families; and she did not see any reason\\nwhy she was to be considered so much at home as to lose her place.\\nand one day when anne was walking with only the musgroves, one of them\\nafter talking of rank, people of rank, and jealousy of rank, said,\\n\"i have no scruple of observing to you, how nonsensical some persons are\\nabout their place, because all the world knows how easy and indifferent\\nyou are about it; but i wish anybody could give mary a hint that\\nit would be a great deal better if she were not so very tenacious,\\nespecially if she would not be always putting herself forward to take\\nplace of mamma.  nobody doubts her right to have precedence of mamma,\\nbut it would be more becoming in her not to be always insisting on it.\\nit is not that mamma cares about it the least in the world,\\nbut i know it is taken notice of by many persons.\"\\n\\nhow was anne to set all these matters to rights?  she could do little more\\nthan listen patiently, soften every grievance, and excuse each\\nto the other; give them all hints of the forbearance necessary\\nbetween such near neighbours, and make those hints broadest\\nwhich were meant for her sister\\'s benefit.\\n\\nin all other respects, her visit began and proceeded very well.\\nher own spirits improved by change of place and subject,\\nby being removed three miles from kellynch; mary\\'s ailments lessened\\nby having a constant companion, and their daily intercourse\\nwith the other family, since there was neither superior affection,\\nconfidence, nor employment in the cottage, to be interrupted by it,\\nwas rather an advantage.  it was certainly carried nearly as far as possible,\\nfor they met every morning, and hardly ever spent an evening asunder;\\nbut she believed they should not have done so well without the sight\\nof mr and mrs musgrove\\'s respectable forms in the usual places,\\nor without the talking, laughing, and singing of their daughters.\\n\\nshe played a great deal better than either of the miss musgroves,\\nbut having no voice, no knowledge of the harp, and no fond parents,\\nto sit by and fancy themselves delighted, her performance was\\nlittle thought of, only out of civility, or to refresh the others,\\nas she was well aware.  she knew that when she played she was\\ngiving pleasure only to herself; but this was no new sensation.\\nexcepting one short period of her life, she had never, since the age\\nof fourteen, never since the loss of her dear mother, known the happiness\\nof being listened to, or encouraged by any just appreciation or real taste.\\nin music she had been always used to feel alone in the world;\\nand mr and mrs musgrove\\'s fond partiality for their own daughters\\'\\nperformance, and total indifference to any other person\\'s,\\ngave her much more pleasure for their sakes, than mortification\\nfor her own.\\n\\nthe party at the great house was sometimes increased by other company.\\nthe neighbourhood was not large, but the musgroves were visited\\nby everybody, and had more dinner-parties, and more callers,\\nmore visitors by invitation and by chance, than any other family.\\nthere were more completely popular.\\n\\nthe girls were wild for dancing; and the evenings ended, occasionally,\\nin an unpremeditated little ball.  there was a family of cousins\\nwithin a walk of uppercross, in less affluent circumstances,\\nwho depended on the musgroves for all their pleasures:  they would come\\nat any time, and help play at anything, or dance anywhere; and anne,\\nvery much preferring the office of musician to a more active post,\\nplayed country dances to them by the hour together; a kindness which\\nalways recommended her musical powers to the notice of mr and mrs musgrove\\nmore than anything else, and often drew this compliment;--\\n\"well done, miss anne! very well done indeed!  lord bless me!\\nhow those little fingers of yours fly about!\"\\n\\nso passed the first three weeks.  michaelmas came; and now anne\\'s heart\\nmust be in kellynch again.  a beloved home made over to others;\\nall the precious rooms and furniture, groves, and prospects,\\nbeginning to own other eyes and other limbs!  she could not\\nthink of much else on the 29th of september; and she had this\\nsympathetic touch in the evening from mary, who, on having occasion\\nto note down the day of the month, exclaimed, \"dear me, is not this\\nthe day the crofts were to come to kellynch?  i am glad i did not\\nthink of it before.  how low it makes me!\"\\n\\nthe crofts took possession with true naval alertness, and were\\nto be visited.  mary deplored the necessity for herself.\\n\"nobody knew how much she should suffer.  she should put it off\\nas long as she could;\" but was not easy till she had talked charles\\ninto driving her over on an early day, and was in a very animated,\\ncomfortable state of imaginary agitation, when she came back.\\nanne had very sincerely rejoiced in there being no means of her going.\\nshe wished, however to see the crofts, and was glad to be within\\nwhen the visit was returned.  they came:  the master of the house\\nwas not at home, but the two sisters were together; and as it chanced\\nthat mrs croft fell to the share of anne, while the admiral sat by mary,\\nand made himself very agreeable by his good-humoured notice\\nof her little boys, she was well able to watch for a likeness,\\nand if it failed her in the features, to catch it in the voice,\\nor in the turn of sentiment and expression.\\n\\nmrs croft, though neither tall nor fat, had a squareness,\\nuprightness, and vigour of form, which gave importance to her person.\\nshe had bright dark eyes, good teeth, and altogether an agreeable face;\\nthough her reddened and weather-beaten complexion, the consequence\\nof her having been almost as much at sea as her husband, made her seem to\\nhave lived some years longer in the world than her real eight-and-thirty.\\nher manners were open, easy, and decided, like one who had\\nno distrust of herself, and no doubts of what to do; without any\\napproach to coarseness, however, or any want of good humour.\\nanne gave her credit, indeed, for feelings of great consideration\\ntowards herself, in all that related to kellynch, and it pleased her:\\nespecially, as she had satisfied herself in the very first half minute,\\nin the instant even of introduction, that there was not the smallest\\nsymptom of any knowledge or suspicion on mrs croft\\'s side, to give a bias\\nof any sort.  she was quite easy on that head, and consequently\\nfull of strength and courage, till for a moment electrified by\\nmrs croft\\'s suddenly saying,--\\n\\n\"it was you, and not your sister, i find, that my brother had\\nthe pleasure of being acquainted with, when he was in this country.\"\\n\\nanne hoped she had outlived the age of blushing; but the age of emotion\\nshe certainly had not.\\n\\n\"perhaps you may not have heard that he is married?\" added mrs croft.\\n\\nshe could now answer as she ought; and was happy to feel,\\nwhen mrs croft\\'s next words explained it to be mr wentworth\\nof whom she spoke, that she had said nothing which might not do\\nfor either brother. she immediately felt how reasonable it was,\\nthat mrs croft should be thinking and speaking of edward,\\nand not of frederick; and with shame at her own forgetfulness\\napplied herself to the knowledge of their former neighbour\\'s\\npresent state with proper interest.\\n\\nthe rest was all tranquillity; till, just as they were moving,\\nshe heard the admiral say to mary--\\n\\n\"we are expecting a brother of mrs croft\\'s here soon; i dare say\\nyou know him by name.\"\\n\\nhe was cut short by the eager attacks of the little boys,\\nclinging to him like an old friend, and declaring he should not go;\\nand being too much engrossed by proposals of carrying them away\\nin his coat pockets, &c., to have another moment for finishing\\nor recollecting what he had begun, anne was left to persuade herself,\\nas well as she could, that the same brother must still be in question.\\nshe could not, however, reach such a degree of certainty,\\nas not to be anxious to hear whether anything had been said on the subject\\nat the other house, where the crofts had previously been calling.\\n\\nthe folks of the great house were to spend the evening of this day\\nat the cottage; and it being now too late in the year for such visits\\nto be made on foot, the coach was beginning to be listened for,\\nwhen the youngest miss musgrove walked in.  that she was coming\\nto apologize, and that they should have to spend the evening by themselves,\\nwas the first black idea; and mary was quite ready to be affronted,\\nwhen louisa made all right by saying, that she only came on foot,\\nto leave more room for the harp, which was bringing in the carriage.\\n\\n\"and i will tell you our reason,\" she added, \"and all about it.\\ni am come on to give you notice, that papa and mamma are\\nout of spirits this evening, especially mamma; she is thinking so much\\nof poor richard!  and we agreed it would be best to have the harp,\\nfor it seems to amuse her more than the piano-forte.  i will tell you\\nwhy she is out of spirits.  when the crofts called this morning,\\n(they called here afterwards, did not they?), they happened to say,\\nthat her brother, captain wentworth, is just returned to england,\\nor paid off, or something, and is coming to see them almost directly;\\nand most unluckily it came into mamma\\'s head, when they were gone,\\nthat wentworth, or something very like it, was the name of\\npoor richard\\'s captain at one time; i do not know when or where,\\nbut a great while before he died, poor fellow!  and upon looking over\\nhis letters and things, she found it was so, and is perfectly sure\\nthat this must be the very man, and her head is quite full of it,\\nand of poor richard!  so we must be as merry as we can, that she may not\\nbe dwelling upon such gloomy things.\"\\n\\nthe real circumstances of this pathetic piece of family history were,\\nthat the musgroves had had the ill fortune of a very troublesome,\\nhopeless son; and the good fortune to lose him before he reached\\nhis twentieth year; that he had been sent to sea because he was stupid\\nand unmanageable on shore; that he had been very little cared for\\nat any time by his family, though quite as much as he deserved;\\nseldom heard of, and scarcely at all regretted, when the intelligence\\nof his death abroad had worked its way to uppercross, two years before.\\n\\nhe had, in fact, though his sisters were now doing all they could for him,\\nby calling him \"poor richard,\" been nothing better than a thick-headed,\\nunfeeling, unprofitable dick musgrove, who had never done anything\\nto entitle himself to more than the abbreviation of his name,\\nliving or dead.\\n\\nhe had been several years at sea, and had, in the course of those removals\\nto which all midshipmen are liable, and especially such midshipmen\\nas every captain wishes to get rid of, been six months on board\\ncaptain frederick wentworth\\'s frigate, the laconia; and from the laconia\\nhe had, under the influence of his captain, written the only two letters\\nwhich his father and mother had ever received from him during the whole\\nof his absence; that is to say, the only two disinterested letters;\\nall the rest had been mere applications for money.\\n\\nin each letter he had spoken well of his captain; but yet,\\nso little were they in the habit of attending to such matters,\\nso unobservant and incurious were they as to the names of men or ships,\\nthat it had made scarcely any impression at the time; and that mrs musgrove\\nshould have been suddenly struck, this very day, with a recollection\\nof the name of wentworth, as connected with her son, seemed one of those\\nextraordinary bursts of mind which do sometimes occur.\\n\\nshe had gone to her letters, and found it all as she supposed;\\nand the re-perusal of these letters, after so long an interval,\\nher poor son gone for ever, and all the strength of his faults forgotten,\\nhad affected her spirits exceedingly, and thrown her into\\ngreater grief for him than she had know on first hearing of his death.\\nmr musgrove was, in a lesser degree, affected likewise; and when\\nthey reached the cottage, they were evidently in want, first,\\nof being listened to anew on this subject, and afterwards,\\nof all the relief which cheerful companions could give them.\\n\\nto hear them talking so much of captain wentworth, repeating his name\\nso often, puzzling over past years, and at last ascertaining that it might,\\nthat it probably would, turn out to be the very same captain wentworth\\nwhom they recollected meeting, once or twice, after their coming back\\nfrom clifton--a very fine young man--but they could not say whether\\nit was seven or eight years ago, was a new sort of trial to anne\\'s nerves.\\nshe found, however, that it was one to which she must inure herself.\\nsince he actually was expected in the country, she must teach herself\\nto be insensible on such points.  and not only did it appear that\\nhe was expected, and speedily, but the musgroves, in their warm gratitude\\nfor the kindness he had shewn poor dick, and very high respect\\nfor his character, stamped as it was by poor dick\\'s having been\\nsix months under his care, and mentioning him in strong,\\nthough not perfectly well-spelt praise, as \"a fine dashing felow,\\nonly two perticular about the schoolmaster,\" were bent on\\nintroducing themselves, and seeking his acquaintance, as soon as\\nthey could hear of his arrival.\\n\\nthe resolution of doing so helped to form the comfort of their evening.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 7\\n\\n\\na very few days more, and captain wentworth was known to be at kellynch,\\nand mr musgrove had called on him, and come back warm in his praise,\\nand he was engaged with the crofts to dine at uppercross,\\nby the end of another week.  it had been a great disappointment\\nto mr musgrove to find that no earlier day could be fixed,\\nso impatient was he to shew his gratitude, by seeing captain wentworth\\nunder his own roof, and welcoming him to all that was strongest\\nand best in his cellars.  but a week must pass; only a week,\\nin anne\\'s reckoning, and then, she supposed, they must meet;\\nand soon she began to wish that she could feel secure even for a week.\\n\\ncaptain wentworth made a very early return to mr musgrove\\'s civility,\\nand she was all but calling there in the same half hour.\\nshe and mary were actually setting forward for the great house,\\nwhere, as she afterwards learnt, they must inevitably have found him,\\nwhen they were stopped by the eldest boy\\'s being at that moment\\nbrought home in consequence of a bad fall.  the child\\'s situation\\nput the visit entirely aside; but she could not hear of her escape\\nwith indifference, even in the midst of the serious anxiety\\nwhich they afterwards felt on his account.\\n\\nhis collar-bone was found to be dislocated, and such injury\\nreceived in the back, as roused the most alarming ideas.\\nit was an afternoon of distress, and anne had every thing to do at once;\\nthe apothecary to send for, the father to have pursued and informed,\\nthe mother to support and keep from hysterics, the servants to control,\\nthe youngest child to banish, and the poor suffering one to attend\\nand soothe; besides sending, as soon as she recollected it,\\nproper notice to the other house, which brought her an accession\\nrather of frightened, enquiring companions, than of very useful assistants.\\n\\nher brother\\'s return was the first comfort; he could take best care\\nof his wife; and the second blessing was the arrival of the apothecary.\\ntill he came and had examined the child, their apprehensions were\\nthe worse for being vague; they suspected great injury, but knew not where;\\nbut now the collar-bone was soon replaced, and though mr robinson\\nfelt and felt, and rubbed, and looked grave, and spoke low words\\nboth to the father and the aunt, still they were all to hope the best,\\nand to be able to part and eat their dinner in tolerable ease of mind;\\nand then it was, just before they parted, that the two young aunts\\nwere able so far to digress from their nephew\\'s state, as to give\\nthe information of captain wentworth\\'s visit; staying five minutes behind\\ntheir father and mother, to endeavour to express how perfectly delighted\\nthey were with him, how much handsomer, how infinitely more agreeable\\nthey thought him than any individual among their male acquaintance,\\nwho had been at all a favourite before.  how glad they had been\\nto hear papa invite him to stay dinner, how sorry when he said\\nit was quite out of his power, and how glad again when he had promised\\nin reply to papa and mamma\\'s farther pressing invitations to come\\nand dine with them on the morrow--actually on the morrow;\\nand he had promised it in so pleasant a manner, as if he felt\\nall the motive of their attention just as he ought.  and in short,\\nhe had looked and said everything with such exquisite grace,\\nthat they could assure them all, their heads were both turned by him;\\nand off they ran, quite as full of glee as of love, and apparently\\nmore full of captain wentworth than of little charles.\\n\\nthe same story and the same raptures were repeated, when the two girls came\\nwith their father, through the gloom of the evening, to make enquiries;\\nand mr musgrove, no longer under the first uneasiness about his heir,\\ncould add his confirmation and praise, and hope there would be now\\nno occasion for putting captain wentworth off, and only be sorry to think\\nthat the cottage party, probably, would not like to leave the little boy,\\nto give him the meeting.  \"oh no; as to leaving the little boy,\"\\nboth father and mother were in much too strong and recent alarm\\nto bear the thought; and anne, in the joy of the escape,\\ncould not help adding her warm protestations to theirs.\\n\\ncharles musgrove, indeed, afterwards, shewed more of inclination;\\n\"the child was going on so well, and he wished so much to be introduced\\nto captain wentworth, that, perhaps, he might join them in the evening;\\nhe would not dine from home, but he might walk in for half an hour.\"\\nbut in this he was eagerly opposed by his wife, with \"oh! no, indeed,\\ncharles, i cannot bear to have you go away.  only think if anything\\nshould happen?\"\\n\\nthe child had a good night, and was going on well the next day.\\nit must be a work of time to ascertain that no injury had been\\ndone to the spine; but mr robinson found nothing to increase alarm,\\nand charles musgrove began, consequently, to feel no necessity\\nfor longer confinement.  the child was to be kept in bed and amused\\nas quietly as possible; but what was there for a father to do?\\nthis was quite a female case, and it would be highly absurd in him,\\nwho could be of no use at home, to shut himself up.  his father\\nvery much wished him to meet captain wentworth, and there being\\nno sufficient reason against it, he ought to go; and it ended in his\\nmaking a bold, public declaration, when he came in from shooting,\\nof his meaning to dress directly, and dine at the other house.\\n\\n\"nothing can be going on better than the child,\" said he;\\n\"so i told my father, just now, that i would come, and he thought me\\nquite right.  your sister being with you, my love, i have no scruple at all.\\nyou would not like to leave him yourself, but you see i can be of no use.\\nanne will send for me if anything is the matter.\"\\n\\nhusbands and wives generally understand when opposition will be vain.\\nmary knew, from charles\\'s manner of speaking, that he was\\nquite determined on going, and that it would be of no use to teaze him.\\nshe said nothing, therefore, till he was out of the room,\\nbut as soon as there was only anne to hear--\\n\\n\"so you and i are to be left to shift by ourselves, with this\\npoor sick child; and not a creature coming near us all the evening!\\ni knew how it would be.  this is always my luck.  if there is\\nanything disagreeable going on men are always sure to get out of it,\\nand charles is as bad as any of them.  very unfeeling!  i must say\\nit is very unfeeling of him to be running away from his poor little boy.\\ntalks of his being going on so well!  how does he know that he is\\ngoing on well, or that there may not be a sudden change half an hour hence?\\ni did not think charles would have been so unfeeling.  so here he is to\\ngo away and enjoy himself, and because i am the poor mother,\\ni am not to be allowed to stir; and yet, i am sure, i am more unfit\\nthan anybody else to be about the child.  my being the mother\\nis the very reason why my feelings should not be tried.  i am not at all\\nequal to it.  you saw how hysterical i was yesterday.\"\\n\\n\"but that was only the effect of the suddenness of your alarm--\\nof the shock.  you will not be hysterical again.  i dare say we shall have\\nnothing to distress us.  i perfectly understand mr robinson\\'s directions,\\nand have no fears; and indeed, mary, i cannot wonder at your husband.\\nnursing does not belong to a man; it is not his province.\\na sick child is always the mother\\'s property:  her own feelings\\ngenerally make it so.\"\\n\\n\"i hope i am as fond of my child as any mother, but i do not know\\nthat i am of any more use in the sick-room than charles,\\nfor i cannot be always scolding and teazing the poor child when it is ill;\\nand you saw, this morning, that if i told him to keep quiet,\\nhe was sure to begin kicking about.  i have not nerves\\nfor the sort of thing.\"\\n\\n\"but, could you be comfortable yourself, to be spending\\nthe whole evening away from the poor boy?\"\\n\\n\"yes; you see his papa can, and why should not i?  jemima is so careful;\\nand she could send us word every hour how he was.  i really think\\ncharles might as well have told his father we would all come.\\ni am not more alarmed about little charles now than he is.\\ni was dreadfully alarmed yesterday, but the case is very different to-day.\"\\n\\n\"well, if you do not think it too late to give notice for yourself,\\nsuppose you were to go, as well as your husband.  leave little charles\\nto my care.  mr and mrs musgrove cannot think it wrong while i remain\\nwith him.\"\\n\\n\"are you serious?\" cried mary, her eyes brightening.  \"dear me!\\nthat\\'s a very good thought, very good, indeed.  to be sure,\\ni may just as well go as not, for i am of no use at home--am i?\\nand it only harasses me.  you, who have not a mother\\'s feelings,\\nare a great deal the properest person.  you can make little charles\\ndo anything; he always minds you at a word.  it will be a great deal better\\nthan leaving him only with jemima.  oh! i shall certainly go;\\ni am sure i ought if i can, quite as much as charles, for they want me\\nexcessively to be acquainted with captain wentworth, and i know\\nyou do not mind being left alone.  an excellent thought of yours,\\nindeed, anne.  i will go and tell charles, and get ready directly.\\nyou can send for us, you know, at a moment\\'s notice, if anything\\nis the matter; but i dare say there will be nothing to alarm you.\\ni should not go, you may be sure, if i did not feel quite at ease\\nabout my dear child.\"\\n\\nthe next moment she was tapping at her husband\\'s dressing-room door,\\nand as anne followed her up stairs, she was in time for\\nthe whole conversation, which began with mary\\'s saying,\\nin a tone of great exultation--\\n\\n\"i mean to go with you, charles, for i am of no more use at home\\nthan you are.  if i were to shut myself up for ever with the child,\\ni should not be able to persuade him to do anything he did not like.\\nanne will stay; anne undertakes to stay at home and take care of him.\\nit is anne\\'s own proposal, and so i shall go with you, which will be\\na great deal better, for i have not dined at the other house since tuesday.\"\\n\\n\"this is very kind of anne,\" was her husband\\'s answer, \"and i should be\\nvery glad to have you go; but it seems rather hard that she should be\\nleft at home by herself, to nurse our sick child.\"\\n\\nanne was now at hand to take up her own cause, and the sincerity\\nof her manner being soon sufficient to convince him, where conviction\\nwas at least very agreeable, he had no farther scruples as to her being\\nleft to dine alone, though he still wanted her to join them in the evening,\\nwhen the child might be at rest for the night, and kindly urged her\\nto let him come and fetch her, but she was quite unpersuadable;\\nand this being the case, she had ere long the pleasure of seeing them\\nset off together in high spirits.  they were gone, she hoped,\\nto be happy, however oddly constructed such happiness might seem;\\nas for herself, she was left with as many sensations of comfort,\\nas were, perhaps, ever likely to be hers.  she knew herself to be\\nof the first utility to the child; and what was it to her\\nif frederick wentworth were only half a mile distant, making himself\\nagreeable to others?\\n\\nshe would have liked to know how he felt as to a meeting.\\nperhaps indifferent, if indifference could exist under such circumstances.\\nhe must be either indifferent or unwilling.  had he wished\\never to see her again, he need not have waited till this time;\\nhe would have done what she could not but believe that in his place\\nshe should have done long ago, when events had been early giving him\\nthe independence which alone had been wanting.\\n\\nher brother and sister came back delighted with their new acquaintance,\\nand their visit in general.  there had been music, singing,\\ntalking, laughing, all that was most agreeable; charming manners\\nin captain wentworth, no shyness or reserve; they seemed all\\nto know each other perfectly, and he was coming the very next morning\\nto shoot with charles.  he was to come to breakfast, but not at the cottage,\\nthough that had been proposed at first; but then he had been pressed\\nto come to the great house instead, and he seemed afraid of being\\nin mrs charles musgrove\\'s way, on account of the child, and therefore,\\nsomehow, they hardly knew how, it ended in charles\\'s being to meet him\\nto breakfast at his father\\'s.\\n\\nanne understood it.  he wished to avoid seeing her.  he had inquired\\nafter her, she found, slightly, as might suit a former slight acquaintance,\\nseeming to acknowledge such as she had acknowledged, actuated, perhaps,\\nby the same view of escaping introduction when they were to meet.\\n\\nthe morning hours of the cottage were always later than those\\nof the other house, and on the morrow the difference was so great\\nthat mary and anne were not more than beginning breakfast when\\ncharles came in to say that they were just setting off, that he was\\ncome for his dogs, that his sisters were following with captain wentworth;\\nhis sisters meaning to visit mary and the child, and captain wentworth\\nproposing also to wait on her for a few minutes if not inconvenient;\\nand though charles had answered for the child\\'s being in no such state\\nas could make it inconvenient, captain wentworth would not be satisfied\\nwithout his running on to give notice.\\n\\nmary, very much gratified by this attention, was delighted to receive him,\\nwhile a thousand feelings rushed on anne, of which this was\\nthe most consoling, that it would soon be over.  and it was soon over.\\nin two minutes after charles\\'s preparation, the others appeared;\\nthey were in the drawing-room.  her eye half met captain wentworth\\'s,\\na bow, a curtsey passed; she heard his voice; he talked to mary,\\nsaid all that was right, said something to the miss musgroves,\\nenough to mark an easy footing; the room seemed full, full of persons\\nand voices, but a few minutes ended it.  charles shewed himself\\nat the window, all was ready, their visitor had bowed and was gone,\\nthe miss musgroves were gone too, suddenly resolving to walk\\nto the end of the village with the sportsmen:  the room was cleared,\\nand anne might finish her breakfast as she could.\\n\\n\"it is over! it is over!\" she repeated to herself again and again,\\nin nervous gratitude.  \"the worst is over!\"\\n\\nmary talked, but she could not attend.  she had seen him.\\nthey had met.  they had been once more in the same room.\\n\\nsoon, however, she began to reason with herself, and try to be feeling less.\\neight years, almost eight years had passed, since all had been given up.\\nhow absurd to be resuming the agitation which such an interval\\nhad banished into distance and indistinctness!  what might not\\neight years do?  events of every description, changes, alienations,\\nremovals--all, all must be comprised in it, and oblivion of the past--\\nhow natural, how certain too!  it included nearly a third part\\nof her own life.\\n\\nalas! with all her reasoning, she found, that to retentive feelings\\neight years may be little more than nothing.\\n\\nnow, how were his sentiments to be read?  was this like\\nwishing to avoid her?  and the next moment she was hating herself\\nfor the folly which asked the question.\\n\\non one other question which perhaps her utmost wisdom\\nmight not have prevented, she was soon spared all suspense;\\nfor, after the miss musgroves had returned and finished their visit\\nat the cottage she had this spontaneous information from mary: --\\n\\n\"captain wentworth is not very gallant by you, anne, though he was\\nso attentive to me.  henrietta asked him what he thought of you,\\nwhen they went away, and he said, `you were so altered he should not\\nhave known you again.\\'\"\\n\\nmary had no feelings to make her respect her sister\\'s in a common way,\\nbut she was perfectly unsuspicious of being inflicting any peculiar wound.\\n\\n\"altered beyond his knowledge.\"  anne fully submitted, in silent,\\ndeep mortification.  doubtless it was so, and she could take no revenge,\\nfor he was not altered, or not for the worse.  she had already\\nacknowledged it to herself, and she could not think differently,\\nlet him think of her as he would.  no:  the years which had destroyed\\nher youth and bloom had only given him a more glowing, manly,\\nopen look, in no respect lessening his personal advantages.\\nshe had seen the same frederick wentworth.\\n\\n\"so altered that he should not have known her again!\"  these were words\\nwhich could not but dwell with her.  yet she soon began to rejoice\\nthat she had heard them.  they were of sobering tendency;\\nthey allayed agitation; they composed, and consequently must\\nmake her happier.\\n\\nfrederick wentworth had used such words, or something like them,\\nbut without an idea that they would be carried round to her.\\nhe had thought her wretchedly altered, and in the first moment of appeal,\\nhad spoken as he felt.  he had not forgiven anne elliot.\\nshe had used him ill, deserted and disappointed him; and worse,\\nshe had shewn a feebleness of character in doing so, which his own decided,\\nconfident temper could not endure.  she had given him up to oblige others.\\nit had been the effect of over-persuasion.  it had been\\nweakness and timidity.\\n\\nhe had been most warmly attached to her, and had never seen a woman since\\nwhom he thought her equal; but, except from some natural sensation\\nof curiosity, he had no desire of meeting her again.  her power with him\\nwas gone for ever.\\n\\nit was now his object to marry.  he was rich, and being turned on shore,\\nfully intended to settle as soon as he could be properly tempted;\\nactually looking round, ready to fall in love with all the speed\\nwhich a clear head and a quick taste could allow.  he had a heart\\nfor either of the miss musgroves, if they could catch it; a heart,\\nin short, for any pleasing young woman who came in his way,\\nexcepting anne elliot.  this was his only secret exception,\\nwhen he said to his sister, in answer to her suppositions:--\\n\\n\"yes, here i am, sophia, quite ready to make a foolish match.\\nanybody between fifteen and thirty may have me for asking.\\na little beauty, and a few smiles, and a few compliments to the navy,\\nand i am a lost man.  should not this be enough for a sailor,\\nwho has had no society among women to make him nice?\"\\n\\nhe said it, she knew, to be contradicted.  his bright proud eye\\nspoke the conviction that he was nice; and anne elliot was\\nnot out of his thoughts, when he more seriously described\\nthe woman he should wish to meet with.  \"a strong mind,\\nwith sweetness of manner,\" made the first and the last of the description.\\n\\n\"that is the woman i want,\" said he.  \"something a little inferior\\ni shall of course put up with, but it must not be much.  if i am a fool,\\ni shall be a fool indeed, for i have thought on the subject\\nmore than most men.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 8\\n\\n\\nfrom this time captain wentworth and anne elliot were repeatedly\\nin the same circle.  they were soon dining in company together\\nat mr musgrove\\'s, for the little boy\\'s state could no longer\\nsupply his aunt with a pretence for absenting herself; and this was\\nbut the beginning of other dinings and other meetings.\\n\\nwhether former feelings were to be renewed must be brought to the proof;\\nformer times must undoubtedly be brought to the recollection of each;\\nthey could not but be reverted to; the year of their engagement\\ncould not but be named by him, in the little narratives or descriptions\\nwhich conversation called forth.  his profession qualified him,\\nhis disposition lead him, to talk; and \"that was in the year six;\"\\n\"that happened before i went to sea in the year six,\" occurred\\nin the course of the first evening they spent together:\\nand though his voice did not falter, and though she had no reason\\nto suppose his eye wandering towards her while he spoke,\\nanne felt the utter impossibility, from her knowledge of his mind,\\nthat he could be unvisited by remembrance any more than herself.\\nthere must be the same immediate association of thought,\\nthough she was very far from conceiving it to be of equal pain.\\n\\nthey had no conversation together, no intercourse but what\\nthe commonest civility required.  once so much to each other!\\nnow nothing!  there had been a time, when of all the large party\\nnow filling the drawing-room at uppercross, they would have found it\\nmost difficult to cease to speak to one another.  with the exception,\\nperhaps, of admiral and mrs croft, who seemed particularly attached\\nand happy, (anne could allow no other exceptions even among\\nthe married couples), there could have been no two hearts so open,\\nno tastes so similar, no feelings so in unison, no countenances so beloved.\\nnow they were as strangers; nay, worse than strangers, for they could\\nnever become acquainted.  it was a perpetual estrangement.\\n\\nwhen he talked, she heard the same voice, and discerned the same mind.\\nthere was a very general ignorance of all naval matters throughout the party;\\nand he was very much questioned, and especially by the two miss musgroves,\\nwho seemed hardly to have any eyes but for him, as to the manner\\nof living on board, daily regulations, food, hours, &c., and their surprise\\nat his accounts, at learning the degree of accommodation and arrangement\\nwhich was practicable, drew from him some pleasant ridicule,\\nwhich reminded anne of the early days when she too had been ignorant,\\nand she too had been accused of supposing sailors to be living on board\\nwithout anything to eat, or any cook to dress it if there were,\\nor any servant to wait, or any knife and fork to use.\\n\\nfrom thus listening and thinking, she was roused by a whisper\\nof mrs musgrove\\'s who, overcome by fond regrets, could not help saying--\\n\\n\"ah! miss anne, if it had pleased heaven to spare my poor son,\\ni dare say he would have been just such another by this time.\"\\n\\nanne suppressed a smile, and listened kindly, while mrs musgrove\\nrelieved her heart a little more; and for a few minutes, therefore,\\ncould not keep pace with the conversation of the others.\\n\\nwhen she could let her attention take its natural course again,\\nshe found the miss musgroves just fetching the navy list\\n(their own navy list, the first that had ever been at uppercross),\\nand sitting down together to pore over it, with the professed view\\nof finding out the ships that captain wentworth had commanded.\\n\\n\"your first was the asp, i remember; we will look for the asp.\"\\n\\n\"you will not find her there.  quite worn out and broken up.\\ni was the last man who commanded her.  hardly fit for service then.\\nreported fit for home service for a year or two, and so i was sent off\\nto the west indies.\"\\n\\nthe girls looked all amazement.\\n\\n\"the admiralty,\" he continued, \"entertain themselves now and then,\\nwith sending a few hundred men to sea, in a ship not fit to be employed.\\nbut they have a great many to provide for; and among the thousands\\nthat may just as well go to the bottom as not, it is impossible\\nfor them to distinguish the very set who may be least missed.\"\\n\\n\"phoo! phoo!\" cried the admiral, \"what stuff these young fellows talk!\\nnever was a better sloop than the asp in her day.  for an old built sloop,\\nyou would not see her equal.  lucky fellow to get her!  he knows there\\nmust have been twenty better men than himself applying for her\\nat the same time.  lucky fellow to get anything so soon,\\nwith no more interest than his.\"\\n\\n\"i felt my luck, admiral, i assure you;\" replied captain wentworth,\\nseriously.  \"i was as well satisfied with my appointment as you can desire.\\nit was a great object with me at that time to be at sea;\\na very great object, i wanted to be doing something.\"\\n\\n\"to be sure you did.  what should a young fellow like you do ashore\\nfor half a year together?  if a man had not a wife, he soon wants\\nto be afloat again.\"\\n\\n\"but, captain wentworth,\" cried louisa, \"how vexed you must have been\\nwhen you came to the asp, to see what an old thing they had given you.\"\\n\\n\"i knew pretty well what she was before that day;\" said he, smiling.\\n\"i had no more discoveries to make than you would have as to\\nthe fashion and strength of any old pelisse, which you had seen\\nlent about among half your acquaintance ever since you could remember,\\nand which at last, on some very wet day, is lent to yourself.\\nah! she was a dear old asp to me.  she did all that i wanted.\\ni knew she would.  i knew that we should either go to the bottom together,\\nor that she would be the making of me; and i never had two days\\nof foul weather all the time i was at sea in her; and after\\ntaking privateers enough to be very entertaining, i had the good luck\\nin my passage home the next autumn, to fall in with the very french frigate\\ni wanted.  i brought her into plymouth; and here another instance of luck.\\nwe had not been six hours in the sound, when a gale came on,\\nwhich lasted four days and nights, and which would have done for\\npoor old asp in half the time; our touch with the great nation\\nnot having much improved our condition.  four-and-twenty hours later,\\nand i should only have been a gallant captain wentworth,\\nin a small paragraph at one corner of the newspapers; and being lost\\nin only a sloop, nobody would have thought about me.\" anne\\'s shudderings\\nwere to herself alone; but the miss musgroves could be as open\\nas they were sincere, in their exclamations of pity and horror.\\n\\n\"and so then, i suppose,\" said mrs musgrove, in a low voice,\\nas if thinking aloud, \"so then he went away to the laconia, and there\\nhe met with our poor boy. charles, my dear,\" (beckoning him to her),\\n\"do ask captain wentworth where it was he first met with your poor brother.\\ni always forgot.\"\\n\\n\"it was at gibraltar, mother, i know.  dick had been left ill at gibraltar,\\nwith a recommendation from his former captain to captain wentworth.\"\\n\\n\"oh! but, charles, tell captain wentworth, he need not be afraid\\nof mentioning poor dick before me, for it would be rather a pleasure\\nto hear him talked of by such a good friend.\"\\n\\ncharles, being somewhat more mindful of the probabilities of the case,\\nonly nodded in reply, and walked away.\\n\\nthe girls were now hunting for the laconia; and captain wentworth\\ncould not deny himself the pleasure of taking the precious volume\\ninto his own hands to save them the trouble, and once more read aloud\\nthe little statement of her name and rate, and present\\nnon-commissioned class, observing over it that she too had been\\none of the best friends man ever had.\\n\\n\"ah! those were pleasant days when i had the laconia!  how fast i\\nmade money in her.  a friend of mine and i had such a lovely cruise\\ntogether off the western islands.  poor harville, sister!\\nyou know how much he wanted money:  worse than myself.  he had a wife.\\nexcellent fellow.  i shall never forget his happiness.  he felt it all,\\nso much for her sake.  i wished for him again the next summer,\\nwhen i had still the same luck in the mediterranean.\"\\n\\n\"and i am sure, sir.\" said mrs musgrove, \"it was a lucky day for us,\\nwhen you were put captain into that ship.  we shall never forget\\nwhat you did.\"\\n\\nher feelings made her speak low; and captain wentworth,\\nhearing only in part, and probably not having dick musgrove at all\\nnear his thoughts, looked rather in suspense, and as if waiting for more.\\n\\n\"my brother,\" whispered one of the girls; \"mamma is thinking\\nof poor richard.\"\\n\\n\"poor dear fellow!\" continued mrs musgrove; \"he was grown so steady,\\nand such an excellent correspondent, while he was under your care!\\nah! it would have been a happy thing, if he had never left you.\\ni assure you, captain wentworth, we are very sorry he ever left you.\"\\n\\nthere was a momentary expression in captain wentworth\\'s face at this speech,\\na certain glance of his bright eye, and curl of his handsome mouth,\\nwhich convinced anne, that instead of sharing in mrs musgrove\\'s kind wishes,\\nas to her son, he had probably been at some pains to get rid of him;\\nbut it was too transient an indulgence of self-amusement to be detected\\nby any who understood him less than herself; in another moment\\nhe was perfectly collected and serious, and almost instantly afterwards\\ncoming up to the sofa, on which she and mrs musgrove were sitting,\\ntook a place by the latter, and entered into conversation with her,\\nin a low voice, about her son, doing it with so much sympathy\\nand natural grace, as shewed the kindest consideration for all\\nthat was real and unabsurd in the parent\\'s feelings.\\n\\nthey were actually on the same sofa, for mrs musgrove had\\nmost readily made room for him; they were divided only by mrs musgrove.\\nit was no insignificant barrier, indeed.  mrs musgrove was of\\na comfortable, substantial size, infinitely more fitted by nature\\nto express good cheer and good humour, than tenderness and sentiment;\\nand while the agitations of anne\\'s slender form, and pensive face,\\nmay be considered as very completely screened, captain wentworth\\nshould be allowed some credit for the self-command with which\\nhe attended to her large fat sighings over the destiny of a son,\\nwhom alive nobody had cared for.\\n\\npersonal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary proportions.\\na large bulky figure has as good a right to be in deep affliction,\\nas the most graceful set of limbs in the world.  but, fair or not fair,\\nthere are unbecoming conjunctions, which reason will patronize in vain--\\nwhich taste cannot tolerate--which ridicule will seize.\\n\\nthe admiral, after taking two or three refreshing turns about the room\\nwith his hands behind him, being called to order by his wife,\\nnow came up to captain wentworth, and without any observation\\nof what he might be interrupting, thinking only of his own thoughts,\\nbegan with--\\n\\n\"if you had been a week later at lisbon, last spring, frederick,\\nyou would have been asked to give a passage to lady mary grierson\\nand her daughters.\"\\n\\n\"should i?  i am glad i was not a week later then.\"\\n\\nthe admiral abused him for his want of gallantry.  he defended himself;\\nthough professing that he would never willingly admit any ladies\\non board a ship of his, excepting for a ball, or a visit,\\nwhich a few hours might comprehend.\\n\\n\"but, if i know myself,\" said he, \"this is from no want of gallantry\\ntowards them.  it is rather from feeling how impossible it is,\\nwith all one\\'s efforts, and all one\\'s sacrifices, to make\\nthe accommodations on board such as women ought to have.\\nthere can be no want of gallantry, admiral, in rating the claims of women\\nto every personal comfort high, and this is what i do.  i hate to hear\\nof women on board, or to see them on board; and no ship under my command\\nshall ever convey a family of ladies anywhere, if i can help it.\"\\n\\nthis brought his sister upon him.\\n\\n\"oh! frederick!  but i cannot believe it of you. --all idle refinement!\\n--women may be as comfortable on board, as in the best house in england.\\ni believe i have lived as much on board as most women, and i know\\nnothing superior to the accommodations of a man-of-war.  i declare\\ni have not a comfort or an indulgence about me, even at kellynch hall,\"\\n(with a kind bow to anne), \"beyond what i always had in most of\\nthe ships i have lived in; and they have been five altogether.\"\\n\\n\"nothing to the purpose,\" replied her brother.  \"you were living\\nwith your husband, and were the only woman on board.\"\\n\\n\"but you, yourself, brought mrs harville, her sister, her cousin,\\nand three children, round from portsmouth to plymouth.  where was this\\nsuperfine, extraordinary sort of gallantry of yours then?\"\\n\\n\"all merged in my friendship, sophia.  i would assist any\\nbrother officer\\'s wife that i could, and i would bring anything\\nof harville\\'s from the world\\'s end, if he wanted it.  but do not imagine\\nthat i did not feel it an evil in itself.\"\\n\\n\"depend upon it, they were all perfectly comfortable.\"\\n\\n\"i might not like them the better for that perhaps.  such a number\\nof women and children have no right to be comfortable on board.\"\\n\\n\"my dear frederick, you are talking quite idly.  pray, what would\\nbecome of us poor sailors\\' wives, who often want to be conveyed to\\none port or another, after our husbands, if everybody had your feelings?\"\\n\\n\"my feelings, you see, did not prevent my taking mrs harville\\nand all her family to plymouth.\"\\n\\n\"but i hate to hear you talking so like a fine gentleman,\\nand as if women were all fine ladies, instead of rational creatures.\\nwe none of us expect to be in smooth water all our days.\"\\n\\n\"ah! my dear,\" said the admiral, \"when he had got a wife,\\nhe will sing a different tune.  when he is married, if we have\\nthe good luck to live to another war, we shall see him do as you and i,\\nand a great many others, have done.  we shall have him very thankful\\nto anybody that will bring him his wife.\"\\n\\n\"ay, that we shall.\"\\n\\n\"now i have done,\" cried captain wentworth.  \"when once married\\npeople begin to attack me with,--`oh! you will think very differently,\\nwhen you are married.\\'  i can only say, `no, i shall not;\\' and then\\nthey say again, `yes, you will,\\' and there is an end of it.\"\\n\\nhe got up and moved away.\\n\\n\"what a great traveller you must have been, ma\\'am!\" said mrs musgrove\\nto mrs croft.\\n\\n\"pretty well, ma\\'am in the fifteen years of my marriage;\\nthough many women have done more.  i have crossed the atlantic\\nfour times, and have been once to the east indies, and back again,\\nand only once; besides being in different places about home:\\ncork, and lisbon, and gibraltar.  but i never went beyond the streights,\\nand never was in the west indies.  we do not call bermuda or bahama,\\nyou know, the west indies.\"\\n\\nmrs musgrove had not a word to say in dissent; she could not accuse herself\\nof having ever called them anything in the whole course of her life.\\n\\n\"and i do assure you, ma\\'am,\" pursued mrs croft, \"that nothing can exceed\\nthe accommodations of a man-of-war; i speak, you know, of the higher rates.\\nwhen you come to a frigate, of course, you are more confined;\\nthough any reasonable woman may be perfectly happy in one of them;\\nand i can safely say, that the happiest part of my life has been spent\\non board a ship.  while we were together, you know, there was nothing\\nto be feared.  thank god!  i have always been blessed with\\nexcellent health, and no climate disagrees with me.  a little disordered\\nalways the first twenty-four hours of going to sea, but never knew\\nwhat sickness was afterwards.  the only time i ever really suffered\\nin body or mind, the only time that i ever fancied myself unwell,\\nor had any ideas of danger, was the winter that i passed by myself at deal,\\nwhen the admiral (captain croft then) was in the north seas.\\ni lived in perpetual fright at that time, and had all manner of\\nimaginary complaints from not knowing what to do with myself,\\nor when i should hear from him next; but as long as we could be together,\\nnothing ever ailed me, and i never met with the smallest inconvenience.\"\\n\\n\"aye, to be sure.  yes, indeed, oh yes!  i am quite of your opinion,\\nmrs croft,\" was mrs musgrove\\'s hearty answer.  \"there is nothing so bad\\nas a separation.  i am quite of your opinion.  i know what it is,\\nfor mr musgrove always attends the assizes, and i am so glad when\\nthey are over, and he is safe back again.\"\\n\\nthe evening ended with dancing.  on its being proposed,\\nanne offered her services, as usual; and though her eyes would sometimes\\nfill with tears as she sat at the instrument, she was extremely glad\\nto be employed, and desired nothing in return but to be unobserved.\\n\\nit was a merry, joyous party, and no one seemed in higher spirits\\nthan captain wentworth.  she felt that he had every thing to elevate\\nhim which general attention and deference, and especially the attention\\nof all the young women, could do.  the miss hayters, the females\\nof the family of cousins already mentioned, were apparently admitted\\nto the honour of being in love with him; and as for henrietta and louisa,\\nthey both seemed so entirely occupied by him, that nothing but\\nthe continued appearance of the most perfect good-will between themselves\\ncould have made it credible that they were not decided rivals.\\nif he were a little spoilt by such universal, such eager admiration,\\nwho could wonder?\\n\\nthese were some of the thoughts which occupied anne, while her fingers\\nwere mechanically at work, proceeding for half an hour together,\\nequally without error, and without consciousness.  once she felt\\nthat he was looking at herself,  observing her altered features,\\nperhaps, trying to trace in them the ruins of the face which had once\\ncharmed him; and once she knew that he must have spoken of her;\\nshe was hardly aware of it, till she heard the answer; but then she was\\nsure of his having asked his partner whether miss elliot never danced?\\nthe answer was, \"oh, no; never; she has quite given up dancing.\\nshe had rather play.  she is never tired of playing.\"  once, too,\\nhe spoke to her.  she had left the instrument on the dancing being over,\\nand he had sat down to try to make out an air which he wished\\nto give the miss musgroves an idea of.  unintentionally she returned\\nto that part of the room; he saw her, and, instantly rising,\\nsaid, with studied politeness--\\n\\n\"i beg your pardon, madam, this is your seat;\" and though she immediately\\ndrew back with a decided negative, he was not to be induced\\nto sit down again.\\n\\nanne did not wish for more of such looks and speeches.\\nhis cold politeness, his ceremonious grace, were worse than anything.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 9\\n\\n\\ncaptain wentworth was come to kellynch as to a home, to stay\\nas long as he liked, being as thoroughly the object of\\nthe admiral\\'s fraternal kindness as of his wife\\'s.  he had intended,\\non first arriving, to proceed very soon into shropshire,\\nand visit the brother settled in that country, but the attractions\\nof uppercross induced him to put this off.  there was so much\\nof friendliness, and of flattery, and of everything most bewitching\\nin his reception there; the old were so hospitable, the young so agreeable,\\nthat he could not but resolve to remain where he was, and take all\\nthe charms and perfections of edward\\'s wife upon credit a little longer.\\n\\nit was soon uppercross with him almost every day.  the musgroves\\ncould hardly be more ready to invite than he to come, particularly\\nin the morning, when he had no companion at home, for the admiral\\nand mrs croft were generally out of doors together, interesting themselves\\nin their new possessions, their grass, and their sheep, and dawdling about\\nin a way not endurable to a third person, or driving out in a gig,\\nlately added to their establishment.\\n\\nhitherto there had been but one opinion of captain wentworth\\namong the musgroves and their dependencies.  it was unvarying,\\nwarm admiration everywhere; but this intimate footing was not more\\nthan established, when a certain charles hayter returned among them,\\nto be a good deal disturbed by it, and to think captain wentworth\\nvery much in the way.\\n\\ncharles hayter was the eldest of all the cousins, and a very amiable,\\npleasing young man, between whom and henrietta there had been\\na considerable appearance of attachment previous to captain wentworth\\'s\\nintroduction.  he was in orders; and having a curacy in the neighbourhood,\\nwhere residence was not required, lived at his father\\'s house,\\nonly two miles from uppercross.  a short absence from home\\nhad left his fair one unguarded by his attentions at this critical period,\\nand when he came back he had the pain of finding very altered manners,\\nand of seeing captain wentworth.\\n\\nmrs musgrove and mrs hayter were sisters.  they had each had money,\\nbut their marriages had made a material difference in\\ntheir degree of consequence.  mr hayter had some property of his own,\\nbut it was insignificant compared with mr musgrove\\'s; and while\\nthe musgroves were in the first class of society in the country,\\nthe young hayters would, from their parents\\' inferior, retired,\\nand unpolished way of living, and their own defective education,\\nhave been hardly in any class at all, but for their connexion\\nwith uppercross, this eldest son of course excepted, who had chosen\\nto be a scholar and a gentleman, and who was very superior\\nin cultivation and manners to all the rest.\\n\\nthe two families had always been on excellent terms, there being no pride\\non one side, and no envy on the other, and only such a consciousness\\nof superiority in the miss musgroves, as made them pleased\\nto improve their cousins.  charles\\'s attentions to henrietta\\nhad been observed by her father and mother without any disapprobation.\\n\"it would not be a great match for her; but if henrietta liked him,\"--\\nand henrietta did seem to like him.\\n\\nhenrietta fully thought so herself, before captain wentworth came;\\nbut from that time cousin charles had been very much forgotten.\\n\\nwhich of the two sisters was preferred by captain wentworth was\\nas yet quite doubtful, as far as anne\\'s observation reached.\\nhenrietta was perhaps the prettiest, louisa had the higher spirits;\\nand she knew not now, whether the more gentle or the more lively character\\nwere most likely to attract him.\\n\\nmr and mrs musgrove, either from seeing little, or from\\nan entire confidence in the discretion of both their daughters,\\nand of all the young men who came near them, seemed to leave everything\\nto take its chance.  there was not the smallest appearance of solicitude\\nor remark about them in the mansion-house; but it was different\\nat the cottage:  the young couple there were more disposed\\nto speculate and wonder; and captain wentworth had not been above\\nfour or five times in the miss musgroves\\' company, and charles hayter\\nhad but just reappeared, when anne had to listen to the opinions\\nof her brother and sister, as to which was the one liked best.\\ncharles gave it for louisa, mary for henrietta, but quite agreeing\\nthat to have him marry either could be extremely delightful.\\n\\ncharles \"had never seen a pleasanter man in his life; and from what\\nhe had once heard captain wentworth himself say, was very sure that\\nhe had not made less than twenty thousand pounds by the war.\\nhere was a fortune at once; besides which, there would be the chance\\nof what might be done in any future war; and he was sure captain wentworth\\nwas as likely a man to distinguish himself as any officer in the navy.\\noh! it would be a capital match for either of his sisters.\"\\n\\n\"upon my word it would,\" replied mary.  \"dear me!  if he should\\nrise to any very great honours!  if he should ever be made a baronet!\\n`lady wentworth\\' sounds very well.  that would be a noble thing,\\nindeed, for henrietta!  she would take place of me then, and henrietta\\nwould not dislike that.  sir frederick and lady wentworth!\\nit would be but a new creation, however, and i never think much\\nof your new creations.\"\\n\\nit suited mary best to think henrietta the one preferred\\non the very account of charles hayter, whose pretensions she wished\\nto see put an end to.  she looked down very decidedly upon the hayters,\\nand thought it would be quite a misfortune to have the existing connection\\nbetween the families renewed--very sad for herself and her children.\\n\\n\"you know,\" said she, \"i cannot think him at all a fit match for henrietta;\\nand considering the alliances which the musgroves have made,\\nshe has no right to throw herself away.  i do not think any young woman\\nhas a right to make a choice that may be disagreeable and inconvenient\\nto the principal part of her family, and be giving bad connections\\nto those who have not been used to them.  and, pray, who is charles hayter?\\nnothing but a country curate.  a most improper match for miss musgrove\\nof uppercross.\"\\n\\nher husband, however, would not agree with her here; for besides having\\na regard for his cousin, charles hayter was an eldest son,\\nand he saw things as an eldest son himself.\\n\\n\"now you are taking nonsense, mary,\" was therefore his answer.\\n\"it would not be a great match for henrietta, but charles has\\na very fair chance, through the spicers, of getting something from\\nthe bishop in the course of a year or two; and you will please to remember,\\nthat he is the eldest son; whenever my uncle dies, he steps into very\\npretty property.  the estate at winthrop is not less than\\ntwo hundred and fifty acres, besides the farm near taunton,\\nwhich is some of the best land in the country.  i grant you,\\nthat any of them but charles would be a very shocking match for henrietta,\\nand indeed it could not be; he is the only one that could be possible;\\nbut he is a very good-natured, good sort of a fellow; and whenever winthrop\\ncomes into his hands, he will make a different sort of place of it,\\nand live in a very different sort of way; and with that property,\\nhe will never be a contemptible man--good, freehold property.  no, no;\\nhenrietta might do worse than marry charles hayter; and if she has him,\\nand louisa can get captain wentworth, i shall be very well satisfied.\"\\n\\n\"charles may say what he pleases,\" cried mary to anne, as soon as\\nhe was out of the room, \"but it would be shocking to have henrietta\\nmarry charles hayter; a very bad thing for her, and still worse\\nfor me; and therefore it is very much to be wished that captain wentworth\\nmay soon put him quite out of her head, and i have very little doubt\\nthat he has.  she took hardly any notice of charles hayter yesterday.\\ni wish you had been there to see her behaviour.  and as to\\ncaptain wentworth\\'s liking louisa as well as henrietta, it is nonsense\\nto say so; for he certainly does like henrietta a great deal the best.\\nbut charles is so positive!  i wish you had been with us yesterday,\\nfor then you might have decided between us; and i am sure you\\nwould have thought as i did, unless you had been determined\\nto give it against me.\"\\n\\na dinner at mr musgrove\\'s had been the occasion when all these things\\nshould have been seen by anne; but she had staid at home,\\nunder the mixed plea of a headache of her own, and some return\\nof indisposition in little charles.  she had thought only of avoiding\\ncaptain wentworth; but an escape from being appealed to as umpire\\nwas now added to the advantages of a quiet evening.\\n\\nas to captain wentworth\\'s views, she deemed it of more consequence\\nthat he should know his own mind early enough not to be endangering\\nthe happiness of either sister, or impeaching his own honour,\\nthan that he should prefer henrietta to louisa, or louisa to henrietta.\\neither of them would, in all probability, make him an affectionate,\\ngood-humoured wife.  with regard to charles hayter, she had delicacy\\nwhich must be pained by any lightness of conduct in a well-meaning\\nyoung woman, and a heart to sympathize in any of the sufferings\\nit occasioned; but if henrietta found herself mistaken in the nature\\nof her feelings, the alternation could not be understood too soon.\\n\\ncharles hayter had met with much to disquiet and mortify him\\nin his cousin\\'s behaviour.  she had too old a regard for him\\nto be so wholly estranged as might in two meetings extinguish\\nevery past hope, and leave him nothing to do but to keep away\\nfrom uppercross:  but there was such a change as became very alarming,\\nwhen such a man as captain wentworth was to be regarded as\\nthe probable cause.  he had been absent only two sundays,\\nand when they parted, had left her interested, even to the height\\nof his wishes, in his prospect of soon quitting his present curacy,\\nand obtaining that of uppercross instead.  it had then seemed the object\\nnearest her heart, that dr shirley, the rector, who for more than\\nforty years had been zealously discharging all the duties of his office,\\nbut was now growing too infirm for many of them, should be quite fixed\\non engaging a curate; should make his curacy quite as good\\nas he could afford, and should give charles hayter the promise of it.\\nthe advantage of his having to come only to uppercross, instead of going\\nsix miles another way; of his having, in every respect, a better curacy;\\nof his belonging to their dear dr shirley, and of dear, good dr shirley\\'s\\nbeing relieved from the duty which he could no longer get through\\nwithout most injurious fatigue, had been a great deal, even to louisa,\\nbut had been almost everything to henrietta.  when he came back, alas!\\nthe zeal of the business was gone by.  louisa could not listen at all\\nto his account of a conversation which he had just held with dr shirley:\\nshe was at a window, looking out for captain wentworth; and even henrietta\\nhad at best only a divided attention to give, and seemed to have forgotten\\nall the former doubt and solicitude of the negotiation.\\n\\n\"well, i am very glad indeed:  but i always thought you would have it;\\ni always thought you sure.  it did not appear to me that--in short,\\nyou know, dr shirley must have a curate, and you had secured his promise.\\nis he coming, louisa?\"\\n\\none morning, very soon after the dinner at the musgroves,\\nat which anne had not been present, captain wentworth walked into\\nthe drawing-room at the cottage, where were only herself and the little\\ninvalid charles, who was lying on the sofa.\\n\\nthe surprise of finding himself almost alone with anne elliot,\\ndeprived his manners of their usual composure:  he started,\\nand could only say, \"i thought the miss musgroves had been here:\\nmrs musgrove told me i should find them here,\" before he walked\\nto the window to recollect himself, and feel how he ought to behave.\\n\\n\"they are up stairs with my sister:  they will be down in a few moments,\\ni dare say,\" had been anne\\'s reply, in all the confusion that was natural;\\nand if the child had not called her to come and do something for him,\\nshe would have been out of the room the next moment, and released\\ncaptain wentworth as well as herself.\\n\\nhe continued at the window; and after calmly and politely saying,\\n\"i hope the little boy is better,\" was silent.\\n\\nshe was obliged to kneel down by the sofa, and remain there\\nto satisfy her patient; and thus they continued a few minutes,\\nwhen, to her very great satisfaction, she heard some other person\\ncrossing the little vestibule.  she hoped, on turning her head,\\nto see the master of the house; but it proved to be one\\nmuch less calculated for making matters easy--charles hayter,\\nprobably not at all better pleased by the sight of captain wentworth\\nthan captain wentworth had been by the sight of anne.\\n\\nshe only attempted to say, \"how do you do?  will you not sit down?\\nthe others will be here presently.\"\\n\\ncaptain wentworth, however, came from his window, apparently\\nnot ill-disposed for conversation; but charles hayter soon put an end\\nto his attempts by seating himself near the table, and taking up\\nthe newspaper; and captain wentworth returned to his window.\\n\\nanother minute brought another addition.  the younger boy,\\na remarkable stout, forward child, of two years old, having got the door\\nopened for him by some one without, made his determined appearance\\namong them, and went straight to the sofa to see what was going on,\\nand put in his claim to anything good that might be giving away.\\n\\nthere being nothing to eat, he could only have some play;\\nand as his aunt would not let him tease his sick brother,\\nhe began to fasten himself upon her, as she knelt, in such a way that,\\nbusy as she was about charles, she could not shake him off.\\nshe spoke to him, ordered, entreated, and insisted in vain.\\nonce she did contrive to push him away, but the boy had\\nthe greater pleasure in getting upon her back again directly.\\n\\n\"walter,\" said she, \"get down this moment.  you are extremely troublesome.\\ni am very angry with you.\"\\n\\n\"walter,\" cried charles hayter, \"why do you not do as you are bid?\\ndo not you hear your aunt speak?  come to me, walter, come to\\ncousin charles.\"\\n\\nbut not a bit did walter stir.\\n\\nin another moment, however, she found herself in the state of\\nbeing released from him; some one was taking him from her,\\nthough he had bent down her head so much, that his little sturdy hands\\nwere unfastened from around her neck, and he was resolutely borne away,\\nbefore she knew that captain wentworth had done it.\\n\\nher sensations on the discovery made her perfectly speechless.\\nshe could not even thank him.  she could only hang over little charles,\\nwith most disordered feelings.  his kindness in stepping forward\\nto her relief, the manner, the silence in which it had passed,\\nthe little particulars of the circumstance, with the conviction soon\\nforced on her by the noise he was studiously making with the child,\\nthat he meant to avoid hearing her thanks, and rather sought\\nto testify that her conversation was the last of his wants,\\nproduced such a confusion of varying, but very painful agitation,\\nas she could not recover from, till enabled by the entrance of mary\\nand the miss musgroves to make over her little patient to their cares,\\nand leave the room.  she could not stay.  it might have been\\nan opportunity of watching the loves and jealousies of the four--\\nthey were now altogether; but she could stay for none of it.\\nit was evident that charles hayter was not well inclined towards\\ncaptain wentworth.  she had a strong impression of his having said,\\nin a vext tone of voice, after captain wentworth\\'s interference,\\n\"you ought to have minded me, walter; i told you not to teaze your aunt;\"\\nand could comprehend his regretting that captain wentworth should do\\nwhat he ought to have done himself.  but neither charles hayter\\'s feelings,\\nnor anybody\\'s feelings, could interest her, till she had a little better\\narranged her own.  she was ashamed of herself, quite ashamed\\nof being so nervous, so overcome by such a trifle; but so it was,\\nand it required a long application of solitude and reflection\\nto recover her.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 10\\n\\n\\nother opportunities of making her observations could not fail to occur.\\nanne had soon been in company with all the four together often enough\\nto have an opinion, though too wise to acknowledge as much at home,\\nwhere she knew it would have satisfied neither husband nor wife;\\nfor while she considered louisa to be rather the favourite,\\nshe could not but think, as far as she might dare to judge from memory\\nand experience, that captain wentworth was not in love with either.\\nthey were more in love with him; yet there it was not love.\\nit was a little fever of admiration; but it might, probably must,\\nend in love with some.  charles hayter seemed aware of being slighted,\\nand yet henrietta had sometimes the air of being divided between them.\\nanne longed for the power of representing to them all what they were about,\\nand of pointing out some of the evils they were exposing themselves to.\\nshe did not attribute guile to any.  it was the highest satisfaction\\nto her to believe captain wentworth not in the least aware\\nof the pain he was occasioning.  there was no triumph, no pitiful triumph\\nin his manner.  he had, probably, never heard, and never thought of\\nany claims of charles hayter.  he was only wrong in accepting\\nthe attentions (for accepting must be the word) of two young women at once.\\n\\nafter a short struggle, however, charles hayter seemed to quit the field.\\nthree days had passed without his coming once to uppercross;\\na most decided change.  he had even refused one regular invitation to dinner;\\nand having been found on the occasion by mr musgrove with some large books\\nbefore him, mr and mrs musgrove were sure all could not be right,\\nand talked, with grave faces, of his studying himself to death.\\nit was mary\\'s hope and belief that he had received a positive dismissal\\nfrom henrietta, and her husband lived under the constant dependence\\nof seeing him to-morrow.  anne could only feel that charles hayter\\nwas wise.\\n\\none morning, about this time charles musgrove and captain wentworth\\nbeing gone a-shooting together, as the sisters in the cottage\\nwere sitting quietly at work, they were visited at the window\\nby the sisters from the mansion-house.\\n\\nit was a very fine november day, and the miss musgroves came\\nthrough the little grounds, and stopped for no other purpose than to say,\\nthat they were going to take a long walk, and therefore concluded\\nmary could not like to go with them; and when mary immediately replied,\\nwith some jealousy at not being supposed a good walker, \"oh, yes,\\ni should like to join you very much, i am very fond of a long walk;\"\\nanne felt persuaded, by the looks of the two girls, that it was precisely\\nwhat they did not wish, and admired again the sort of necessity\\nwhich the family habits seemed to produce, of everything being\\nto be communicated, and everything being to be done together,\\nhowever undesired and inconvenient.  she tried to dissuade mary from going,\\nbut in vain; and that being the case, thought it best to accept\\nthe miss musgroves\\' much more cordial invitation to herself to go likewise,\\nas she might be useful in turning back with her sister, and lessening\\nthe interference in any plan of their own.\\n\\n\"i cannot imagine why they should suppose i should not like a long walk,\"\\nsaid mary, as she went up stairs.  \"everybody is always supposing\\nthat i am not a good walker; and yet they would not have been pleased,\\nif we had refused to join them.  when people come in this manner\\non purpose to ask us, how can one say no?\"\\n\\njust as they were setting off, the gentlemen returned.  they had taken out\\na young dog, who had spoilt their sport, and sent them back early.\\ntheir time and strength, and spirits, were, therefore, exactly ready\\nfor this walk, and they entered into it with pleasure.  could anne\\nhave foreseen such a junction, she would have staid at home; but,\\nfrom some feelings of interest and curiosity, she fancied now that it was\\ntoo late to retract, and the whole six set forward together\\nin the direction chosen by the miss musgroves, who evidently\\nconsidered the walk as under their guidance.\\n\\nanne\\'s object was, not to be in the way of anybody; and where\\nthe narrow paths across the fields made many separations necessary,\\nto keep with her brother and sister.  her pleasure in the walk\\nmust arise from the exercise and the day, from the view of\\nthe last smiles of the year upon the tawny leaves, and withered hedges,\\nand from repeating to herself some few of the thousand poetical\\ndescriptions extant of autumn, that season of peculiar and\\ninexhaustible influence on the mind of taste and tenderness,\\nthat season which had drawn from every poet, worthy of being read,\\nsome attempt at description, or some lines of feeling.\\nshe occupied her mind as much as possible in such like musings\\nand quotations; but it was not possible, that when within reach\\nof captain wentworth\\'s conversation with either of the miss musgroves,\\nshe should not try to hear it; yet she caught little very remarkable.\\nit was mere lively chat, such as any young persons, on an intimate footing,\\nmight fall into.  he was more engaged with louisa than with henrietta.\\nlouisa certainly put more forward for his notice than her sister.\\nthis distinction appeared to increase, and there was one speech\\nof louisa\\'s which struck her.  after one of the many praises of the day,\\nwhich were continually bursting forth, captain wentworth added: --\\n\\n\"what glorious weather for the admiral and my sister!  they meant to take\\na long drive this morning; perhaps we may hail them from\\nsome of these hills.  they talked of coming into this side of the country.\\ni wonder whereabouts they will upset to-day.  oh! it does happen\\nvery often, i assure you; but my sister makes nothing of it;\\nshe would as lieve be tossed out as not.\"\\n\\n\"ah! you make the most of it, i know,\" cried louisa, \"but if it were\\nreally so, i should do just the same in her place.  if i loved a man,\\nas she loves the admiral, i would always be with him, nothing should ever\\nseparate us, and i would rather be overturned by him, than driven safely\\nby anybody else.\"\\n\\nit was spoken with enthusiasm.\\n\\n\"had you?\" cried he, catching the same tone; \"i honour you!\"\\nand there was silence between them for a little while.\\n\\nanne could not immediately fall into a quotation again.  the sweet scenes\\nof autumn were for a while put by, unless some tender sonnet,\\nfraught with the apt analogy of the declining year, with declining\\nhappiness, and the images of youth and hope, and spring, all gone together,\\nblessed her memory.  she roused herself to say, as they struck by order\\ninto another path, \"is not this one of the ways to winthrop?\"\\nbut nobody heard, or, at least, nobody answered her.\\n\\nwinthrop, however, or its environs--for young men are, sometimes\\nto be met with, strolling about near home--was their destination;\\nand after another half mile of gradual ascent through large enclosures,\\nwhere the ploughs at work, and the fresh made path spoke the farmer\\ncounteracting the sweets of poetical despondence, and meaning\\nto have spring again, they gained the summit of the most considerable hill,\\nwhich parted uppercross and winthrop, and soon commanded a full view\\nof the latter, at the foot of the hill on the other side.\\n\\nwinthrop, without beauty and without dignity, was stretched before them\\nan indifferent house, standing low, and hemmed in by the barns and\\nbuildings of a farm-yard.\\n\\nmary exclaimed, \"bless me! here is winthrop.  i declare i had no idea!\\nwell now, i think we had better turn back; i am excessively tired.\"\\n\\nhenrietta, conscious and ashamed, and seeing no cousin charles\\nwalking along any path, or leaning against any gate, was ready\\nto do as mary wished; but \"no!\" said charles musgrove, and \"no, no!\"\\ncried louisa more eagerly, and taking her sister aside, seemed to be\\narguing the matter warmly.\\n\\ncharles, in the meanwhile, was very decidedly declaring his resolution\\nof calling on his aunt, now that he was so near; and very evidently,\\nthough more fearfully, trying to induce his wife to go too.\\nbut this was one of the points on which the lady shewed her strength;\\nand when he recommended the advantage of resting herself a quarter\\nof an hour at winthrop, as she felt so tired, she resolutely answered,\\n\"oh! no, indeed! walking up that hill again would do her more harm\\nthan any sitting down could do her good;\" and, in short,\\nher look and manner declared, that go she would not.\\n\\nafter a little succession of these sort of debates and consultations,\\nit was settled between charles and his two sisters, that he\\nand henrietta should just run down for a few minutes, to see their aunt\\nand cousins, while the rest of the party waited for them at the top\\nof the hill.  louisa seemed the principal arranger of the plan;\\nand, as she went a little way with them, down the hill, still talking\\nto henrietta, mary took the opportunity of looking scornfully around her,\\nand saying to captain wentworth--\\n\\n\"it is very unpleasant, having such connexions!  but, i assure you,\\ni have never been in the house above twice in my life.\"\\n\\nshe received no other answer, than an artificial, assenting smile,\\nfollowed by a contemptuous glance, as he turned away, which anne\\nperfectly knew the meaning of.\\n\\nthe brow of the hill, where they remained, was a cheerful spot:\\nlouisa returned; and mary, finding a comfortable seat for herself\\non the step of a stile, was very well satisfied so long as the others\\nall stood about her; but when louisa drew captain wentworth away,\\nto try for a gleaning of nuts in an adjoining hedge-row,\\nand they were gone by degrees quite out of sight and sound,\\nmary was happy no longer; she quarrelled with her own seat,\\nwas sure louisa had got a much better somewhere, and nothing could\\nprevent her from going to look for a better also.  she turned through\\nthe same gate, but could not see them.  anne found a nice seat\\nfor her, on a dry sunny bank, under the hedge-row, in which\\nshe had no doubt of their still being, in some spot or other.\\nmary sat down for a moment, but it would not do; she was sure louisa\\nhad found a better seat somewhere else, and she would go on\\ntill she overtook her.\\n\\nanne, really tired herself, was glad to sit down; and she very soon heard\\ncaptain wentworth and louisa in the hedge-row, behind her, as if\\nmaking their way back along the rough, wild sort of channel, down the\\ncentre.  they were speaking as they drew near.  louisa\\'s voice was\\nthe first distinguished.  she seemed to be in the middle of some\\neager speech.  what anne first heard was--\\n\\n\"and so, i made her go.  i could not bear that she should be frightened\\nfrom the visit by such nonsense.  what! would i be turned back from\\ndoing a thing that i had determined to do, and that i knew to be right,\\nby the airs and interference of such a person, or of any person i may say?\\nno, i have no idea of being so easily persuaded.  when i have\\nmade up my mind, i have made it; and henrietta seemed entirely\\nto have made up hers to call at winthrop to-day; and yet, she was as near\\ngiving it up, out of nonsensical complaisance!\"\\n\\n\"she would have turned back then, but for you?\"\\n\\n\"she would indeed.  i am almost ashamed to say it.\"\\n\\n\"happy for her, to have such a mind as yours at hand!  after the hints\\nyou gave just now, which did but confirm my own observations,\\nthe last time i was in company with him,  i need not affect\\nto have no comprehension of what is going on.  i see that more than\\na mere dutiful morning visit to your aunt was in question;\\nand woe betide him, and her too, when it comes to things of consequence,\\nwhen they are placed in circumstances requiring fortitude and\\nstrength of mind, if she have not resolution enough to resist\\nidle interference in such a trifle as this.  your sister is\\nan amiable creature; but yours is the character of decision and firmness,\\ni see.  if you value her conduct or happiness, infuse as much\\nof your own spirit into her as you can.  but this, no doubt,\\nyou have been always doing.  it is the worst evil of too yielding\\nand indecisive a character, that no influence over it can be depended on.\\nyou are never sure of a good impression being durable; everybody\\nmay sway it.  let those who would be happy be firm.  here is a nut,\"\\nsaid he, catching one down from an upper bough.  \"to exemplify:\\na beautiful glossy nut, which, blessed with original strength,\\nhas outlived all the storms of autumn.  not a puncture, not\\na weak spot anywhere.  this nut,\" he continued, with playful solemnity,\\n\"while so many of his brethren have fallen and been trodden under foot,\\nis still in possession of all the happiness that a hazel nut can be\\nsupposed capable of.\"  then returning to his former earnest tone--\\n\"my first wish for all whom i am interested in, is that they should be firm.\\nif louisa musgrove would be beautiful and happy in her november of life,\\nshe will cherish all her present powers of mind.\"\\n\\nhe had done, and was unanswered.  it would have surprised anne if louisa\\ncould have readily answered such a speech:  words of such interest,\\nspoken with such serious warmth!  she could imagine what louisa was feeling.\\nfor herself, she feared to move, lest she should be seen.\\nwhile she remained, a bush of low rambling holly protected her,\\nand they were moving on.  before they were beyond her hearing,\\nhowever, louisa spoke again.\\n\\n\"mary is good-natured enough in many respects,\" said she;\\n\"but she does sometimes provoke me excessively, by her nonsense\\nand pride--the elliot pride.  she has a great deal too much\\nof the elliot pride.  we do so wish that charles had married anne instead.\\ni suppose you know he wanted to marry anne?\"\\n\\nafter a moment\\'s pause, captain wentworth said--\\n\\n\"do you mean that she refused him?\"\\n\\n\"oh! yes; certainly.\"\\n\\n\"when did that happen?\"\\n\\n\"i do not exactly know, for henrietta and i were at school at the time;\\nbut i believe about a year before he married mary.  i wish she had\\naccepted him.  we should all have liked her a great deal better;\\nand papa and mamma always think it was her great friend\\nlady russell\\'s doing, that she did not.  they think charles\\nmight not be learned and bookish enough to please lady russell,\\nand that therefore, she persuaded anne to refuse him.\"\\n\\nthe sounds were retreating, and anne distinguished no more.\\nher own emotions still kept her fixed.  she had much to recover from,\\nbefore she could move.  the listener\\'s proverbial fate was\\nnot absolutely hers; she had heard no evil of herself, but she had heard\\na great deal of very painful import.  she saw how her own character\\nwas considered by captain wentworth, and there had been just that degree\\nof feeling and curiosity about her in his manner which must give her\\nextreme agitation.\\n\\nas soon as she could, she went after mary, and having found,\\nand walked back with her to their former station, by the stile,\\nfelt some comfort in their whole party being immediately afterwards\\ncollected, and once more in motion together.  her spirits wanted\\nthe solitude and silence which only numbers could give.\\n\\ncharles and henrietta returned, bringing, as may be conjectured,\\ncharles hayter with them.  the minutiae of the business anne\\ncould not attempt to understand; even captain wentworth did not seem\\nadmitted to perfect confidence here; but that there had been a withdrawing\\non the gentleman\\'s side, and a relenting on the lady\\'s, and that they\\nwere now very glad to be together again, did not admit a doubt.\\nhenrietta looked a little ashamed, but very well pleased;--\\ncharles hayter exceedingly happy:  and they were devoted to each other\\nalmost from the first instant of their all setting forward for uppercross.\\n\\neverything now marked out louisa for captain wentworth;\\nnothing could be plainer; and where many divisions were necessary,\\nor even where they were not, they walked side by side nearly as much\\nas the other two.  in a long strip of meadow land, where there was\\nample space for all, they were thus divided, forming three distinct parties;\\nand to that party of the three which boasted least animation,\\nand least complaisance, anne necessarily belonged.  she joined charles\\nand mary, and was tired enough to be very glad of charles\\'s other arm;\\nbut charles, though in very good humour with her, was out of temper\\nwith his wife.  mary had shewn herself disobliging to him,\\nand was now to reap the consequence, which consequence was\\nhis dropping her arm almost every moment to cut off the heads\\nof some nettles in the hedge with his switch; and when mary began\\nto complain of it, and lament her being ill-used, according to custom,\\nin being on the hedge side, while anne was never incommoded on the other,\\nhe dropped the arms of both to hunt after a weasel which he had\\na momentary glance of, and they could hardly get him along at all.\\n\\nthis long meadow bordered a lane, which their footpath, at the end of it\\nwas to cross, and when the party had all reached the gate of exit,\\nthe carriage advancing in the same direction, which had been\\nsome time heard, was just coming up, and proved to be admiral croft\\'s gig.\\nhe and his wife had taken their intended drive, and were returning home.\\nupon hearing how long a walk the young people had engaged in,\\nthey kindly offered a seat to any lady who might be particularly tired;\\nit would save her a full mile, and they were going through uppercross.\\nthe invitation was general, and generally declined.  the miss musgroves\\nwere not at all tired, and mary was either offended, by not being asked\\nbefore any of the others, or what louisa called the elliot pride\\ncould not endure to make a third in a one horse chaise.\\n\\nthe walking party had crossed the lane, and were surmounting an\\nopposite stile, and the admiral was putting his horse in motion again,\\nwhen captain wentworth cleared the hedge in a moment to say something\\nto his sister.  the something might be guessed by its effects.\\n\\n\"miss elliot, i am sure you are tired,\" cried mrs croft.\\n\"do let us have the pleasure of taking you home.  here is excellent room\\nfor three, i assure you.  if we were all like you, i believe we might\\nsit four.  you must, indeed, you must.\"\\n\\nanne was still in the lane; and though instinctively beginning to decline,\\nshe was not allowed to proceed.  the admiral\\'s kind urgency\\ncame in support of his wife\\'s; they would not be refused;\\nthey compressed themselves into the smallest possible space\\nto leave her a corner, and captain wentworth, without saying a word,\\nturned to her, and quietly obliged her to be assisted into the carriage.\\n\\nyes; he had done it.  she was in the carriage, and felt that he had\\nplaced her there, that his will and his hands had done it,\\nthat she owed it to his perception of her fatigue, and his resolution\\nto give her rest.  she was very much affected by the view of\\nhis disposition towards her, which all these things made apparent.\\nthis little circumstance seemed the completion of all that had gone before.\\nshe understood him.  he could not forgive her, but he could not\\nbe unfeeling.  though condemning her for the past, and considering it\\nwith high and unjust resentment, though perfectly careless of her,\\nand though becoming attached to another, still he could not see her suffer,\\nwithout the desire of giving her relief.  it was a remainder\\nof former sentiment; it was an impulse of pure, though unacknowledged\\nfriendship; it was a proof of his own warm and amiable heart,\\nwhich she could not contemplate without emotions so compounded\\nof pleasure and pain, that she knew not which prevailed.\\n\\nher answers to the kindness and the remarks of her companions\\nwere at first unconsciously given.  they had travelled half their way\\nalong the rough lane, before she was quite awake to what they said.\\nshe then found them talking of \"frederick.\"\\n\\n\"he certainly means to have one or other of those two girls, sophy,\"\\nsaid the admiral; \"but there is no saying which.  he has been\\nrunning after them, too, long enough, one would think, to make up his mind.\\nay, this comes of the peace.  if it were war now, he would have\\nsettled it long ago.  we sailors, miss elliot, cannot afford to make\\nlong courtships in time of war.  how many days was it, my dear,\\nbetween the first time of my seeing you and our sitting down together\\nin our lodgings at north yarmouth?\"\\n\\n\"we had better not talk about it, my dear,\" replied mrs croft, pleasantly;\\n\"for if miss elliot were to hear how soon we came to an understanding,\\nshe would never be persuaded that we could be happy together.\\ni had known you by character, however, long before.\"\\n\\n\"well, and i had heard of you as a very pretty girl, and what were we\\nto wait for besides?  i do not like having such things so long in hand.\\ni wish frederick would spread a little more canvass, and bring us home\\none of these young ladies to kellynch.  then there would always\\nbe company for them.  and very nice young ladies they both are;\\ni hardly know one from the other.\"\\n\\n\"very good humoured, unaffected girls, indeed,\" said mrs croft,\\nin a tone of calmer praise, such as made anne suspect that\\nher keener powers might not consider either of them as quite worthy\\nof her brother; \"and a very respectable family.  one could not be\\nconnected with better people.  my dear admiral, that post!\\nwe shall certainly take that post.\"\\n\\nbut by coolly giving the reins a better direction herself they happily\\npassed the danger; and by once afterwards judiciously putting out\\nher hand they neither fell into a rut, nor ran foul of a dung-cart;\\nand anne, with some amusement at their style of driving,\\nwhich she imagined no bad representation of the general guidance\\nof their affairs, found herself safely deposited by them at the cottage.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 11\\n\\n\\nthe time now approached for lady russell\\'s return:  the day was even fixed;\\nand anne, being engaged to join her as soon as she was resettled,\\nwas looking forward to an early removal to kellynch, and beginning\\nto think how her own comfort was likely to be affected by it.\\n\\nit would place her in the same village with captain wentworth,\\nwithin half a mile of him; they would have to frequent the same church,\\nand there must be intercourse between the two families.\\nthis was against her; but on the other hand, he spent so much of his time\\nat uppercross, that in removing thence she might be considered rather\\nas leaving him behind, than as going towards him; and, upon the whole,\\nshe believed she must, on this interesting question, be the gainer,\\nalmost as certainly as in her change of domestic society,\\nin leaving poor mary for lady russell.\\n\\nshe wished it might be possible for her to avoid ever seeing\\ncaptain wentworth at the hall:  those rooms had witnessed\\nformer meetings which would be brought too painfully before her;\\nbut she was yet more anxious for the possibility of lady russell and\\ncaptain wentworth never meeting anywhere.  they did not like each other,\\nand no renewal of acquaintance now could do any good; and were lady russell\\nto see them together, she might think that he had too much self-possession,\\nand she too little.\\n\\nthese points formed her chief solicitude in anticipating\\nher removal from uppercross, where she felt she had been stationed\\nquite long enough.  her usefulness to little charles would always\\ngive some sweetness to the memory of her two months\\' visit there,\\nbut he was gaining strength apace, and she had nothing else to stay for.\\n\\nthe conclusion of her visit, however, was diversified in a way\\nwhich she had not at all imagined.  captain wentworth, after being unseen\\nand unheard of at uppercross for two whole days, appeared again among them\\nto justify himself by a relation of what had kept him away.\\n\\na letter from his friend, captain harville, having found him out at last,\\nhad brought intelligence of captain harville\\'s being settled\\nwith his family at lyme for the winter; of their being therefore,\\nquite unknowingly, within twenty miles of each other.  captain harville\\nhad never been in good health since a severe wound which he received\\ntwo years before, and captain wentworth\\'s anxiety to see him\\nhad determined him to go immediately to lyme.  he had been there\\nfor four-and-twenty hours.  his acquittal was complete,\\nhis friendship warmly honoured, a lively interest excited for his friend,\\nand his description of the fine country about lyme so feelingly attended to\\nby the party, that an earnest desire to see lyme themselves,\\nand a project for going thither was the consequence.\\n\\nthe young people were all wild to see lyme.  captain wentworth talked\\nof going there again himself, it was only seventeen miles from uppercross;\\nthough november, the weather was by no means bad; and, in short,\\nlouisa, who was the most eager of the eager, having formed\\nthe resolution to go, and besides the pleasure of doing as she liked,\\nbeing now armed with the idea of merit in maintaining her own way,\\nbore down all the wishes of her father and mother for putting it off\\ntill summer; and to lyme they were to go--charles, mary, anne, henrietta,\\nlouisa, and captain wentworth.\\n\\nthe first heedless scheme had been to go in the morning and return at night;\\nbut to this mr musgrove, for the sake of his horses, would not consent;\\nand when it came to be rationally considered, a day in\\nthe middle of november would not leave much time for seeing a new place,\\nafter deducting seven hours, as the nature of the country required,\\nfor going and returning.  they were, consequently, to stay the night there,\\nand not to be expected back till the next day\\'s dinner.  this was felt\\nto be a considerable amendment; and though they all met at the great house\\nat rather an early breakfast hour, and set off very punctually,\\nit was so much past noon before the two carriages, mr musgrove\\'s coach\\ncontaining the four ladies, and charles\\'s curricle, in which\\nhe drove captain wentworth, were descending the long hill into lyme,\\nand entering upon the still steeper street of the town itself,\\nthat it was very evident they would not have more than time\\nfor looking about them, before the light and warmth of the day were gone.\\n\\nafter securing accommodations, and ordering a dinner at one of the inns,\\nthe next thing to be done was unquestionably to walk directly\\ndown to the sea.  they were come too late in the year for any amusement\\nor variety which lyme, as a public place, might offer.  the rooms\\nwere shut up, the lodgers almost all gone, scarcely any family\\nbut of the residents left; and, as there is nothing to admire\\nin the buildings themselves, the remarkable situation of the town,\\nthe principal street almost hurrying into the water, the walk to the cobb,\\nskirting round the pleasant little bay, which, in the season,\\nis animated with bathing machines and company; the cobb itself,\\nits old wonders and new improvements, with the very beautiful\\nline of cliffs stretching out to the east of the town, are what\\nthe stranger\\'s eye will seek; and a very strange stranger it must be,\\nwho does not see charms in the immediate environs of lyme,\\nto make him wish to know it better.  the scenes in its neighbourhood,\\ncharmouth, with its high grounds and extensive sweeps of country,\\nand still more, its sweet, retired bay, backed by dark cliffs,\\nwhere fragments of low rock among the sands, make it the happiest spot\\nfor watching the flow of the tide, for sitting in unwearied contemplation;\\nthe woody varieties of the cheerful village of up lyme; and, above all,\\npinny, with its green chasms between romantic rocks, where\\nthe scattered forest trees and orchards of luxuriant growth,\\ndeclare that many a generation must have passed away since the first\\npartial falling of the cliff prepared the ground for such a state,\\nwhere a scene so wonderful and so lovely is exhibited, as may\\nmore than equal any of the resembling scenes of the far-famed\\nisle of wight:  these places must be visited, and visited again,\\nto make the worth of lyme understood.\\n\\nthe party from uppercross passing down by the now deserted\\nand melancholy looking rooms, and still descending, soon found themselves\\non the sea-shore; and lingering only, as all must linger and gaze\\non a first return to the sea, who ever deserved to look on it at all,\\nproceeded towards the cobb, equally their object in itself\\nand on captain wentworth\\'s account:  for in a small house,\\nnear the foot of an old pier of unknown date, were the harvilles settled.\\ncaptain wentworth turned in to call on his friend; the others walked on,\\nand he was to join them on the cobb.\\n\\nthey were by no means tired of wondering and admiring; and not even louisa\\nseemed to feel that they had parted with captain wentworth long,\\nwhen they saw him coming after them, with three companions,\\nall well known already, by description, to be captain and mrs harville,\\nand a captain benwick, who was staying with them.\\n\\ncaptain benwick had some time ago been first lieutenant of the laconia;\\nand the account which captain wentworth had given of him,\\non his return from lyme before, his warm praise of him as\\nan excellent young man and an officer, whom he had always valued highly,\\nwhich must have stamped him well in the esteem of every listener,\\nhad been followed by a little history of his private life,\\nwhich rendered him perfectly interesting in the eyes of all the ladies.\\nhe had been engaged to captain harville\\'s sister, and was now\\nmourning her loss.  they had been a year or two waiting for fortune\\nand promotion.  fortune came, his prize-money as lieutenant being great;\\npromotion, too, came at last; but fanny harville did not live to know it.\\nshe had died the preceding summer while he was at sea.  captain wentworth\\nbelieved it impossible for man to be more attached to woman\\nthan poor benwick had been to fanny harville, or to be more deeply\\nafflicted under the dreadful change.  he considered his disposition\\nas of the sort which must suffer heavily, uniting very strong feelings\\nwith quiet, serious, and retiring manners, and a decided taste for reading,\\nand sedentary pursuits.  to finish the interest of the story,\\nthe friendship between him and the harvilles seemed, if possible,\\naugmented by the event which closed all their views of alliance,\\nand captain benwick was now living with them entirely.  captain harville\\nhad taken his present house for half a year; his taste, and his health,\\nand his fortune, all directing him to a residence inexpensive,\\nand by the sea; and the grandeur of the country, and the retirement\\nof lyme in the winter, appeared exactly adapted to captain benwick\\'s\\nstate of mind.  the sympathy and good-will excited towards captain benwick\\nwas very great.\\n\\n\"and yet,\" said anne to herself, as they now moved forward\\nto meet the party, \"he has not, perhaps, a more sorrowing heart\\nthan i have.  i cannot believe his prospects so blighted for ever.\\nhe is younger than i am; younger in feeling, if not in fact;\\nyounger as a man.  he will rally again, and be happy with another.\"\\n\\nthey all met, and were introduced.  captain harville was a tall,\\ndark man, with a sensible, benevolent countenance; a little lame;\\nand from strong features and want of health, looking much older\\nthan captain wentworth.  captain benwick looked, and was,\\nthe youngest of the three, and, compared with either of them,\\na little man.  he had a pleasing face and a melancholy air,\\njust as he ought to have, and drew back from conversation.\\n\\ncaptain harville, though not equalling captain wentworth in manners,\\nwas a perfect gentleman, unaffected, warm, and obliging.\\nmrs harville, a degree less polished than her husband, seemed, however,\\nto have the same good feelings; and nothing could be more pleasant\\nthan their desire of considering the whole party as friends of their own,\\nbecause the friends of captain wentworth, or more kindly hospitable\\nthan their entreaties for their all promising to dine with them.\\nthe dinner, already ordered at the inn, was at last, though unwillingly,\\naccepted as a excuse; but they seemed almost hurt that captain wentworth\\nshould have brought any such party to lyme, without considering it\\nas a thing of course that they should dine with them.\\n\\nthere was so much attachment to captain wentworth in all this,\\nand such a bewitching charm in a degree of hospitality so uncommon,\\nso unlike the usual style of give-and-take invitations, and dinners\\nof formality and display, that anne felt her spirits not likely to be\\nbenefited by an increasing acquaintance among his brother-officers.\\n\"these would have been all my friends,\" was her thought;\\nand she had to struggle against a great tendency to lowness.\\n\\non quitting the cobb, they all went in-doors with their new friends,\\nand found rooms so small as none but those who invite from the heart\\ncould think capable of accommodating so many.  anne had\\na moment\\'s astonishment on the subject herself; but it was soon lost\\nin the pleasanter feelings which sprang from the sight of all\\nthe ingenious contrivances and nice arrangements of captain harville,\\nto turn the actual space to the best account, to supply the deficiencies\\nof lodging-house furniture, and defend the windows and doors\\nagainst the winter storms to be expected.  the varieties in\\nthe fitting-up of the rooms, where the common necessaries\\nprovided by the owner, in the common indifferent plight,\\nwere contrasted with some few articles of a rare species of wood,\\nexcellently worked up, and with something curious and valuable\\nfrom all the distant countries captain harville had visited,\\nwere more than amusing to anne; connected as it all was with his profession,\\nthe fruit of its labours, the effect of its influence on his habits,\\nthe picture of repose and domestic happiness it presented,\\nmade it to her a something more, or less, than gratification.\\n\\ncaptain harville was no reader; but he had contrived\\nexcellent accommodations, and fashioned very pretty shelves,\\nfor a tolerable collection of well-bound volumes, the property of\\ncaptain benwick.  his lameness prevented him from taking much exercise;\\nbut a mind of usefulness and ingenuity seemed to furnish him with\\nconstant employment within.  he drew, he varnished, he carpentered,\\nhe glued; he made toys for the children; he fashioned new netting-needles\\nand pins with improvements; and if everything else was done,\\nsat down to his large fishing-net at one corner of the room.\\n\\nanne thought she left great happiness behind her when they\\nquitted the house; and louisa, by whom she found herself walking,\\nburst forth into raptures of admiration and delight on the character\\nof the navy; their friendliness, their brotherliness, their openness,\\ntheir uprightness; protesting that she was convinced of sailors having\\nmore worth and warmth than any other set of men in england;\\nthat they only knew how to live, and they only deserved to be\\nrespected and loved.\\n\\nthey went back to dress and dine; and so well had the scheme\\nanswered already, that nothing was found amiss; though its being\\n\"so entirely out of season,\" and the \"no thoroughfare of lyme,\"\\nand the \"no expectation of company,\" had brought many apologies\\nfrom the heads of the inn.\\n\\nanne found herself by this time growing so much more hardened\\nto being in captain wentworth\\'s company than she had at first imagined\\ncould ever be, that the sitting down to the same table with him now,\\nand the interchange of the common civilities attending on it\\n(they never got beyond), was become a mere nothing.\\n\\nthe nights were too dark for the ladies to meet again till the morrow,\\nbut captain harville had promised them a visit in the evening;\\nand he came, bringing his friend also, which was more than\\nhad been expected, it having been agreed that captain benwick\\nhad all the appearance of being oppressed by the presence of\\nso many strangers.  he ventured among them again, however,\\nthough his spirits certainly did not seem fit for the mirth\\nof the party in general.\\n\\nwhile captains wentworth and harville led the talk on one side of the room,\\nand by recurring to former days, supplied anecdotes in abundance\\nto occupy and entertain the others, it fell to anne\\'s lot to be placed\\nrather apart with captain benwick; and a very good impulse\\nof her nature obliged her to begin an acquaintance with him.\\nhe was shy, and disposed to abstraction; but the engaging mildness of\\nher countenance, and gentleness of her manners, soon had their effect;\\nand anne was well repaid the first trouble of exertion.\\nhe was evidently a young man of considerable taste in reading,\\nthough principally in poetry; and besides the persuasion of having\\ngiven him at least an evening\\'s indulgence in the discussion of subjects,\\nwhich his usual companions had probably no concern in, she had the hope\\nof being of real use to him in some suggestions as to the duty and\\nbenefit of struggling against affliction, which had naturally grown out\\nof their conversation.  for, though shy, he did not seem reserved;\\nit had rather the appearance of feelings glad to burst their\\nusual restraints; and having talked of poetry, the richness of\\nthe present age, and gone through a brief comparison of opinion\\nas to the first-rate poets, trying to ascertain whether marmion\\nor the lady of the lake were to be preferred, and how ranked the giaour\\nand the bride of abydos; and moreover, how the giaour was to be pronounced,\\nhe showed himself so intimately acquainted with all the tenderest songs\\nof the one poet, and all the impassioned descriptions of hopeless agony\\nof the other; he repeated, with such tremulous feeling, the various lines\\nwhich imaged a broken heart, or a mind destroyed by wretchedness,\\nand looked so entirely as if he meant to be understood,\\nthat she ventured to hope he did not always read only poetry,\\nand to say, that she thought it was the misfortune of poetry to be\\nseldom safely enjoyed by those who enjoyed it completely;\\nand that the strong feelings which alone could estimate it truly\\nwere the very feelings which ought to taste it but sparingly.\\n\\nhis looks shewing him not pained, but pleased with this allusion\\nto his situation, she was emboldened to go on; and feeling in herself\\nthe right of seniority of mind, she ventured to recommend\\na larger allowance of prose in his daily study; and on being requested\\nto particularize, mentioned such works of our best moralists,\\nsuch collections of the finest letters, such memoirs of characters\\nof worth and suffering, as occurred to her at the moment\\nas calculated to rouse and fortify the mind by the highest precepts,\\nand the strongest examples of moral and religious endurances.\\n\\ncaptain benwick listened attentively, and seemed grateful for\\nthe interest implied; and though with a shake of the head,\\nand sighs which declared his little faith in the efficacy of any books\\non grief like his, noted down the names of those she recommended,\\nand promised to procure and read them.\\n\\nwhen the evening was over, anne could not but be amused at the idea\\nof her coming to lyme to preach patience and resignation to a young man\\nwhom she had never seen before; nor could she help fearing,\\non more serious reflection, that, like many other great moralists\\nand preachers, she had been eloquent on a point in which her own conduct\\nwould ill bear examination.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 12\\n\\n\\nanne and henrietta, finding themselves the earliest of the party\\nthe next morning, agreed to stroll down to the sea before breakfast.\\nthey went to the sands, to watch the flowing of the tide,\\nwhich a fine south-easterly breeze was bringing in with all the grandeur\\nwhich so flat a shore admitted.  they praised the morning;\\ngloried in the sea; sympathized in the delight of the fresh-feeling\\nbreeze--and were silent; till henrietta suddenly began again with--\\n\\n\"oh! yes,--i am quite convinced that, with very few exceptions,\\nthe sea-air always does good.  there can be no doubt of its having been\\nof the greatest service to dr shirley, after his illness,\\nlast spring twelve-month.  he declares himself, that coming to lyme\\nfor a month, did him more good than all the medicine he took;\\nand, that being by the sea, always makes him feel young again.\\nnow, i cannot help thinking it a pity that he does not live\\nentirely by the sea.  i do think he had better leave uppercross entirely,\\nand fix at lyme.  do not you, anne?  do not you agree with me,\\nthat it is the best thing he could do, both for himself and mrs shirley?\\nshe has cousins here, you know, and many acquaintance, which would\\nmake it cheerful for her, and i am sure she would be glad\\nto get to a place where she could have medical attendance at hand,\\nin case of his having another seizure.  indeed i think it quite melancholy\\nto have such excellent people as dr and mrs shirley, who have been\\ndoing good all their lives, wearing out their last days in a place\\nlike uppercross, where, excepting our family, they seem shut out\\nfrom all the world.  i wish his friends would propose it to him.\\ni really think they ought.  and, as to procuring a dispensation,\\nthere could be no difficulty at his time of life, and with his character.\\nmy only doubt is, whether anything could persuade him to leave his parish.\\nhe is so very strict and scrupulous in his notions; over-scrupulous\\ni must say.  do not you think, anne, it is being over-scrupulous?\\ndo not you think it is quite a mistaken point of conscience,\\nwhen a clergyman sacrifices his health for the sake of duties,\\nwhich may be just as well performed by another person?  and at lyme too,\\nonly seventeen miles off, he would be near enough to hear,\\nif people thought there was anything to complain of.\"\\n\\nanne smiled more than once to herself during this speech,\\nand entered into the subject, as ready to do good by entering into\\nthe feelings of a young lady as of a young man, though here it was good\\nof a lower standard, for what could be offered but general acquiescence?\\nshe said all that was reasonable and proper on the business;\\nfelt the claims of dr shirley to repose as she ought; saw how very\\ndesirable it was that he should have some active, respectable young man,\\nas a resident curate, and was even courteous enough to hint at\\nthe advantage of such resident curate\\'s being married.\\n\\n\"i wish,\" said henrietta, very well pleased with her companion,\\n\"i wish lady russell lived at uppercross, and were intimate\\nwith dr shirley.  i have always heard of lady russell as a woman of\\nthe greatest influence with everybody!  i always look upon her as able\\nto persuade a person to anything!  i am afraid of her, as i have\\ntold you before, quite afraid of her, because she is so very clever;\\nbut i respect her amazingly, and wish we had such a neighbour\\nat uppercross.\"\\n\\nanne was amused by henrietta\\'s manner of being grateful,\\nand amused also that the course of events and the new interests\\nof henrietta\\'s views should have placed her friend at all in favour\\nwith any of the musgrove family; she had only time, however,\\nfor a general answer, and a wish that such another woman\\nwere at uppercross, before all subjects suddenly ceased,\\non seeing louisa and captain wentworth coming towards them.\\nthey came also for a stroll till breakfast was likely to be ready;\\nbut louisa recollecting, immediately afterwards that she had something\\nto procure at a shop, invited them all to go back with her into the town.\\nthey were all at her disposal.\\n\\nwhen they came to the steps, leading upwards from the beach, a gentleman,\\nat the same moment preparing to come down, politely drew back,\\nand stopped to give them way.  they ascended and passed him;\\nand as they passed, anne\\'s face caught his eye, and he looked at her\\nwith a degree of earnest admiration, which she could not be insensible of.\\nshe was looking remarkably well; her very regular, very pretty features,\\nhaving the bloom and freshness of youth restored by the fine wind\\nwhich had been blowing on her complexion, and by the animation of eye\\nwhich it had also produced.  it was evident that the gentleman,\\n(completely a gentleman in manner) admired her exceedingly.\\ncaptain wentworth looked round at her instantly in a way which\\nshewed his noticing of it.  he gave her a momentary glance,\\na glance of brightness, which seemed to say, \"that man is struck with you,\\nand even i, at this moment, see something like anne elliot again.\"\\n\\nafter attending louisa through her business, and loitering about\\na little longer, they returned to the inn; and anne, in passing afterwards\\nquickly from her own chamber to their dining-room, had nearly run against\\nthe very same gentleman, as he came out of an adjoining apartment.\\nshe had before conjectured him to be a stranger like themselves,\\nand determined that a well-looking groom, who was strolling about\\nnear the two inns as they came back, should be his servant.\\nboth master and man being in mourning assisted the idea.\\nit was now proved that he belonged to the same inn as themselves;\\nand this second meeting, short as it was, also proved again\\nby the gentleman\\'s looks, that he thought hers very lovely,\\nand by the readiness and propriety of his apologies, that he was\\na man of exceedingly good manners.  he seemed about thirty,\\nand though not handsome, had an agreeable person.  anne felt that\\nshe should like to know who he was.\\n\\nthey had nearly done breakfast, when the sound of a carriage,\\n(almost the first they had heard since entering lyme) drew half the party\\nto the window.  it was a gentleman\\'s carriage, a curricle,\\nbut only coming round from the stable-yard to the front door;\\nsomebody must be going away.  it was driven by a servant in mourning.\\n\\nthe word curricle made charles musgrove jump up that he might\\ncompare it with his own; the servant in mourning roused anne\\'s curiosity,\\nand the whole six were collected to look, by the time the owner\\nof the curricle was to be seen issuing from the door amidst the bows\\nand civilities of the household, and taking his seat, to drive off.\\n\\n\"ah!\" cried captain wentworth, instantly, and with half a glance at anne,\\n\"it is the very man we passed.\"\\n\\nthe miss musgroves agreed to it; and having all kindly watched him\\nas far up the hill as they could, they returned to the breakfast table.\\nthe waiter came into the room soon afterwards.\\n\\n\"pray,\" said captain wentworth, immediately, \"can you tell us the name\\nof the gentleman who is just gone away?\"\\n\\n\"yes, sir, a mr elliot, a gentleman of large fortune, came in last night\\nfrom sidmouth.  dare say you heard the carriage, sir, while you were\\nat dinner; and going on now for crewkherne, in his way to bath\\nand london.\"\\n\\n\"elliot!\"  many had looked on each other, and many had repeated the name,\\nbefore all this had been got through, even by the smart rapidity\\nof a waiter.\\n\\n\"bless me!\" cried mary; \"it must be our cousin; it must be our mr elliot,\\nit must, indeed!  charles, anne, must not it?  in mourning, you see,\\njust as our mr elliot must be.  how very extraordinary!\\nin the very same inn with us!  anne, must not it be our mr elliot?\\nmy father\\'s next heir?  pray sir,\" turning to the waiter,\\n\"did not you hear, did not his servant say whether he belonged\\nto the kellynch family?\"\\n\\n\"no, ma\\'am, he did not mention no particular family; but he said\\nhis master was a very rich gentleman, and would be a baronight some day.\"\\n\\n\"there! you see!\" cried mary in an ecstasy, \"just as i said!\\nheir to sir walter elliot!  i was sure that would come out,\\nif it was so.  depend upon it, that is a circumstance which his servants\\ntake care to publish, wherever he goes.  but, anne, only conceive\\nhow extraordinary!  i wish i had looked at him more.  i wish we had\\nbeen aware in time, who it was, that he might have been introduced to us.\\nwhat a pity that we should not have been introduced to each other!\\ndo you think he had the elliot countenance?  i hardly looked at him,\\ni was looking at the horses; but i think he had something\\nof the elliot countenance, i wonder the arms did not strike me!\\noh! the great-coat was hanging over the panel, and hid the arms,\\nso it did; otherwise, i am sure, i should have observed them,\\nand the livery too; if the servant had not been in mourning,\\none should have known him by the livery.\"\\n\\n\"putting all these very extraordinary circumstances together,\"\\nsaid captain wentworth, \"we must consider it to be the arrangement\\nof providence, that you should not be introduced to your cousin.\"\\n\\nwhen she could command mary\\'s attention, anne quietly tried\\nto convince her that their father and mr elliot had not, for many years,\\nbeen on such terms as to make the power of attempting an introduction\\nat all desirable.\\n\\nat the same time, however, it was a secret gratification to herself\\nto have seen her cousin, and to know that the future owner of kellynch\\nwas undoubtedly a gentleman, and had an air of good sense.\\nshe would not, upon any account, mention her having met with him\\nthe second time; luckily mary did not much attend to their having\\npassed close by him in their earlier walk, but she would have felt\\nquite ill-used by anne\\'s having actually run against him in the passage,\\nand received his very polite excuses, while she had never been\\nnear him at all; no, that cousinly little interview must remain\\na perfect secret.\\n\\n\"of course,\" said mary, \"you will mention our seeing mr elliot,\\nthe next time you write to bath.  i think my father certainly\\nought to hear of it; do mention all about him.\"\\n\\nanne avoided a direct reply, but it was just the circumstance\\nwhich she considered as not merely unnecessary to be communicated,\\nbut as what ought to be suppressed.  the offence which had been given\\nher father, many years back, she knew; elizabeth\\'s particular share in it\\nshe suspected; and that mr elliot\\'s idea always produced irritation in both\\nwas beyond a doubt.  mary never wrote to bath herself; all the toil\\nof keeping up a slow and unsatisfactory correspondence with elizabeth\\nfell on anne.\\n\\nbreakfast had not been long over, when they were joined by captain\\nand mrs harville and captain benwick; with whom they had appointed\\nto take their last walk about lyme.  they ought to be setting off\\nfor uppercross by one, and in the mean while were to be all together,\\nand out of doors as long as they could.\\n\\nanne found captain benwick getting near her, as soon as they were all\\nfairly in the street.  their conversation the preceding evening\\ndid not disincline him to seek her again; and they walked together\\nsome time, talking as before of mr scott and lord byron,\\nand still as unable as before, and as unable as any other two readers,\\nto think exactly alike of the merits of either, till something\\noccasioned an almost general change amongst their party, and instead of\\ncaptain benwick, she had captain harville by her side.\\n\\n\"miss elliot,\" said he, speaking rather low, \"you have done a good deed\\nin making that poor fellow talk so much.  i wish he could have\\nsuch company oftener.  it is bad for him, i know, to be shut up as he is;\\nbut what can we do?  we cannot part.\"\\n\\n\"no,\" said anne, \"that i can easily believe to be impossible;\\nbut in time, perhaps--we know what time does in every case of affliction,\\nand you must remember, captain harville, that your friend\\nmay yet be called a young mourner--only last summer, i understand.\"\\n\\n\"ay, true enough,\" (with a deep sigh) \"only june.\"\\n\\n\"and not known to him, perhaps, so soon.\"\\n\\n\"not till the first week of august, when he came home from the cape,\\njust made into the grappler.  i was at plymouth dreading to hear of him;\\nhe sent in letters, but the grappler was under orders for portsmouth.\\nthere the news must follow him, but who was to tell it? not i.\\ni would as soon have been run up to the yard-arm.  nobody could do it,\\nbut that good fellow\" (pointing to captain wentworth.)  \"the laconia\\nhad come into plymouth the week before; no danger of her\\nbeing sent to sea again.  he stood his chance for the rest;\\nwrote up for leave of absence, but without waiting the return,\\ntravelled night and day till he got to portsmouth, rowed off\\nto the grappler that instant, and never left the poor fellow for a week.\\nthat\\'s what he did, and nobody else could have saved poor james.\\nyou may think, miss elliot, whether he is dear to us!\"\\n\\nanne did think on the question with perfect decision, and said as much\\nin reply as her own feeling could accomplish, or as his seemed\\nable to bear, for he was too much affected to renew the subject,\\nand when he spoke again, it was of something totally different.\\n\\nmrs harville\\'s giving it as her opinion that her husband would have\\nquite walking enough by the time he reached home, determined the direction\\nof all the party in what was to be their last walk; they would\\naccompany them to their door, and then return and set off themselves.\\nby all their calculations there was just time for this; but as they drew\\nnear the cobb, there was such a general wish to walk along it once more,\\nall were so inclined, and louisa soon grew so determined,\\nthat the difference of a quarter of an hour, it was found,\\nwould be no difference at all; so with all the kind leave-taking,\\nand all the kind interchange of invitations and promises which\\nmay be imagined, they parted from captain and mrs harville\\nat their own door, and still accompanied by captain benwick,\\nwho seemed to cling to them to the last, proceeded to make\\nthe proper adieus to the cobb.\\n\\nanne found captain benwick again drawing near her.  lord byron\\'s\\n\"dark blue seas\" could not fail of being brought forward by\\ntheir present view, and she gladly gave him all her attention as long as\\nattention was possible.  it was soon drawn, perforce another way.\\n\\nthere was too much wind to make the high part of the new cobb pleasant\\nfor the ladies, and they agreed to get down the steps to the lower,\\nand all were contented to pass quietly and carefully down the steep flight,\\nexcepting louisa; she must be jumped down them by captain wentworth.\\nin all their walks, he had had to jump her from the stiles;\\nthe sensation was delightful to her.  the hardness of the pavement\\nfor her feet, made him less willing upon the present occasion;\\nhe did it, however.  she was safely down, and instantly,\\nto show her enjoyment, ran up the steps to be jumped down again.\\nhe advised her against it, thought the jar too great; but no,\\nhe reasoned and talked in vain, she smiled and said, \"i am determined\\ni will:\" he put out his hands; she was too precipitate by half a second,\\nshe fell on the pavement on the lower cobb, and was taken up lifeless!\\nthere was no wound, no blood, no visible bruise; but her eyes were closed,\\nshe breathed not, her face was like death.  the horror of the moment\\nto all who stood around!\\n\\ncaptain wentworth, who had caught her up, knelt with her in his arms,\\nlooking on her with a face as pallid as her own, in an agony of silence.\\n\"she is dead! she is dead!\" screamed mary, catching hold of her\\nhusband, and contributing with his own horror to make him immoveable;\\nand in another moment, henrietta, sinking under the conviction, lost\\nher senses too, and would have fallen on the steps, but for captain\\nbenwick and anne, who caught and supported her between them.\\n\\n\"is there no one to help me?\" were the first words which\\nburst from captain wentworth, in a tone of despair, and as if\\nall his own strength were gone.\\n\\n\"go to him, go to him,\" cried anne, \"for heaven\\'s sake go to him.\\ni can support her myself.  leave me, and go to him.  rub her hands,\\nrub her temples; here are salts; take them, take them.\"\\n\\ncaptain benwick obeyed, and charles at the same moment,\\ndisengaging himself from his wife, they were both with him;\\nand louisa was raised up and supported more firmly between them,\\nand everything was done that anne had prompted, but in vain;\\nwhile captain wentworth, staggering against the wall for his support,\\nexclaimed in the bitterest agony--\\n\\n\"oh god! her father and mother!\"\\n\\n\"a surgeon!\" said anne.\\n\\nhe caught the word; it seemed to rouse him at once, and saying only--\\n\"true, true, a surgeon this instant,\" was darting away,\\nwhen anne eagerly suggested--\\n\\n\"captain benwick, would not it be better for captain benwick?\\nhe knows where a surgeon is to be found.\"\\n\\nevery one capable of thinking felt the advantage of the idea,\\nand in a moment (it was all done in rapid moments) captain benwick had\\nresigned the poor corpse-like  figure entirely to the brother\\'s care,\\nand was off for the town with the utmost rapidity.\\n\\nas to the wretched party left behind, it could scarcely be said\\nwhich of the three, who were completely rational, was suffering most:\\ncaptain wentworth, anne, or charles, who, really a very affectionate\\nbrother, hung over louisa with sobs of grief, and could only turn his eyes\\nfrom one sister, to see the other in a state as insensible,\\nor to witness the hysterical agitations of his wife, calling on him\\nfor help which he could not give.\\n\\nanne, attending with all the strength and zeal, and thought,\\nwhich instinct supplied, to henrietta, still tried, at intervals,\\nto suggest comfort to the others, tried to quiet mary, to animate charles,\\nto assuage the feelings of captain wentworth.  both seemed to look to her\\nfor directions.\\n\\n\"anne, anne,\" cried charles, \"what is to be done next?\\nwhat, in heaven\\'s name, is to be done next?\"\\n\\ncaptain wentworth\\'s eyes were also turned towards her.\\n\\n\"had not she better be carried to the inn?  yes, i am sure:\\ncarry her gently to the inn.\"\\n\\n\"yes, yes, to the inn,\" repeated captain wentworth, comparatively\\ncollected, and eager to be doing something.  \"i will carry her myself.\\nmusgrove, take care of the others.\"\\n\\nby this time the report of the accident had spread among the workmen\\nand boatmen about the cobb, and many were collected near them,\\nto be useful if wanted, at any rate, to enjoy the sight of\\na dead young lady, nay, two dead young ladies, for it proved twice as fine\\nas the first report.  to some of the best-looking of these good people\\nhenrietta was consigned, for, though partially revived,\\nshe was quite helpless; and in this manner, anne walking by her side,\\nand charles attending to his wife, they set forward, treading back\\nwith feelings unutterable, the ground, which so lately, so very lately,\\nand so light of heart, they had passed along.\\n\\nthey were not off the cobb, before the harvilles met them.\\ncaptain benwick had been seen flying by their house, with a countenance\\nwhich showed something to be wrong; and they had set off immediately,\\ninformed and directed as they passed, towards the spot.\\nshocked as captain harville was, he brought senses and nerves\\nthat could be instantly useful; and a look between him and his wife\\ndecided what was to be done.  she must be taken to their house;\\nall must go to their house; and await the surgeon\\'s arrival there.\\nthey would not listen to scruples:  he was obeyed; they were all\\nbeneath his roof; and while louisa, under mrs harville\\'s direction,\\nwas conveyed up stairs, and given possession of her own bed,\\nassistance, cordials, restoratives were supplied by her husband\\nto all who needed them.\\n\\nlouisa had once opened her eyes, but soon closed them again,\\nwithout apparent consciousness.  this had been a proof of life,\\nhowever, of service to her sister; and henrietta, though perfectly\\nincapable of being in the same room with louisa, was kept,\\nby the agitation of hope and fear, from a return of her own insensibility.\\nmary, too, was growing calmer.\\n\\nthe surgeon was with them almost before it had seemed possible.\\nthey were sick with horror, while he examined; but he was not hopeless.\\nthe head had received a severe contusion, but he had seen greater injuries\\nrecovered from:  he was by no means hopeless; he spoke cheerfully.\\n\\nthat he did not regard it as a desperate case, that he did not say\\na few hours must end it, was at first felt, beyond the hope of most;\\nand the ecstasy of such a reprieve, the rejoicing, deep and silent,\\nafter a few fervent ejaculations of gratitude to heaven had been offered,\\nmay be conceived.\\n\\nthe tone, the look, with which \"thank god!\" was uttered\\nby captain wentworth, anne was sure could never be forgotten by her;\\nnor the sight of him afterwards, as he sat near a table, leaning over it\\nwith folded arms and face concealed, as if overpowered by\\nthe various feelings of his soul, and trying by prayer and reflection\\nto calm them.\\n\\nlouisa\\'s limbs had escaped.  there was no injury but to the head.\\n\\nit now became necessary for the party to consider what was best to be done,\\nas to their general situation.  they were now able to speak to each other\\nand consult.  that louisa must remain where she was, however distressing\\nto her friends to be involving the harvilles in such trouble,\\ndid not admit a doubt.  her removal was impossible.  the harvilles\\nsilenced all scruples; and, as much as they could, all gratitude.\\nthey had looked forward and arranged everything before the others\\nbegan to reflect.  captain benwick must give up his room to them,\\nand get another bed elsewhere; and the whole was settled.\\nthey were only concerned that the house could accommodate no more;\\nand yet perhaps, by \"putting the children away in the maid\\'s room,\\nor swinging a cot somewhere,\" they could hardly bear to think of not\\nfinding room for two or three besides, supposing they might wish to stay;\\nthough, with regard to any attendance on miss musgrove, there need not be\\nthe least uneasiness in leaving her to mrs harville\\'s care entirely.\\nmrs harville was a very experienced nurse, and her nursery-maid,\\nwho had lived with her long, and gone about with her everywhere,\\nwas just such another.  between these two, she could want\\nno possible attendance by day or night.  and all this was said\\nwith a truth and sincerity of feeling irresistible.\\n\\ncharles, henrietta, and captain wentworth were the three in consultation,\\nand for a little while it was only an interchange of perplexity and terror.\\n\"uppercross, the necessity of some one\\'s going to uppercross;\\nthe news to be conveyed; how it could be broken to mr and mrs musgrove;\\nthe lateness of the morning; an hour already gone since they\\nought to have been off; the impossibility of being in tolerable time.\"\\nat first, they were capable of nothing more to the purpose\\nthan such exclamations; but, after a while, captain wentworth,\\nexerting himself, said--\\n\\n\"we must be decided, and without the loss of another minute.\\nevery minute is valuable.  some one must resolve on being off\\nfor uppercross instantly.  musgrove, either you or i must go.\"\\n\\ncharles agreed, but declared his resolution of not going away.\\nhe would be as little incumbrance as possible to captain and mrs harville;\\nbut as to leaving his sister in such a state, he neither ought, nor would.\\nso far it was decided; and henrietta at first declared the same.\\nshe, however, was soon persuaded to think differently.  the usefulness\\nof her staying!  she who had not been able to remain in louisa\\'s room,\\nor to look at her, without sufferings which made her worse than helpless!\\nshe was forced to acknowledge that she could do no good,\\nyet was still unwilling to be away, till, touched by the thought\\nof her father and mother, she gave it up; she consented,\\nshe was anxious to be at home.\\n\\nthe plan had reached this point, when anne, coming quietly\\ndown from louisa\\'s room, could not but hear what followed,\\nfor the parlour door was open.\\n\\n\"then it is settled, musgrove,\" cried captain wentworth,\\n\"that you stay, and that i take care of your sister home.\\nbut as to the rest, as to the others, if one stays to assist mrs harville,\\ni think it need be only one.  mrs charles musgrove will, of course,\\nwish to get back to her children; but if anne will stay, no one so proper,\\nso capable as anne.\"\\n\\nshe paused a moment to recover from the emotion of hearing herself\\nso spoken of.  the other two warmly agreed with what he said,\\nand she then appeared.\\n\\n\"you will stay, i am sure; you will stay and nurse her;\" cried he,\\nturning to her and speaking with a glow, and yet a gentleness,\\nwhich seemed almost restoring the past.  she coloured deeply,\\nand he recollected himself and moved away.  she expressed herself\\nmost willing, ready, happy to remain.  \"it was what she had been\\nthinking of, and wishing to be allowed to do.  a bed on the floor\\nin louisa\\'s room would be sufficient for her, if mrs harville\\nwould but think so.\"\\n\\none thing more, and all seemed arranged.  though it was rather desirable\\nthat mr and mrs musgrove should be previously alarmed by some\\nshare of delay; yet the time required by the uppercross horses\\nto take them back, would be a dreadful extension of suspense;\\nand captain wentworth proposed, and charles musgrove agreed,\\nthat it would be much better for him to take a chaise from the inn,\\nand leave mr musgrove\\'s carriage and horses to be sent home\\nthe next morning early, when there would be the farther advantage\\nof sending an account of louisa\\'s night.\\n\\ncaptain wentworth now hurried off to get everything ready on his part,\\nand to be soon followed by the two ladies.  when the plan was\\nmade known to mary, however, there was an end of all peace in it.\\nshe was so wretched and so vehement, complained so much of injustice\\nin being expected to go away instead of anne; anne, who was\\nnothing to louisa, while she was her sister, and had the best right\\nto stay in henrietta\\'s stead!  why was not she to be as useful as anne?\\nand to go home without charles, too, without her husband!\\nno, it was too unkind.  and in short, she said more than her husband\\ncould long withstand, and as none of the others could oppose\\nwhen he gave way, there was no help for it; the change of mary for anne\\nwas inevitable.\\n\\nanne had never submitted more reluctantly to the jealous\\nand ill-judging claims of mary; but so it must be, and they set off\\nfor the town, charles taking care of his sister, and captain benwick\\nattending to her.  she gave a moment\\'s recollection, as they hurried along,\\nto the little circumstances which the same spots had witnessed\\nearlier in the morning.  there she had listened to henrietta\\'s schemes\\nfor dr shirley\\'s leaving uppercross; farther on, she had\\nfirst seen mr elliot; a moment seemed all that could now be given\\nto any one but louisa, or those who were wrapt up in her welfare.\\n\\ncaptain benwick was most considerately attentive to her; and,\\nunited as they all seemed by the distress of the day, she felt\\nan increasing degree of good-will towards him, and a pleasure even\\nin thinking that it might, perhaps, be the occasion of continuing\\ntheir acquaintance.\\n\\ncaptain wentworth was on the watch for them, and a chaise and four in waiting,\\nstationed for their convenience in the lowest part of the street;\\nbut his evident surprise and vexation at the substitution of one sister\\nfor the other, the change in his countenance, the astonishment,\\nthe expressions begun and suppressed, with which charles was listened to,\\nmade but a mortifying reception of anne; or must at least convince her\\nthat she was valued only as she could be useful to louisa.\\n\\nshe endeavoured to be composed, and to be just.  without emulating\\nthe feelings of an emma towards her henry, she would have\\nattended on louisa with a zeal above the common claims of regard,\\nfor his sake; and she hoped he would not long be so unjust\\nas to suppose she would shrink unnecessarily from the office of a friend.\\n\\nin the mean while she was in the carriage.  he had handed them both in,\\nand placed himself between them; and in this manner, under these\\ncircumstances, full of astonishment and emotion to anne, she quitted lyme.\\nhow the long stage would pass; how it was to affect their manners;\\nwhat was to be their sort of intercourse, she could not foresee.\\nit was all quite natural, however.  he was devoted to henrietta;\\nalways turning towards her; and when he spoke at all, always with the view\\nof supporting her hopes and raising her spirits.  in general,\\nhis voice and manner were studiously calm.  to spare henrietta\\nfrom agitation seemed the governing principle.  once only,\\nwhen she had been grieving over the last ill-judged, ill-fated\\nwalk to the cobb, bitterly lamenting that it ever had been thought of,\\nhe burst forth, as if wholly overcome--\\n\\n\"don\\'t talk of it, don\\'t talk of it,\" he cried.  \"oh god! that i had\\nnot given way to her at the fatal moment!  had i done as i ought!\\nbut so eager and so resolute! dear, sweet louisa!\"\\n\\nanne wondered whether it ever occurred to him now, to question the justness\\nof his own previous opinion as to the universal felicity and advantage\\nof firmness of character; and whether it might not strike him that,\\nlike all other qualities of the mind, it should have its proportions\\nand limits.  she thought it could scarcely escape him to feel\\nthat a persuadable temper might sometimes be as much in favour of happiness\\nas a very resolute character.\\n\\nthey got on fast.  anne was astonished to recognise the same hills\\nand the same objects so soon.  their actual speed, heightened by\\nsome dread of the conclusion, made the road appear but half as long\\nas on the day before.  it was growing quite dusk, however,\\nbefore they were in the neighbourhood of uppercross, and there had been\\ntotal silence among them for some time, henrietta leaning back\\nin the corner, with a shawl over her face, giving the hope of her\\nhaving cried herself to sleep; when, as they were going up their last hill,\\nanne found herself all at once addressed by captain wentworth.\\nin a low, cautious voice, he said: --\\n\\n\"i have been considering what we had best do.  she must not\\nappear at first.  she could not stand it.  i have been thinking whether\\nyou had not better remain in the carriage with her, while i go in\\nand break it to mr and mrs musgrove.  do you think this is a good plan?\"\\n\\nshe did:  he was satisfied, and said no more.  but the remembrance\\nof the appeal remained a pleasure to her, as a proof of friendship,\\nand of deference for her judgement, a great pleasure; and when it became\\na sort of parting proof, its value did not lessen.\\n\\nwhen the distressing communication at uppercross was over,\\nand he had seen the father and mother quite as composed as could be hoped,\\nand the daughter all the better for being with them, he announced\\nhis intention of returning in the same carriage to lyme;\\nand when the horses were baited, he was off.\\n\\n(end of volume one.)\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 13\\n\\n\\nthe remainder of anne\\'s time at uppercross, comprehending only two days,\\nwas spent entirely at the mansion house; and she had the satisfaction\\nof knowing herself extremely useful there, both as an immediate companion,\\nand as assisting in all those arrangements for the future, which,\\nin mr and mrs musgrove\\'s distressed state of spirits, would have\\nbeen difficulties.\\n\\nthey had an early account from lyme the next morning.  louisa was\\nmuch the same.  no symptoms worse than before had appeared.\\ncharles came a few hours afterwards, to bring a later and\\nmore particular account.  he was tolerably cheerful.  a speedy cure\\nmust not be hoped, but everything was going on as well\\nas the nature of the case admitted.  in speaking of the harvilles,\\nhe seemed unable to satisfy his own sense of their kindness,\\nespecially of mrs harville\\'s exertions as a nurse.  \"she really left\\nnothing for mary to do.  he and mary had been persuaded to go early\\nto their inn last night.  mary had been hysterical again this morning.\\nwhen he came away, she was going to walk out with captain benwick,\\nwhich, he hoped, would do her good.  he almost wished she had been\\nprevailed on to come home the day before; but the truth was,\\nthat mrs harville left nothing for anybody to do.\"\\n\\ncharles was to return to lyme the same afternoon, and his father\\nhad at first half a mind to go with him, but the ladies could not consent.\\nit would be going only to multiply trouble to the others,\\nand increase his own distress; and a much better scheme followed\\nand was acted upon.  a chaise was sent for from crewkherne,\\nand charles conveyed back a far more useful person in the old nursery-maid\\nof the family, one who having brought up all the children,\\nand seen the very last, the lingering and long-petted master harry,\\nsent to school after his brothers, was now living in her deserted nursery\\nto mend stockings and dress all the blains and bruises she could\\nget near her, and who, consequently, was only too happy in being\\nallowed to go and help nurse dear miss louisa.  vague wishes of\\ngetting sarah thither, had occurred before to mrs musgrove and henrietta;\\nbut without anne, it would hardly have been resolved on,\\nand found practicable so soon.\\n\\nthey were indebted, the next day, to charles hayter, for all\\nthe minute knowledge of louisa, which it was so essential to obtain\\nevery twenty-four hours.  he made it his business to go to lyme,\\nand his account was still encouraging.  the intervals of sense\\nand consciousness were believed to be stronger.  every report agreed\\nin captain wentworth\\'s appearing fixed in lyme.\\n\\nanne was to leave them on the morrow, an event which they all dreaded.\\n\"what should they do without her?  they were wretched comforters\\nfor one another.\"  and so much was said in this way, that anne thought\\nshe could not do better than impart among them the general inclination\\nto which she was privy, and persuaded them all to go to lyme at once.\\nshe had little difficulty; it was soon determined that they would go;\\ngo to-morrow, fix themselves at the inn, or get into lodgings,\\nas it suited, and there remain till dear louisa could be moved.\\nthey must be taking off some trouble from the good people she was with;\\nthey might at least relieve mrs harville from the care of her own children;\\nand in short, they were so happy in the decision, that anne was delighted\\nwith what she had done, and felt that she could not spend her\\nlast morning at uppercross better than in assisting their preparations,\\nand sending them off at an early hour, though her being left\\nto the solitary range of the house was the consequence.\\n\\nshe was the last, excepting the little boys at the cottage,\\nshe was the very last, the only remaining one of all that had filled\\nand animated both houses, of all that had given uppercross\\nits cheerful character.  a few days had made a change indeed!\\n\\nif louisa recovered, it would all be well again.  more than\\nformer happiness would be restored.  there could not be a doubt,\\nto her mind there was none, of what would follow her recovery.\\na few months hence, and the room now so deserted, occupied but by\\nher silent, pensive self, might be filled again with all that was happy\\nand gay, all that was glowing and bright in prosperous love,\\nall that was most unlike anne elliot!\\n\\nan hour\\'s complete leisure for such reflections as these,\\non a dark november day, a small thick rain almost blotting out\\nthe very few objects ever to be discerned from the windows, was enough\\nto make the sound of lady russell\\'s carriage exceedingly welcome;\\nand yet, though desirous to be gone, she could not quit the mansion house,\\nor look an adieu to the cottage, with its black, dripping and\\ncomfortless veranda, or even notice through the misty glasses\\nthe last humble tenements of the village, without a saddened heart.\\nscenes had passed in uppercross which made it precious.\\nit stood the record of many sensations of pain, once severe,\\nbut now softened; and of some instances of relenting feeling,\\nsome breathings of friendship and reconciliation, which could\\nnever be looked for again, and which could never cease to be dear.\\nshe left it all behind her, all but the recollection that\\nsuch things had been.\\n\\nanne had never entered kellynch since her quitting lady russell\\'s house\\nin september.  it had not been necessary, and the few occasions of\\nits being possible for her to go to the hall she had contrived to evade\\nand escape from.  her first return was to resume her place in the modern\\nand elegant apartments of the lodge, and to gladden the eyes\\nof its mistress.\\n\\nthere was some anxiety mixed with lady russell\\'s joy in meeting her.\\nshe knew who had been frequenting uppercross.  but happily,\\neither anne was improved in plumpness and looks, or lady russell\\nfancied her so; and anne, in receiving her compliments on the occasion,\\nhad the amusement of connecting them with the silent admiration\\nof her cousin, and of hoping that she was to be blessed with\\na second spring of youth and beauty.\\n\\nwhen they came to converse, she was soon sensible of some mental change.\\nthe subjects of which her heart had been full on leaving kellynch,\\nand which she had felt slighted, and been compelled to smother\\namong the musgroves, were now become but of secondary interest.\\nshe had lately lost sight even of her father and sister and bath.\\ntheir concerns had been sunk under those of uppercross;\\nand when lady russell reverted to their former hopes and fears,\\nand spoke her satisfaction in the house in camden place,\\nwhich had been taken, and her regret that mrs clay should still\\nbe with them, anne would have been ashamed to have it known\\nhow much more she was thinking of lyme and louisa musgrove,\\nand all her acquaintance there; how much more interesting to her\\nwas the home and the friendship of the harvilles and captain benwick,\\nthan her own father\\'s house in camden place, or her own sister\\'s intimacy\\nwith mrs clay.  she was actually forced to exert herself\\nto meet lady russell with anything like the appearance of equal solicitude,\\non topics which had by nature the first claim on her.\\n\\nthere was a little awkwardness at first in their discourse\\non another subject.  they must speak of the accident at lyme.\\nlady russell had not been arrived five minutes the day before,\\nwhen a full account of the whole had burst on her; but still it must\\nbe talked of, she must make enquiries, she must regret the imprudence,\\nlament the result, and captain wentworth\\'s name must be mentioned by both.\\nanne was conscious of not doing it so well as lady russell.\\nshe could not speak the name, and look straight forward to\\nlady russell\\'s eye, till she had adopted the expedient of telling her\\nbriefly what she thought of the attachment between him and louisa.\\nwhen this was told, his name distressed her no longer.\\n\\nlady russell had only to listen composedly, and wish them happy,\\nbut internally her heart revelled in angry pleasure, in pleased contempt,\\nthat the man who at twenty-three had seemed to understand somewhat\\nof the value of an anne elliot, should, eight years afterwards,\\nbe charmed by a louisa musgrove.\\n\\nthe first three or four days passed most quietly, with no circumstance\\nto mark them excepting the receipt of a note or two from lyme,\\nwhich found their way to anne, she could not tell how, and brought\\na rather improving account of louisa.  at the end of that period,\\nlady russell\\'s politeness could repose no longer, and the fainter\\nself-threatenings of the past became in a decided tone,\\n\"i must call on mrs croft; i really must call upon her soon.\\nanne, have you courage to go with me, and pay a visit in that house?\\nit will be some trial to us both.\"\\n\\nanne did not shrink from it; on the contrary, she truly felt as she said,\\nin observing--\\n\\n\"i think you are very likely to suffer the most of the two;\\nyour feelings are less reconciled to the change than mine.\\nby remaining in the neighbourhood, i am become inured to it.\"\\n\\nshe could have said more on the subject; for she had in fact\\nso high an opinion of the crofts, and considered her father\\nso very fortunate in his tenants, felt the parish to be so sure\\nof a good example, and the poor of the best attention and relief,\\nthat however sorry and ashamed for the necessity of the removal,\\nshe could not but in conscience feel that they were gone\\nwho deserved not to stay, and that kellynch hall had passed\\ninto better hands than its owners\\'.  these convictions must unquestionably\\nhave their own pain, and severe was its kind; but they precluded\\nthat pain which lady russell would suffer in entering the house again,\\nand returning through the well-known apartments.\\n\\nin such moments anne had no power of saying to herself,\\n\"these rooms ought to belong only to us.  oh, how fallen\\nin their destination!  how unworthily occupied!  an ancient family\\nto be so driven away!  strangers filling their place!\"\\nno, except when she thought of her mother, and remembered where\\nshe had been used to sit and preside, she had no sigh of that description\\nto heave.\\n\\nmrs croft always met her with a kindness which gave her the pleasure\\nof fancying herself a favourite, and on the present occasion,\\nreceiving her in that house, there was particular attention.\\n\\nthe sad accident at lyme was soon the prevailing topic,\\nand on comparing their latest accounts of the invalid, it appeared\\nthat each lady dated her intelligence from the same hour of yestermorn;\\nthat captain wentworth had been in kellynch yesterday (the first time\\nsince the accident), had brought anne the last note, which she had\\nnot been able to trace the exact steps of; had staid a few hours\\nand then returned again to lyme, and without any present intention\\nof quitting it any more.  he had enquired after her, she found,\\nparticularly; had expressed his hope of miss elliot\\'s not being\\nthe worse for her exertions, and had spoken of those exertions as great.\\nthis was handsome, and gave her more pleasure than almost anything else\\ncould have done.\\n\\nas to the sad catastrophe itself, it could be canvassed only in one style\\nby a couple of steady, sensible women, whose judgements had to work\\non ascertained events; and it was perfectly decided that it had been\\nthe consequence of much thoughtlessness and much imprudence;\\nthat its effects were most alarming, and that it was frightful to think,\\nhow long miss musgrove\\'s recovery might yet be doubtful, and how liable\\nshe would still remain to suffer from the concussion hereafter!\\nthe admiral wound it up summarily by exclaiming--\\n\\n\"ay, a very bad business indeed.  a new sort of way this,\\nfor a young fellow to be making love, by breaking his mistress\\'s head,\\nis not it, miss elliot?  this is breaking a head and giving a plaster,\\ntruly!\"\\n\\nadmiral croft\\'s manners were not quite of the tone to suit lady russell,\\nbut they delighted anne.  his goodness of heart and simplicity\\nof character were irresistible.\\n\\n\"now, this must be very bad for you,\" said he, suddenly rousing from\\na little reverie, \"to be coming and finding us here.  i had not\\nrecollected it before, i declare, but it must be very bad.\\nbut now, do not stand upon ceremony.  get up and go over all the rooms\\nin the house if you like it.\"\\n\\n\"another time, sir, i thank you, not now.\"\\n\\n\"well, whenever it suits you.  you can slip in from the shrubbery\\nat any time; and there you will find we keep our umbrellas hanging up\\nby that door.  a good place is not it?  but,\" (checking himself),\\n\"you will not think it a good place, for yours were always kept\\nin the butler\\'s room.  ay, so it always is, i believe.\\none man\\'s ways may be as good as another\\'s, but we all like our own best.\\nand so you must judge for yourself, whether it would be better for you\\nto go about the house or not.\"\\n\\nanne, finding she might decline it, did so, very gratefully.\\n\\n\"we have made very few changes either,\" continued the admiral,\\nafter thinking a moment.  \"very few.  we told you about the laundry-door,\\nat uppercross.  that has been a very great improvement.\\nthe wonder was, how any family upon earth could bear with the inconvenience\\nof its opening as it did, so long!  you will tell sir walter\\nwhat we have done, and that mr shepherd thinks it the greatest improvement\\nthe house ever had.  indeed, i must do ourselves the justice to say,\\nthat the few alterations we have made have been all very much\\nfor the better.  my wife should have the credit of them, however.\\ni have done very little besides sending away some of the large\\nlooking-glasses from my dressing-room, which was your father\\'s.\\na very good man, and very much the gentleman i am sure:\\nbut i should think, miss elliot,\" (looking with serious reflection),\\n\"i should think he must be rather a dressy man for his time of life.\\nsuch a number of looking-glasses! oh lord! there was no getting away\\nfrom one\\'s self.  so i got sophy to lend me a hand, and we soon\\nshifted their quarters; and now i am quite snug, with my\\nlittle shaving glass in one corner, and another great thing\\nthat i never go near.\"\\n\\nanne, amused in spite of herself, was rather distressed for an answer,\\nand the admiral, fearing he might not have been civil enough,\\ntook up the subject again, to say--\\n\\n\"the next time you write to your good father, miss elliot,\\npray give him my compliments and mrs croft\\'s, and say that we are\\nsettled here quite to our liking, and have no fault at all to find\\nwith the place.  the breakfast-room chimney smokes a little,\\ni grant you, but it is only when the wind is due north and blows hard,\\nwhich may not happen three times a winter.  and take it altogether,\\nnow that we have been into most of the houses hereabouts and can judge,\\nthere is not one that we like better than this.  pray say so,\\nwith my compliments.  he will be glad to hear it.\"\\n\\nlady russell and mrs croft were very well pleased with each other:\\nbut the acquaintance which this visit began was fated not to proceed\\nfar at present; for when it was returned, the crofts announced\\nthemselves to be going away for a few weeks, to visit their connexions\\nin the north of the county, and probably might not be at home again\\nbefore lady russell would be removing to bath.\\n\\nso ended all danger to anne of meeting captain wentworth at kellynch hall,\\nor of seeing him in company with her friend.  everything was safe enough,\\nand she smiled over the many anxious feelings she had wasted\\non the subject.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 14\\n\\n\\nthough charles and mary had remained at lyme much longer after\\nmr and mrs musgrove\\'s going than anne conceived they could have been\\nat all wanted, they were yet the first of the family to be at home again;\\nand as soon as possible after their return to uppercross\\nthey drove over to the lodge.  they had left louisa beginning to sit up;\\nbut her head, though clear, was exceedingly weak, and her nerves\\nsusceptible to the highest extreme of tenderness; and though\\nshe might be pronounced to be altogether doing very well,\\nit was still impossible to say when she might be able to bear\\nthe removal home; and her father and mother, who must return\\nin time to receive their younger children for the christmas holidays,\\nhad hardly a hope of being allowed to bring her with them.\\n\\nthey had been all in lodgings together.  mrs musgrove had\\ngot mrs harville\\'s children away as much as she could, every possible\\nsupply from uppercross had been furnished, to lighten the inconvenience\\nto the harvilles, while the harvilles had been wanting them\\nto come to dinner every day; and in short, it seemed to have been\\nonly a struggle on each side as to which should be most disinterested\\nand hospitable.\\n\\nmary had had her evils; but upon the whole, as was evident\\nby her staying so long, she had found more to enjoy than to suffer.\\ncharles hayter had been at lyme oftener than suited her; and when\\nthey dined with the harvilles there had been only a maid-servant to wait,\\nand at first mrs harville had always given mrs musgrove precedence;\\nbut then, she had received so very handsome an apology from her\\non finding out whose daughter she was, and there had been so much\\ngoing on every day, there had been so many walks between their lodgings\\nand the harvilles, and she had got books from the library,\\nand changed them so often, that the balance had certainly been\\nmuch in favour of lyme.  she had been taken to charmouth too,\\nand she had bathed, and she had gone to church, and there were a great many\\nmore people to look at in the church at lyme than at uppercross;\\nand all this, joined to the sense of being so very useful,\\nhad made really an agreeable fortnight.\\n\\nanne enquired after captain benwick, mary\\'s face was clouded directly.\\ncharles laughed.\\n\\n\"oh! captain benwick is very well, i believe, but he is\\na very odd young man.  i do not know what he would be at.\\nwe asked him to come home with us for a day or two:  charles undertook\\nto give him some shooting, and he seemed quite delighted, and, for my part,\\ni thought it was all settled; when behold! on tuesday night,\\nhe made a very awkward sort of excuse; `he never shot\\' and he had\\n`been quite misunderstood,\\' and he had promised this and he had\\npromised that, and the end of it was, i found, that he did not mean to come.\\ni suppose he was afraid of finding it dull; but upon my word\\ni should have thought we were lively enough at the cottage\\nfor such a heart-broken man as captain benwick.\"\\n\\ncharles laughed again and said, \"now mary, you know very well\\nhow it really was.  it was all your doing,\" (turning to anne.)\\n\"he fancied that if he went with us, he should find you close by:\\nhe fancied everybody to be living in uppercross; and when he discovered\\nthat lady russell lived three miles off, his heart failed him,\\nand he had not courage to come.  that is the fact, upon my honour,\\nmary knows it is.\"\\n\\nbut mary did not give into it very graciously, whether from\\nnot considering captain benwick entitled by birth and situation\\nto be in love with an elliot, or from not wanting to believe\\nanne a greater attraction to uppercross than herself, must be\\nleft to be guessed.  anne\\'s good-will, however, was not to be lessened\\nby what she heard.  she boldly acknowledged herself flattered,\\nand continued her enquiries.\\n\\n\"oh! he talks of you,\" cried charles, \"in such terms--\"\\nmary interrupted him. \"i declare, charles, i never heard him\\nmention anne twice all the time i was there.  i declare, anne,\\nhe never talks of you at all.\"\\n\\n\"no,\" admitted charles, \"i do not know that he ever does, in a general\\nway; but however, it is a very clear thing that he admires you exceedingly.\\nhis head is full of some books that he is reading upon your recommendation,\\nand he wants to talk to you about them; he has found out something or other\\nin one of them which he thinks--oh! i cannot pretend to remember it,\\nbut it was something very fine--i overheard him telling henrietta\\nall about it; and then `miss elliot\\' was spoken of in the highest terms!\\nnow mary, i declare it was so, i heard it myself, and you were\\nin the other room.  `elegance, sweetness, beauty.\\' oh! there was no end\\nof miss elliot\\'s charms.\"\\n\\n\"and i am sure,\" cried mary, warmly, \"it was a very little to his credit,\\nif he did.  miss harville only died last june.  such a heart\\nis very little worth having; is it, lady russell?  i am sure\\nyou will agree with me.\"\\n\\n\"i must see captain benwick before i decide,\" said lady russell, smiling.\\n\\n\"and that you are very likely to do very soon, i can tell you, ma\\'am,\"\\nsaid charles.  \"though he had not nerves for coming away with us,\\nand setting off again afterwards to pay a formal visit here,\\nhe will make his way over to kellynch one day by himself,\\nyou may depend on it.  i told him the distance and the road,\\nand i told him of the church\\'s being so very well worth seeing;\\nfor as he has a taste for those sort of things, i thought that would\\nbe a good excuse, and he listened with all his understanding and soul;\\nand i am sure from his manner that you will have him calling here soon.\\nso, i give you notice, lady russell.\"\\n\\n\"any acquaintance of anne\\'s will always be welcome to me,\"\\nwas lady russell\\'s kind answer.\\n\\n\"oh! as to being anne\\'s acquaintance,\" said mary, \"i think he is rather\\nmy acquaintance, for i have been seeing him every day this last fortnight.\"\\n\\n\"well, as your joint acquaintance, then, i shall be very happy\\nto see captain benwick.\"\\n\\n\"you will not find anything very agreeable in him, i assure you, ma\\'am.\\nhe is one of the dullest young men that ever lived.  he has walked with me,\\nsometimes, from one end of the sands to the other, without saying a word.\\nhe is not at all a well-bred young man.  i am sure you will not like him.\"\\n\\n\"there we differ, mary,\" said anne.  \"i think lady russell would like him.\\ni think she would be so much pleased with his mind, that she would\\nvery soon see no deficiency in his manner.\"\\n\\n\"so do i, anne,\" said charles.  \"i am sure lady russell would like him.\\nhe is just lady russell\\'s sort.  give him a book, and he will\\nread all day long.\"\\n\\n\"yes, that he will!\" exclaimed mary, tauntingly.  \"he will sit poring\\nover his book, and not know when a person speaks to him, or when one\\ndrop\\'s one\\'s scissors, or anything that happens.  do you think\\nlady russell would like that?\"\\n\\nlady russell could not help laughing.  \"upon my word,\" said she,\\n\"i should not have supposed that my opinion of any one could have\\nadmitted of such difference of conjecture, steady and matter of fact\\nas i may call myself.  i have really a curiosity to see the person\\nwho can give occasion to such directly opposite notions.\\ni wish he may be induced to call here.  and when he does, mary,\\nyou may depend upon hearing my opinion; but i am determined\\nnot to judge him beforehand.\"\\n\\n\"you will not like him, i will answer for it.\"\\n\\nlady russell began talking of something else.  mary spoke with animation\\nof their meeting with, or rather missing, mr elliot so extraordinarily.\\n\\n\"he is a man,\" said lady russell, \"whom i have no wish to see.\\nhis declining to be on cordial terms with the head of his family,\\nhas left a very strong impression in his disfavour with me.\"\\n\\nthis decision checked mary\\'s eagerness, and stopped her short\\nin the midst of the elliot countenance.\\n\\nwith regard to captain wentworth, though anne hazarded no enquiries,\\nthere was voluntary communication sufficient.  his spirits had been\\ngreatly recovering lately as might be expected.  as louisa improved,\\nhe had improved, and he was now quite a different creature\\nfrom what he had been the first week.  he had not seen louisa;\\nand was so extremely fearful of any ill consequence to her\\nfrom an interview, that he did not press for it at all; and,\\non the contrary, seemed to have a plan of going away for a week\\nor ten days, till her head was stronger.  he had talked of going\\ndown to plymouth for a week, and wanted to persuade captain benwick\\nto go with him; but, as charles maintained to the last, captain benwick\\nseemed much more disposed to ride over to kellynch.\\n\\nthere can be no doubt that lady russell and anne were both\\noccasionally thinking of captain benwick, from this time.\\nlady russell could not hear the door-bell without feeling that it might\\nbe his herald; nor could anne return from any stroll of solitary indulgence\\nin her father\\'s grounds, or any visit of charity in the village,\\nwithout wondering whether she might see him or hear of him.\\ncaptain benwick came not, however.  he was either less disposed for it\\nthan charles had imagined, or he was too shy; and after giving him\\na week\\'s indulgence, lady russell determined him to be unworthy\\nof the interest which he had been beginning to excite.\\n\\nthe musgroves came back to receive their happy boys and girls from school,\\nbringing with them mrs harville\\'s little children, to improve the noise\\nof uppercross, and lessen that of lyme.  henrietta remained with louisa;\\nbut all the rest of the family were again in their usual quarters.\\n\\nlady russell and anne paid their compliments to them once,\\nwhen anne could not but feel that uppercross was already quite alive again.\\nthough neither henrietta, nor louisa, nor charles hayter,\\nnor captain wentworth were there, the room presented as strong a contrast\\nas could be wished to the last state she had seen it in.\\n\\nimmediately surrounding mrs musgrove were the little harvilles,\\nwhom she was sedulously guarding from the tyranny of the two children\\nfrom the cottage, expressly arrived to amuse them.  on one side\\nwas a table occupied by some chattering girls, cutting up silk\\nand gold paper; and on the other were tressels and trays,\\nbending under the weight of brawn and cold pies, where riotous boys\\nwere holding high revel; the whole completed by a roaring christmas fire,\\nwhich seemed determined to be heard, in spite of all the noise\\nof the others.  charles and mary also came in, of course,\\nduring their visit, and mr musgrove made a point of paying his respects\\nto lady russell, and sat down close to her for ten minutes,\\ntalking with a very raised voice, but from the clamour of the children\\non his knees, generally in vain.  it was a fine family-piece.\\n\\nanne, judging from her own temperament, would have deemed\\nsuch a domestic hurricane a bad restorative of the nerves,\\nwhich louisa\\'s illness must have so greatly shaken.  but mrs musgrove,\\nwho got anne near her on purpose to thank her most cordially,\\nagain and again, for all her attentions to them, concluded\\na short recapitulation of what she had suffered herself by observing,\\nwith a happy glance round the room, that after all she had gone through,\\nnothing was so likely to do her good as a little quiet cheerfulness\\nat home.\\n\\nlouisa was now recovering apace.  her mother could even think of her\\nbeing able to join their party at home, before her brothers and sisters\\nwent to school again.  the harvilles had promised to come with her\\nand stay at uppercross, whenever she returned.  captain wentworth was gone,\\nfor the present, to see his brother in shropshire.\\n\\n\"i hope i shall remember, in future,\" said lady russell, as soon as\\nthey were reseated in the carriage, \"not to call at uppercross\\nin the christmas holidays.\"\\n\\neverybody has their taste in noises as well as in other matters;\\nand sounds are quite innoxious, or most distressing, by their sort\\nrather than their quantity.  when lady russell not long afterwards,\\nwas entering bath on a wet afternoon, and driving through\\nthe long course of streets from the old bridge to camden place,\\namidst the dash of other carriages, the heavy rumble of carts and drays,\\nthe bawling of newspapermen, muffin-men and milkmen, and the ceaseless\\nclink of pattens, she made no complaint.  no, these were noises\\nwhich belonged to the winter pleasures; her spirits rose\\nunder their influence; and like mrs musgrove, she was feeling,\\nthough not saying, that after being long in the country, nothing could be\\nso good for her as a little quiet cheerfulness.\\n\\nanne did not share these feelings.  she persisted in a very determined,\\nthough very silent disinclination for bath; caught the first dim view\\nof the extensive buildings, smoking in rain, without any wish\\nof seeing them better; felt their progress through the streets to be,\\nhowever disagreeable, yet too rapid; for who would be glad to see her\\nwhen she arrived?  and looked back, with fond regret, to the bustles\\nof uppercross and the seclusion of kellynch.\\n\\nelizabeth\\'s last letter had communicated a piece of news of some interest.\\nmr elliot was in bath.  he had called in camden place; had called\\na second time, a third; had been pointedly attentive.  if elizabeth\\nand her father did not deceive themselves, had been taking much pains\\nto seek the acquaintance, and proclaim the value of the connection,\\nas he had formerly taken pains to shew neglect.  this was very wonderful\\nif it were true; and lady russell was in a state of very agreeable\\ncuriosity and perplexity about mr elliot, already recanting the sentiment\\nshe had so lately expressed to mary, of his being \"a man whom she had\\nno wish to see.\"  she had a great wish to see him.  if he really sought\\nto reconcile himself like a dutiful branch, he must be forgiven\\nfor having dismembered himself from the paternal tree.\\n\\nanne was not animated to an equal pitch by the circumstance,\\nbut she felt that she would rather see mr elliot again than not,\\nwhich was more than she could say for many other persons in bath.\\n\\nshe was put down in camden place; and lady russell then drove\\nto her own lodgings, in rivers street.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 15\\n\\n\\nsir walter had taken a very good house in camden place,\\na lofty dignified situation, such as becomes a man of consequence;\\nand both he and elizabeth were settled there, much to their satisfaction.\\n\\nanne entered it with a sinking heart, anticipating an imprisonment\\nof many months, and anxiously saying to herself, \"oh! when shall i\\nleave you again?\"  a degree of unexpected cordiality, however,\\nin the welcome she received, did her good.  her father and sister\\nwere glad to see her, for the sake of shewing her the house and furniture,\\nand met her with kindness.  her making a fourth, when they\\nsat down to dinner, was noticed as an advantage.\\n\\nmrs clay was very pleasant, and very smiling, but her courtesies and smiles\\nwere more a matter of course.  anne had always felt that she would\\npretend what was proper on her arrival, but the complaisance of the others\\nwas unlooked for.  they were evidently in excellent spirits,\\nand she was soon to listen to the causes.  they had no inclination\\nto listen to her.  after laying out for some compliments of being\\ndeeply regretted in their old neighbourhood, which anne could not pay,\\nthey had only a few faint enquiries to make, before the talk must be\\nall their own.  uppercross excited no interest, kellynch very little:\\nit was all bath.\\n\\nthey had the pleasure of assuring her that bath more than answered\\ntheir expectations in every respect.  their house was undoubtedly\\nthe best in camden place; their drawing-rooms had many decided advantages\\nover all the others which they had either seen or heard of,\\nand the superiority was not less in the style of the fitting-up,\\nor the taste of the furniture.  their acquaintance was\\nexceedingly sought after.  everybody was wanting to visit them.\\nthey had drawn back from many introductions, and still were\\nperpetually having cards left by people of whom they knew nothing.\\n\\nhere were funds of enjoyment.  could anne wonder that her father\\nand sister were happy?  she might not wonder, but she must sigh\\nthat her father should feel no degradation in his change, should see\\nnothing to regret in the duties and dignity of the resident landholder,\\nshould find so much to be vain of in the littlenesses of a town;\\nand she must sigh, and smile, and wonder too, as elizabeth threw open\\nthe folding-doors and walked with exultation from one drawing-room\\nto the other, boasting of their space; at the possibility of that woman,\\nwho had been mistress of kellynch hall, finding extent to be proud of\\nbetween two walls, perhaps thirty feet asunder.\\n\\nbut this was not all which they had to make them happy.\\nthey had mr elliot too.  anne had a great deal to hear of mr elliot.\\nhe was not only pardoned, they were delighted with him.\\nhe had been in bath about a fortnight; (he had passed through bath\\nin november, in his way to london, when the intelligence of\\nsir walter\\'s being settled there had of course reached him,\\nthough only twenty-four hours in the place, but he had not been able\\nto avail himself of it;) but he had now been a fortnight in bath,\\nand his first object on arriving, had been to leave his card\\nin camden place, following it up by such assiduous endeavours to meet,\\nand when they did meet, by such great openness of conduct,\\nsuch readiness to apologize for the past, such solicitude to be received\\nas a relation again, that their former good understanding\\nwas completely re-established.\\n\\nthey had not a fault to find in him.  he had explained away\\nall the appearance of neglect on his own side.  it had originated\\nin misapprehension entirely.  he had never had an idea of\\nthrowing himself off; he had feared that he was thrown off,\\nbut knew not why, and delicacy had kept him silent.  upon the hint\\nof having spoken disrespectfully or carelessly of the family\\nand the family honours, he was quite indignant.  he, who had ever boasted\\nof being an elliot, and whose feelings, as to connection,\\nwere only too strict to suit the unfeudal tone of the present day.\\nhe was astonished, indeed, but his character and general conduct\\nmust refute it.  he could refer sir walter to all who knew him;\\nand certainly, the pains he had been taking on this, the first opportunity\\nof reconciliation, to be restored to the footing of a relation\\nand heir-presumptive, was a strong proof of his opinions on the subject.\\n\\nthe circumstances of his marriage, too, were found to admit of\\nmuch extenuation.  this was an article not to be entered on by himself;\\nbut a very intimate friend of his, a colonel wallis, a highly\\nrespectable man, perfectly the gentleman, (and not an ill-looking man,\\nsir walter added), who was living in very good style in marlborough\\nbuildings, and had, at his own particular request, been admitted\\nto their acquaintance through mr elliot, had mentioned one or two things\\nrelative to the marriage, which made a material difference\\nin the discredit of it.\\n\\ncolonel wallis had known mr elliot long, had been well acquainted\\nalso with his wife, had perfectly understood the whole story.\\nshe was certainly not a woman of family, but well educated,\\naccomplished, rich, and excessively in love with his friend.\\nthere had been the charm.  she had sought him.  without that attraction,\\nnot all her money would have tempted elliot, and sir walter was,\\nmoreover, assured of her having been a very fine woman.\\nhere was a great deal to soften the business.  a very fine woman\\nwith a large fortune, in love with him!  sir walter seemed to admit it\\nas complete apology; and though elizabeth could not see the circumstance\\nin quite so favourable a light, she allowed it be a great extenuation.\\n\\nmr elliot had called repeatedly, had dined with them once,\\nevidently delighted by the distinction of being asked, for they\\ngave no dinners in general; delighted, in short, by every proof\\nof cousinly notice, and placing his whole happiness in being\\non intimate terms in camden place.\\n\\nanne listened, but without quite understanding it.  allowances,\\nlarge allowances, she knew, must be made for the ideas of those who spoke.\\nshe heard it all under embellishment.  all that sounded extravagant\\nor irrational in the progress of the reconciliation might have no origin\\nbut in the language of the relators.  still, however, she had\\nthe sensation of there being something more than immediately appeared,\\nin mr elliot\\'s wishing, after an interval of so many years,\\nto be well received by them.  in a worldly view, he had nothing to gain\\nby being on terms with sir walter; nothing to risk by a state of variance.\\nin all probability he was already the richer of the two,\\nand the kellynch estate would as surely be his hereafter as the title.\\na sensible man, and he had looked like a very sensible man,\\nwhy should it be an object to him?  she could only offer one solution;\\nit was, perhaps, for elizabeth\\'s sake.  there might really have been\\na liking formerly, though convenience and accident had drawn him\\na different way; and now that he could afford to please himself,\\nhe might mean to pay his addresses to her.  elizabeth was certainly\\nvery handsome, with well-bred, elegant manners, and her character\\nmight never have been penetrated by mr elliot, knowing her but in public,\\nand when very young himself.  how her temper and understanding\\nmight bear the investigation of his present keener time of life\\nwas another concern and rather a fearful one.  most earnestly did she wish\\nthat he might not be too nice, or too observant if elizabeth\\nwere his object; and that elizabeth was disposed to believe herself so,\\nand that her friend mrs clay was encouraging the idea, seemed apparent\\nby a glance or two between them, while mr elliot\\'s frequent visits\\nwere talked of.\\n\\nanne mentioned the glimpses she had had of him at lyme, but without\\nbeing much attended to.  \"oh! yes, perhaps, it had been mr elliot.\\nthey did not know.  it might be him, perhaps.\"  they could not listen\\nto her description of him.  they were describing him themselves;\\nsir walter especially.  he did justice to his very gentlemanlike\\nappearance, his air of elegance and fashion, his good shaped face,\\nhis sensible eye; but, at the same time, \"must lament his being\\nvery much under-hung, a defect which time seemed to have increased;\\nnor could he pretend to say that ten years had not altered\\nalmost every feature for the worse.  mr elliot appeared to think\\nthat he (sir walter) was looking exactly as he had done when\\nthey last parted;\" but sir walter had \"not been able to return\\nthe compliment entirely, which had embarrassed him.  he did not mean\\nto complain, however.  mr elliot was better to look at than most men,\\nand he had no objection to being seen with him anywhere.\"\\n\\nmr elliot, and his friends in marlborough buildings, were talked of\\nthe whole evening.  \"colonel wallis had been so impatient to be\\nintroduced to them! and mr elliot so anxious that he should!\"\\nand there was a mrs wallis, at present known only to them by description,\\nas she was in daily expectation of her confinement; but mr elliot\\nspoke of her as \"a most charming woman, quite worthy of being known\\nin camden place,\" and as soon as she recovered they were to be acquainted.\\nsir walter thought much of mrs wallis; she was said to be\\nan excessively pretty woman, beautiful.  \"he longed to see her.\\nhe hoped she might make some amends for the many very plain faces\\nhe was continually passing in the streets.  the worst of bath was\\nthe number of its plain women.  he did not mean to say that there were\\nno pretty women, but the number of the plain was out of all proportion.\\nhe had frequently observed, as he walked, that one handsome face\\nwould be followed by thirty, or five-and-thirty frights; and once,\\nas he had stood in a shop on bond street, he had counted\\neighty-seven women go by, one after another, without there being\\na tolerable face among them.  it had been a frosty morning,\\nto be sure, a sharp frost, which hardly one woman in a thousand\\ncould stand the test of.  but still, there certainly were\\na dreadful multitude of ugly women in bath; and as for the men!\\nthey were infinitely worse.  such scarecrows as the streets were full of!\\nit was evident how little the women were used to the sight of anything\\ntolerable, by the effect which a man of decent appearance produced.\\nhe had never walked anywhere arm-in-arm with colonel wallis\\n(who was a fine military figure, though sandy-haired) without observing\\nthat every woman\\'s eye was upon him; every woman\\'s eye was sure to be\\nupon colonel wallis.\"  modest sir walter!  he was not allowed\\nto escape, however.  his daughter and mrs clay united in hinting\\nthat colonel wallis\\'s companion might have as good a figure\\nas colonel wallis, and certainly was not sandy-haired.\\n\\n\"how is mary looking?\" said sir walter, in the height of his good humour.\\n\"the last time i saw her she had a red nose, but i hope that may not\\nhappen every day.\"\\n\\n\"oh! no, that must have been quite accidental.  in general she has been\\nin very good health and very good looks since michaelmas.\"\\n\\n\"if i thought it would not tempt her to go out in sharp winds,\\nand grow coarse, i would send her a new hat and pelisse.\"\\n\\nanne was considering whether she should venture to suggest that a gown,\\nor a cap, would not be liable to any such misuse, when a knock at the door\\nsuspended everything.  \"a knock at the door! and so late!\\nit was ten o\\'clock.  could it be mr elliot?  they knew he was to dine\\nin lansdown crescent.  it was possible that he might stop in his way home\\nto ask them how they did.  they could think of no one else.\\nmrs clay decidedly thought it mr elliot\\'s knock.\"  mrs clay was right.\\nwith all the state which a butler and foot-boy could give,\\nmr elliot was ushered into the room.\\n\\nit was the same, the very same man, with no difference but of dress.\\nanne drew a little back, while the others received his compliments,\\nand her sister his apologies for calling at so unusual an hour,\\nbut \"he could not be so near without wishing to know that neither she\\nnor her friend had taken cold the day before,\" &c. &c; which was\\nall as politely done, and as politely taken, as possible, but her part\\nmust follow then.  sir walter talked of his youngest daughter;\\n\"mr elliot must give him leave to present him to his youngest daughter\"\\n(there was no occasion for remembering mary); and anne, smiling and\\nblushing, very becomingly shewed to mr elliot the pretty features\\nwhich he had by no means forgotten, and instantly saw, with amusement\\nat his little start of surprise, that he had not been at all aware\\nof who she was.  he looked completely astonished, but not more astonished\\nthan pleased; his eyes brightened! and with the most perfect alacrity\\nhe welcomed the relationship, alluded to the past, and entreated\\nto be received as an acquaintance already.  he was quite as good-looking\\nas he had appeared at lyme, his countenance improved by speaking,\\nand his manners were so exactly what they ought to be, so polished,\\nso easy, so particularly agreeable, that she could compare them\\nin excellence to only one person\\'s manners.  they were not the same,\\nbut they were, perhaps, equally good.\\n\\nhe sat down with them, and improved their conversation very much.\\nthere could be no doubt of his being a sensible man.  ten minutes\\nwere enough to certify that.  his tone, his expressions,\\nhis choice of subject, his knowing where to stop; it was all\\nthe operation of a sensible, discerning mind.  as soon as he could,\\nhe began to talk to her of lyme, wanting to compare opinions\\nrespecting the place, but especially wanting to speak of the circumstance\\nof their happening to be guests in the same inn at the same time;\\nto give his own route, understand something of hers, and regret that\\nhe should have lost such an opportunity of paying his respects to her.\\nshe gave him a short account of her party and business at lyme.\\nhis regret increased as he listened.  he had spent his whole\\nsolitary evening in the room adjoining theirs; had heard voices,\\nmirth continually; thought they must be a most delightful set of people,\\nlonged to be with them, but certainly without the smallest suspicion\\nof his possessing the shadow of a right to introduce himself.\\nif he had but asked who the party were!  the name of musgrove would\\nhave told him enough.  \"well, it would serve to cure him of\\nan absurd practice of never asking a question at an inn,\\nwhich he had adopted, when quite a young man, on the principal\\nof its being very ungenteel to be curious.\\n\\n\"the notions of a young man of one or two and twenty,\" said he,\\n\"as to what is necessary in manners to make him quite the thing,\\nare more absurd, i believe, than those of any other set of beings\\nin the world.  the folly of the means they often employ\\nis only to be equalled by the folly of what they have in view.\"\\n\\nbut he must not be addressing his reflections to anne alone:\\nhe knew it; he was soon diffused again among the others,\\nand it was only at intervals that he could return to lyme.\\n\\nhis enquiries, however, produced at length an account of the scene\\nshe had been engaged in there, soon after his leaving the place.\\nhaving alluded to \"an accident,\"  he must hear the whole.\\nwhen he questioned, sir walter and elizabeth began to question also,\\nbut the difference in their manner of doing it could not be unfelt.\\nshe could only compare mr elliot to lady russell, in the wish\\nof really comprehending what had passed, and in the degree of concern\\nfor what she must have suffered in witnessing it.\\n\\nhe staid an hour with them.  the elegant little clock on the mantel-\\npiece had struck \"eleven with its silver sounds,\" and the watchman\\nwas beginning to be heard at a distance telling the same tale,\\nbefore mr elliot or any of them seemed to feel that he had been there long.\\n\\nanne could not have supposed it possible that her first evening in\\ncamden place could have passed so well!\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 16\\n\\n\\nthere was one point which anne, on returning to her family,\\nwould have been more thankful to ascertain even than mr elliot\\'s\\nbeing in love with elizabeth, which was, her father\\'s not being\\nin love with mrs clay; and she was very far from easy about it,\\nwhen she had been at home a few hours.  on going down to breakfast\\nthe next morning, she found there had just been a decent pretence\\non the lady\\'s side of meaning to leave them.  she could imagine mrs clay\\nto have said, that \"now miss anne was come, she could not suppose herself\\nat all wanted;\" for elizabeth was replying in a sort of whisper,\\n\"that must not be any reason, indeed.  i assure you i feel it none.\\nshe is nothing to me, compared with you;\"  and she was in full time\\nto hear her father say, \"my dear madam, this must not be.  as yet,\\nyou have seen nothing of bath.  you have been here only to be useful.\\nyou must not run away from us now.  you must stay to be acquainted\\nwith mrs wallis, the beautiful mrs wallis.  to your fine mind,\\ni well know the sight of beauty is a real gratification.\"\\n\\nhe spoke and looked so much in earnest, that anne was not surprised\\nto see mrs clay stealing a glance at elizabeth and herself.\\nher countenance, perhaps, might express some watchfulness;\\nbut the praise of the fine mind did not appear to excite a thought\\nin her sister.  the lady could not but yield to such joint entreaties,\\nand promise to stay.\\n\\nin the course of the same morning, anne and her father chancing to be\\nalone together, he began to compliment her on her improved looks;\\nhe thought her \"less thin in her person, in her cheeks; her skin,\\nher complexion, greatly improved; clearer, fresher.  had she been\\nusing any thing in particular?\"  \"no, nothing.\"  \"merely gowland,\"\\nhe supposed.  \"no, nothing at all.\"  \"ha! he was surprised at that;\"\\nand added, \"certainly you cannot do better than to continue as you are;\\nyou cannot be better than well; or i should recommend gowland,\\nthe constant use of gowland, during the spring months.  mrs clay has been\\nusing it at my recommendation, and you see what it has done for her.\\nyou see how it has carried away her freckles.\"\\n\\nif elizabeth could but have heard this!  such personal praise\\nmight have struck her, especially as it did not appear to anne\\nthat the freckles were at all lessened.  but everything must\\ntake its chance.  the evil of a marriage would be much diminished,\\nif elizabeth were also to marry.  as for herself, she might always\\ncommand a home with lady russell.\\n\\nlady russell\\'s composed mind and polite manners were put to some trial\\non this point, in her intercourse in camden place.  the sight of mrs clay\\nin such favour, and of anne so overlooked, was a perpetual provocation\\nto her there; and vexed her as much when she was away, as a person in bath\\nwho drinks the water, gets all the new publications, and has\\na very large acquaintance, has time to be vexed.\\n\\nas mr elliot became known to her, she grew more charitable,\\nor more indifferent, towards the others.  his manners were\\nan immediate recommendation; and on conversing with him she found\\nthe solid so fully supporting the superficial, that she was at first,\\nas she told anne, almost ready to exclaim, \"can this be mr elliot?\"\\nand could not seriously picture to herself a more agreeable\\nor estimable man.  everything united in him; good understanding,\\ncorrect opinions, knowledge of the world, and a warm heart.\\nhe had strong feelings of family attachment and family honour,\\nwithout pride or weakness; he lived with the liberality of a man of fortune,\\nwithout display; he judged for himself in everything essential,\\nwithout defying public opinion in any point of worldly decorum.\\nhe was steady, observant, moderate, candid; never run away with by spirits\\nor by selfishness, which fancied itself strong feeling; and yet,\\nwith a sensibility to what was amiable and lovely, and a value\\nfor all the felicities of domestic life, which characters of\\nfancied enthusiasm and violent agitation seldom really possess.\\nshe was sure that he had not been happy in marriage.  colonel wallis\\nsaid it, and lady russell saw it; but it had been no unhappiness\\nto sour his mind, nor (she began pretty soon to suspect) to prevent his\\nthinking of a second choice.  her satisfaction in mr elliot\\noutweighed all the plague of mrs clay.\\n\\nit was now some years since anne had begun to learn that she\\nand her excellent friend could sometimes think differently;\\nand it did not surprise her, therefore, that lady russell\\nshould see nothing suspicious or inconsistent, nothing to require\\nmore motives than appeared, in mr elliot\\'s great desire of a reconciliation.\\nin lady russell\\'s view, it was perfectly natural that mr elliot,\\nat a mature time of life, should feel it a most desirable object,\\nand what would very generally recommend him among all sensible people,\\nto be on good terms with the head of his family; the simplest process\\nin the world of time upon a head naturally clear, and only erring\\nin the heyday of youth.  anne presumed, however, still to smile about it,\\nand at last to mention \"elizabeth.\"  lady russell listened, and looked,\\nand made only this cautious reply:--\"elizabeth! very well;\\ntime will explain.\"\\n\\nit was a reference to the future, which anne, after a little observation,\\nfelt she must submit to.  she could determine nothing at present.\\nin that house elizabeth must be first; and she was in the habit\\nof such general observance as \"miss elliot,\" that any particularity\\nof attention seemed almost impossible.  mr elliot, too,\\nit must be remembered, had not been a widower seven months.\\na little delay on his side might be very excusable.  in fact,\\nanne could never see the crape round his hat, without fearing that\\nshe was the inexcusable one, in attributing to him such imaginations;\\nfor though his marriage had not been very happy, still it had existed\\nso many years that she could not comprehend a very rapid recovery\\nfrom the awful impression of its being dissolved.\\n\\nhowever it might end, he was without any question their\\npleasantest acquaintance in bath:  she saw nobody equal to him;\\nand it was a great indulgence now and then to talk to him about lyme,\\nwhich he seemed to have as lively a wish to see again, and to see more of,\\nas herself.  they went through the particulars of their first meeting\\na great many times.  he gave her to understand that he had\\nlooked at her with some earnestness.  she knew it well;\\nand she remembered another person\\'s look also.\\n\\nthey did not always think alike.  his value for rank and connexion\\nshe perceived was greater than hers.  it was not merely complaisance,\\nit must be a liking to the cause, which made him enter warmly\\ninto her father and sister\\'s solicitudes on a subject which\\nshe thought unworthy to excite them.  the bath paper one morning\\nannounced the arrival of the dowager viscountess dalrymple,\\nand her daughter, the honourable miss carteret; and all the comfort\\nof no.--, camden place, was swept away for many days; for the dalrymples\\n(in anne\\'s opinion, most unfortunately) were cousins of the elliots;\\nand the agony was how to introduce themselves properly.\\n\\nanne had never seen her father and sister before in contact with nobility,\\nand she must acknowledge herself disappointed.  she had hoped\\nbetter things from their high ideas of their own situation in life,\\nand was reduced to form a wish which she had never foreseen;\\na wish that they had more pride; for \"our cousins lady dalrymple\\nand miss carteret;\" \"our cousins, the dalrymples,\" sounded in her ears\\nall day long.\\n\\nsir walter had once been in company with the late viscount,\\nbut had never seen any of the rest of the family; and the difficulties\\nof the case arose from there having been a suspension of all intercourse\\nby letters of ceremony, ever since the death of that said late viscount,\\nwhen, in consequence of a dangerous illness of sir walter\\'s\\nat the same time, there had been an unlucky omission at kellynch.\\nno letter of condolence had been sent to ireland.  the neglect\\nhad been visited on the head of the sinner; for when poor lady elliot\\ndied herself, no letter of condolence was received at kellynch,\\nand, consequently, there was but too much reason to apprehend\\nthat the dalrymples considered the relationship as closed.\\nhow to have this anxious business set to rights, and be admitted\\nas cousins again, was the question:  and it was a question which,\\nin a more rational manner, neither lady russell nor mr elliot\\nthought unimportant.  \"family connexions were always worth preserving,\\ngood company always worth seeking; lady dalrymple had taken a house,\\nfor three months, in laura place, and would be living in style.\\nshe had been at bath the year before, and lady russell had heard her\\nspoken of as a charming woman.  it was very desirable that\\nthe connexion should be renewed, if it could be done, without any\\ncompromise of propriety on the side of the elliots.\"\\n\\nsir walter, however, would choose his own means, and at last wrote\\na very fine letter of ample explanation, regret, and entreaty,\\nto his right honourable cousin.  neither lady russell nor mr elliot\\ncould admire the letter; but it did all that was wanted,\\nin bringing three lines of scrawl from the dowager viscountess.\\n\"she was very much honoured, and should be happy in their acquaintance.\"\\nthe toils of the business were over, the sweets began.  they visited\\nin laura place, they had the cards of dowager viscountess dalrymple,\\nand the honourable miss carteret, to be arranged wherever they might\\nbe most visible:  and \"our cousins in laura place,\"--\"our cousin,\\nlady dalrymple and miss carteret,\" were talked of to everybody.\\n\\nanne was ashamed.  had lady dalrymple and her daughter even been\\nvery agreeable, she would still have been ashamed of the agitation\\nthey created, but they were nothing.  there was no superiority of manner,\\naccomplishment, or understanding.  lady dalrymple had acquired\\nthe name of \"a charming woman,\" because she had a smile and a civil answer\\nfor everybody.  miss carteret, with still less to say, was so plain\\nand so awkward, that she would never have been tolerated in camden place\\nbut for her birth.\\n\\nlady russell confessed she had expected something better; but yet\\n\"it was an acquaintance worth having;\" and when anne ventured to speak\\nher opinion of them to mr elliot, he agreed to their being nothing\\nin themselves, but still maintained that, as a family connexion,\\nas good company, as those who would collect good company around them,\\nthey had their value.  anne smiled and said,\\n\\n\"my idea of good company, mr elliot, is the company of clever,\\nwell-informed people, who have a great deal of conversation;\\nthat is what i call good company.\"\\n\\n\"you are mistaken,\" said he gently, \"that is not good company;\\nthat is the best.  good company requires only birth, education,\\nand manners, and with regard to education is not very nice.\\nbirth and good manners are essential; but a little learning is\\nby no means a dangerous thing in good company; on the contrary,\\nit will do very well.  my cousin anne shakes her head.\\nshe is not satisfied.  she is fastidious.  my dear cousin\"\\n(sitting down by her), \"you have a better right to be fastidious\\nthan almost any other woman i know; but will it answer?\\nwill it make you happy?  will it not be wiser to accept the society\\nof those good ladies in laura place, and enjoy all the advantages\\nof the connexion as far as possible?  you may depend upon it,\\nthat they will move in the first set in bath this winter,\\nand as rank is rank, your being known to be related to them\\nwill have its use in fixing your family (our family let me say)\\nin that degree of consideration which we must all wish for.\"\\n\\n\"yes,\" sighed anne, \"we shall, indeed, be known to be related to them!\"\\nthen recollecting herself, and not wishing to be answered, she added,\\n\"i certainly do think there has been by far too much trouble taken\\nto procure the acquaintance.  i suppose\" (smiling) \"i have more pride\\nthan any of you; but i confess it does vex me, that we should be\\nso solicitous to have the relationship acknowledged, which we may\\nbe very sure is a matter of perfect indifference to them.\"\\n\\n\"pardon me, dear cousin, you are unjust in your own claims.\\nin london, perhaps, in your present quiet style of living,\\nit might be as you say:  but in bath; sir walter elliot and his family\\nwill always be worth knowing:  always acceptable as acquaintance.\"\\n\\n\"well,\" said anne, \"i certainly am proud, too proud to enjoy a welcome\\nwhich depends so entirely upon place.\"\\n\\n\"i love your indignation,\" said he; \"it is very natural.\\nbut here you are in bath, and the object is to be established here\\nwith all the credit and dignity which ought to belong to sir walter elliot.\\nyou talk of being proud; i am called proud, i know, and i shall not wish\\nto believe myself otherwise; for our pride, if investigated,\\nwould have the same object, i have no doubt, though the kind may seem\\na little different.  in one point, i am sure, my dear cousin,\"\\n(he continued, speaking lower, though there was no one else in the room)\\n\"in one point, i am sure, we must feel alike.  we must feel that\\nevery addition to your father\\'s society, among his equals or superiors,\\nmay be of use in diverting his thoughts from those who are beneath him.\"\\n\\nhe looked, as he spoke, to the seat which mrs clay had been\\nlately occupying:  a sufficient explanation of what he particularly meant;\\nand though anne could not believe in their having the same sort of pride,\\nshe was pleased with him for not liking mrs clay; and her conscience\\nadmitted that his wishing to promote her father\\'s getting\\ngreat acquaintance was more than excusable in the view of defeating her.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 17\\n\\n\\nwhile sir walter and elizabeth were assiduously pushing their\\ngood fortune in laura place, anne was renewing an acquaintance\\nof a very different description.\\n\\nshe had called on her former governess, and had heard from her\\nof there being an old school-fellow in bath, who had the two strong claims\\non her attention of past kindness and present suffering.  miss hamilton,\\nnow mrs smith, had shewn her kindness in one of those periods of her life\\nwhen it had been most valuable.  anne had gone unhappy to school,\\ngrieving for the loss of a mother whom she had dearly loved,\\nfeeling her separation from home, and suffering as a girl of fourteen,\\nof strong sensibility and not high spirits, must suffer at such a time;\\nand miss hamilton, three years older than herself, but still from the want\\nof near relations and a settled home, remaining another year at school,\\nhad been useful and good to her in a way which had considerably lessened\\nher misery, and could never be remembered with indifference.\\n\\nmiss hamilton had left school, had married not long afterwards,\\nwas said to have married a man of fortune, and this was all\\nthat anne had known of her, till now that their governess\\'s account\\nbrought her situation forward in a more decided but very different form.\\n\\nshe was a widow and poor.  her husband had been extravagant;\\nand at his death, about two years before, had left his affairs\\ndreadfully involved.  she had had difficulties of every sort\\nto contend with, and in addition to these distresses had been afflicted\\nwith a severe rheumatic fever, which, finally settling in her legs,\\nhad made her for the present a cripple.  she had come to bath\\non that account, and was now in lodgings near the hot baths,\\nliving in a very humble way, unable even to afford herself\\nthe comfort of a servant, and of course almost excluded from society.\\n\\ntheir mutual friend answered for the satisfaction which a visit\\nfrom miss elliot would give mrs smith, and anne therefore\\nlost no time in going.  she mentioned nothing of what she had heard,\\nor what she intended, at home.  it would excite no proper interest there.\\nshe only consulted lady russell, who entered thoroughly into her sentiments,\\nand was most happy to convey her as near to mrs smith\\'s lodgings\\nin westgate buildings, as anne chose to be taken.\\n\\nthe visit was paid, their acquaintance re-established, their interest\\nin each other more than re-kindled.  the first ten minutes\\nhad its awkwardness and its emotion.  twelve years were gone\\nsince they had parted, and each presented a somewhat different person\\nfrom what the other had imagined.  twelve years had changed anne\\nfrom the blooming, silent, unformed girl of fifteen, to the elegant\\nlittle woman of seven-and-twenty, with every beauty except bloom,\\nand with manners as consciously right as they were invariably gentle;\\nand twelve years had transformed the fine-looking, well-grown miss hamilton,\\nin all the glow of health and confidence of superiority, into a poor,\\ninfirm, helpless widow, receiving the visit of her former protegee\\nas a favour; but all that was uncomfortable in the meeting had soon\\npassed away, and left only the interesting charm of remembering\\nformer partialities and talking over old times.\\n\\nanne found in mrs smith the good sense and agreeable manners which\\nshe had almost ventured to depend on, and a disposition to converse\\nand be cheerful beyond her expectation.  neither the dissipations\\nof the past--and she had lived very much in the world--nor the restrictions\\nof the present, neither sickness nor sorrow seemed to have\\nclosed her heart or ruined her spirits.\\n\\nin the course of a second visit she talked with great openness,\\nand anne\\'s astonishment increased.  she could scarcely imagine\\na more cheerless situation in itself than mrs smith\\'s.  she had been\\nvery fond of her husband:  she had buried him.  she had been\\nused to affluence:  it was gone.  she had no child to connect her\\nwith life and happiness again, no relations to assist in the arrangement\\nof perplexed affairs, no health to make all the rest supportable.\\nher accommodations were limited to a noisy parlour, and a dark bedroom\\nbehind, with no possibility of moving from one to the other without\\nassistance, which there was only one servant in the house to afford,\\nand she never quitted the house but to be conveyed into the warm bath.\\nyet, in spite of all this, anne had reason to believe that she had\\nmoments only of languor and depression, to hours of occupation\\nand enjoyment.  how could it be?  she watched, observed, reflected,\\nand finally determined that this was not a case of fortitude\\nor of resignation only.  a submissive spirit might be patient,\\na strong understanding would supply resolution, but here was something more;\\nhere was that elasticity of mind, that disposition to be comforted,\\nthat power of turning readily from evil to good, and of finding employment\\nwhich carried her out of herself, which was from nature alone.\\nit was the choicest gift of heaven; and anne viewed her friend\\nas one of those instances in which, by a merciful appointment,\\nit seems designed to counterbalance almost every other want.\\n\\nthere had been a time, mrs smith told her, when her spirits\\nhad nearly failed.  she could not call herself an invalid now,\\ncompared with her state on first reaching bath.  then she had, indeed,\\nbeen a pitiable object; for she had caught cold on the journey,\\nand had hardly taken possession of her lodgings before she was again\\nconfined to her bed and suffering under severe and constant pain;\\nand all this among strangers, with the absolute necessity of having\\na regular nurse, and finances at that moment particularly unfit\\nto meet any extraordinary expense.  she had weathered it, however,\\nand could truly say that it had done her good.  it had increased\\nher comforts by making her feel herself to be in good hands.\\nshe had seen too much of the world, to expect sudden or disinterested\\nattachment anywhere, but her illness had proved to her that her landlady\\nhad a character to preserve, and would not use her ill; and she had been\\nparticularly fortunate in her nurse, as a sister of her landlady,\\na nurse by profession, and who had always a home in that house\\nwhen unemployed, chanced to be at liberty just in time to attend her.\\n\"and she,\" said mrs smith, \"besides nursing me most admirably,\\nhas really proved an invaluable acquaintance.  as soon as i could\\nuse my hands she taught me to knit, which has been a great amusement;\\nand she put me in the way of making these little thread-cases,\\npin-cushions and card-racks, which you always find me so busy about,\\nand which supply me with the means of doing a little good\\nto one or two very poor families in this neighbourhood.\\nshe had a large acquaintance, of course professionally, among those\\nwho can afford to buy, and she disposes of my merchandise.\\nshe always takes the right time for applying.  everybody\\'s heart is open,\\nyou know, when they have recently escaped from severe pain,\\nor are recovering the blessing of health, and nurse rooke\\nthoroughly understands when to speak.  she is a shrewd, intelligent,\\nsensible woman.  hers is a line for seeing human nature; and she has\\na fund of good sense and observation, which, as a companion, make her\\ninfinitely superior to thousands of those who having only received\\n`the best education in the world,\\' know nothing worth attending to.\\ncall it gossip, if you will, but when nurse rooke has half an hour\\'s\\nleisure to bestow on me, she is sure to have something to relate\\nthat is entertaining and profitable:  something that makes one\\nknow one\\'s species better.  one likes to hear what is going on,\\nto be au fait as to the newest modes of being trifling and silly.\\nto me, who live so much alone, her conversation, i assure you, is a treat.\"\\n\\nanne, far from wishing to cavil at the pleasure, replied,\\n\"i can easily believe it.  women of that class have great opportunities,\\nand if they are intelligent may be well worth listening to.\\nsuch varieties of human nature as they are in the habit of witnessing!\\nand it is not merely in its follies, that they are well read;\\nfor they see it occasionally under every circumstance that can be\\nmost interesting or affecting.  what instances must pass before them\\nof ardent, disinterested, self-denying attachment, of heroism, fortitude,\\npatience, resignation:  of all the conflicts and all the sacrifices\\nthat ennoble us most.  a sick chamber may often furnish\\nthe worth of volumes.\"\\n\\n\"yes,\" said mrs smith more doubtingly, \"sometimes it may,\\nthough i fear its lessons are not often in the elevated style you describe.\\nhere and there, human nature may be great in times of trial;\\nbut generally speaking, it is its weakness and not its strength\\nthat appears in a sick chamber:  it is selfishness and impatience\\nrather than generosity and fortitude, that one hears of.\\nthere is so little real friendship in the world! and unfortunately\"\\n(speaking low and tremulously) \"there are so many who forget\\nto think seriously till it is almost too late.\"\\n\\nanne saw the misery of such feelings.  the husband had not been\\nwhat he ought, and the wife had been led among that part of mankind\\nwhich made her think worse of the world than she hoped it deserved.\\nit was but a passing emotion however with mrs smith; she shook it off,\\nand soon added in a different tone--\\n\\n\"i do not suppose the situation my friend mrs rooke is in at present,\\nwill furnish much either to interest or edify me.  she is only nursing\\nmrs wallis of marlborough buildings; a mere pretty, silly, expensive,\\nfashionable woman, i believe; and of course will have nothing to report\\nbut of lace and finery.  i mean to make my profit of mrs wallis, however.\\nshe has plenty of money, and i intend she shall buy all\\nthe high-priced things i have in hand now.\"\\n\\nanne had called several times on her friend, before the existence\\nof such a person was known in camden place.  at last, it became necessary\\nto speak of her. sir walter, elizabeth and mrs clay, returned one morning\\nfrom laura place, with a sudden invitation from lady dalrymple\\nfor the same evening, and anne was already engaged, to spend that evening\\nin westgate buildings.  she was not sorry for the excuse.\\nthey were only asked, she was sure, because lady dalrymple being\\nkept at home by a bad cold, was glad to make use of the relationship\\nwhich had been so pressed on her; and she declined on her own account\\nwith great alacrity--\"she was engaged to spend the evening\\nwith an old schoolfellow.\"  they were not much interested in anything\\nrelative to anne; but still there were questions enough asked,\\nto make it understood what this old schoolfellow was; and elizabeth\\nwas disdainful, and sir walter severe.\\n\\n\"westgate buildings!\" said he, \"and who is miss anne elliot\\nto be visiting in westgate buildings?  a mrs smith.  a widow mrs smith;\\nand who was her husband?  one of five thousand mr smiths whose names\\nare to be met with everywhere.  and what is her attraction?\\nthat she is old and sickly.  upon my word, miss anne elliot,\\nyou have the most extraordinary taste!  everything that revolts\\nother people, low company, paltry rooms, foul air, disgusting associations\\nare inviting to you.  but surely you may put off this old lady\\ntill to-morrow:  she is not so near her end, i presume,\\nbut that she may hope to see another day.  what is her age?  forty?\"\\n\\n\"no, sir, she is not one-and-thirty; but i do not think i can\\nput off my engagement, because it is the only evening for some time\\nwhich will at once suit her and myself.  she goes into the warm bath\\nto-morrow, and for the rest of the week, you know, we are engaged.\"\\n\\n\"but what does lady russell think of this acquaintance?\" asked elizabeth.\\n\\n\"she sees nothing to blame in it,\" replied anne; \"on the contrary,\\nshe approves it, and has generally taken me when i have\\ncalled on mrs smith.\\n\\n\"westgate buildings must have been rather surprised by the appearance\\nof a carriage drawn up near its pavement,\" observed sir walter.\\n\"sir henry russell\\'s widow, indeed, has no honours to distinguish her arms,\\nbut still it is a handsome equipage, and no doubt is well known\\nto convey a miss elliot.  a widow mrs smith lodging in westgate buildings!\\na poor widow barely able to live, between thirty and forty;\\na mere mrs smith, an every-day mrs smith, of all people and all names\\nin the world, to be the chosen friend of miss anne elliot,\\nand to be preferred by her to her own family connections among the nobility\\nof england and ireland!  mrs smith!  such a name!\"\\n\\nmrs clay, who had been present while all this passed, now thought it\\nadvisable to leave the room, and anne could have said much,\\nand did long to say a little in defence of her friend\\'s\\nnot very dissimilar claims to theirs, but her sense of personal respect\\nto her father prevented her.  she made no reply.  she left it\\nto himself to recollect, that mrs smith was not the only widow\\nin bath between thirty and forty, with little to live on,\\nand no surname of dignity.\\n\\nanne kept her appointment; the others kept theirs, and of course\\nshe heard the next morning that they had had a delightful evening.\\nshe had been the only one of the set absent, for sir walter\\nand elizabeth had not only been quite at her ladyship\\'s service themselves,\\nbut had actually been happy to be employed by her in collecting others,\\nand had been at the trouble of inviting both lady russell and mr elliot;\\nand mr elliot had made a point of leaving colonel wallis early,\\nand lady russell had fresh arranged all her evening engagements\\nin order to wait on her.  anne had the whole history of all that\\nsuch an evening could supply from lady russell.  to her,\\nits greatest interest must be, in having been very much talked of\\nbetween her friend and mr elliot; in having been wished for, regretted,\\nand at the same time honoured for staying away in such a cause.\\nher kind, compassionate visits to this old schoolfellow,\\nsick and reduced, seemed to have quite delighted mr elliot.\\nhe thought her a most extraordinary young woman; in her temper, manners,\\nmind, a model of female excellence.  he could meet even lady russell\\nin a discussion of her merits; and anne could not be given to understand\\nso much by her friend, could not know herself to be so highly rated\\nby a sensible man, without many of those agreeable sensations\\nwhich her friend meant to create.\\n\\nlady russell was now perfectly decided in her opinion of mr elliot.\\nshe was as much convinced of his meaning to gain anne in time as of\\nhis deserving her, and was beginning to calculate the number of weeks\\nwhich would free him from all the remaining restraints of widowhood,\\nand leave him at liberty to exert his most open powers of pleasing.\\nshe would not speak to anne with half the certainty she felt on the subject,\\nshe would venture on little more than hints of what might be hereafter,\\nof a possible attachment on his side, of the desirableness of the alliance,\\nsupposing such attachment to be real and returned.  anne heard her,\\nand made no violent exclamations; she only smiled, blushed,\\nand gently shook her head.\\n\\n\"i am no match-maker, as you well know,\" said lady russell,\\n\"being much too well aware of the uncertainty of all human events\\nand calculations.  i only mean that if mr elliot should some time hence\\npay his addresses to you, and if you should be disposed to accept him,\\ni think there would be every possibility of your being happy together.\\na most suitable connection everybody must consider it, but i think\\nit might be a very happy one.\"\\n\\n\"mr elliot is an exceedingly agreeable man, and in many respects\\ni think highly of him,\" said anne; \"but we should not suit.\"\\n\\nlady russell let this pass, and only said in rejoinder, \"i own that\\nto be able to regard you as the future mistress of kellynch,\\nthe future lady elliot, to look forward and see you occupying\\nyour dear mother\\'s place, succeeding to all her rights,\\nand all her popularity, as well as to all her virtues, would be\\nthe highest possible gratification to me.  you are your mother\\'s self\\nin countenance and disposition; and if i might be allowed to fancy you\\nsuch as she was, in situation and name, and home, presiding and blessing\\nin the same spot, and only superior to her in being more highly valued!\\nmy dearest anne, it would give me more delight than is often felt\\nat my time of life!\"\\n\\nanne was obliged to turn away, to rise, to walk to a distant table,\\nand, leaning there in pretended employment, try to subdue the feelings\\nthis picture excited.  for a few moments her imagination and her heart\\nwere bewitched.  the idea of becoming what her mother had been;\\nof having the precious name of \"lady elliot\" first revived in herself;\\nof being restored to kellynch, calling it her home again,\\nher home for ever, was a charm which she could not immediately resist.\\nlady russell said not another word, willing to leave the matter\\nto its own operation; and believing that, could mr elliot at that moment\\nwith propriety have spoken for himself!--she believed, in short,\\nwhat anne did not believe.  the same image of mr elliot speaking\\nfor himself brought anne to composure again.  the charm of kellynch\\nand of \"lady elliot\" all faded away.  she never could accept him.\\nand it was not only that her feelings were still adverse to any man\\nsave one; her judgement, on a serious consideration of the possibilities\\nof such a case was against mr elliot.\\n\\nthough they had now been acquainted a month, she could not be satisfied\\nthat she really knew his character.  that he was a sensible man,\\nan agreeable man, that he talked well, professed good opinions,\\nseemed to judge properly and as a man of principle, this was all\\nclear enough.  he certainly knew what was right, nor could she fix\\non any one article of moral duty evidently transgressed; but yet she would\\nhave been afraid to answer for his conduct.  she distrusted the past,\\nif not the present.  the names which occasionally dropt\\nof former associates, the allusions to former practices and pursuits,\\nsuggested suspicions not favourable of what he had been.\\nshe saw that there had been bad habits; that sunday travelling\\nhad been a common thing; that there had been a period of his life\\n(and probably not a short one) when he had been, at least,\\ncareless in all serious matters; and, though he might now think\\nvery differently, who could answer for the true sentiments of a clever,\\ncautious man, grown old enough to appreciate a fair character?\\nhow could it ever be ascertained that his mind was truly cleansed?\\n\\nmr elliot was rational, discreet, polished, but he was not open.\\nthere was never any burst of feeling, any warmth of indignation or delight,\\nat the evil or good of others.  this, to anne, was a decided imperfection.\\nher early impressions were incurable.  she prized the frank,\\nthe open-hearted, the eager character beyond all others.\\nwarmth and enthusiasm did captivate her still.  she felt that she could\\nso much more depend upon the sincerity of those who sometimes looked\\nor said a careless or a hasty thing, than of those whose presence of mind\\nnever varied, whose tongue never slipped.\\n\\nmr elliot was too generally agreeable.  various as were the tempers\\nin her father\\'s house, he pleased them all.  he endured too well,\\nstood too well with every body.  he had spoken to her with some\\ndegree of openness of mrs clay; had appeared completely to see\\nwhat mrs clay was about, and to hold her in contempt; and yet\\nmrs clay found him as agreeable as any body.\\n\\nlady russell saw either less or more than her young friend,\\nfor she saw nothing to excite distrust.  she could not imagine\\na man more exactly what he ought to be than mr elliot; nor did she\\never enjoy a sweeter feeling than the hope of seeing him receive\\nthe hand of her beloved anne in kellynch church, in the course of\\nthe following autumn.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 18\\n\\n\\nit was the beginning of february; and anne, having been a month in bath,\\nwas growing very eager for news from uppercross and lyme.\\nshe wanted to hear much more than mary had communicated.\\nit was three weeks since she had heard at all.  she only knew\\nthat henrietta was at home again; and that louisa, though considered to be\\nrecovering fast, was still in lyme; and she was thinking of them all\\nvery intently one evening, when a thicker letter than usual from mary\\nwas delivered to her; and, to quicken the pleasure and surprise,\\nwith admiral and mrs croft\\'s compliments.\\n\\nthe crofts must be in bath!  a circumstance to interest her.\\nthey were people whom her heart turned to very naturally.\\n\\n\"what is this?\" cried sir walter.  \"the crofts have arrived in bath?\\nthe crofts who rent kellynch?  what have they brought you?\"\\n\\n\"a letter from uppercross cottage, sir.\"\\n\\n\"oh! those letters are convenient passports.  they secure an introduction.\\ni should have visited admiral croft, however, at any rate.\\ni know what is due to my tenant.\"\\n\\nanne could listen no longer; she could not even have told how\\nthe poor admiral\\'s complexion escaped; her letter engrossed her.\\nit had been begun several days back.\\n\\n\\n            \"february 1st.\\n\\n\"my dear anne,--i make no apology for my silence, because i know\\nhow little people think of letters in such a place as bath.\\nyou must be a great deal too happy to care for uppercross, which,\\nas you well know, affords little to write about.  we have had\\na very dull christmas; mr and mrs musgrove have not had one dinner party\\nall the holidays.  i do not reckon the hayters as anybody.\\nthe holidays, however, are over at last:  i believe no children ever had\\nsuch long ones.  i am sure i had not.  the house was cleared yesterday,\\nexcept of the little harvilles; but you will be surprised to hear\\nthey have never gone home.  mrs harville must be an odd mother\\nto part with them so long.  i do not understand it.  they are\\nnot at all nice children, in my opinion; but mrs musgrove seems to\\nlike them quite as well, if not better, than her grandchildren.\\nwhat dreadful weather we have had!  it may not be felt in bath,\\nwith your nice pavements; but in the country it is of some consequence.\\ni have not had a creature call on me since the second week in january,\\nexcept charles hayter, who had been calling much oftener than was welcome.\\nbetween ourselves, i think it a great pity henrietta did not remain at lyme\\nas long as louisa; it would have kept her a little out of his way.\\nthe carriage is gone to-day, to bring louisa and the harvilles to-morrow.\\nwe are not asked to dine with them, however, till the day after,\\nmrs musgrove is so afraid of her being fatigued by the journey,\\nwhich is not very likely, considering the care that will be taken of her;\\nand it would be much more convenient to me to dine there to-morrow.\\ni am glad you find mr elliot so agreeable, and wish i could be acquainted\\nwith him too; but i have my usual luck:  i am always out of the way\\nwhen any thing desirable is going on; always the last of my family\\nto be noticed.  what an immense time mrs clay has been staying\\nwith elizabeth!  does she never mean to go away?  but perhaps\\nif she were to leave the room vacant, we might not be invited.\\nlet me know what you think of this.  i do not expect my children\\nto be asked, you know.  i can leave them at the great house very well,\\nfor a month or six weeks.  i have this moment heard that the crofts\\nare going to bath almost immediately; they think the admiral gouty.\\ncharles heard it quite by chance; they have not had the civility\\nto give me any notice, or of offering to take anything.\\ni do not think they improve at all as neighbours.  we see nothing of them,\\nand this is really an instance of gross inattention.  charles joins me\\nin love, and everything proper.  yours affectionately,\\n\\n  \"mary m---.\\n\\n\"i am sorry to say that i am very far from well; and jemima has\\njust told me that the butcher says there is a bad sore-throat\\nvery much about.  i dare say i shall catch it; and my sore-throats,\\nyou know, are always worse than anybody\\'s.\"\\n\\n\\nso ended the first part, which had been afterwards put into an envelope,\\ncontaining nearly as much more.\\n\\n\\n\"i kept my letter open, that i might send you word how louisa\\nbore her journey, and now i am extremely glad i did, having a great deal\\nto add.  in the first place, i had a note from mrs croft yesterday,\\noffering to convey anything to you; a very kind, friendly note indeed,\\naddressed to me, just as it ought; i shall therefore be able to\\nmake my letter as long as i like.  the admiral does not seem very ill,\\nand i sincerely hope bath will do him all the good he wants.\\ni shall be truly glad to have them back again.  our neighbourhood\\ncannot spare such a pleasant family.  but now for louisa.\\ni have something to communicate that will astonish you not a little.\\nshe and the harvilles came on tuesday very safely, and in the evening\\nwe went to ask her how she did, when we were rather surprised\\nnot to find captain benwick of the party, for he had been invited\\nas well as the harvilles; and what do you think was the reason?\\nneither more nor less than his being in love with louisa,\\nand not choosing to venture to uppercross till he had had an answer\\nfrom mr musgrove; for it was all settled between him and her\\nbefore she came away, and he had written to her father by captain harville.\\ntrue, upon my honour!  are not you astonished?  i shall be surprised\\nat least if you ever received a hint of it, for i never did.\\nmrs musgrove protests solemnly that she knew nothing of the matter.\\nwe are all very well pleased, however, for though it is not equal to her\\nmarrying captain wentworth, it is infinitely better than charles hayter;\\nand mr musgrove has written his consent, and captain benwick\\nis expected to-day.  mrs harville says her husband feels a good deal\\non his poor sister\\'s account; but, however, louisa is a great favourite\\nwith both.  indeed, mrs harville and i quite agree that we love her\\nthe better for having nursed her.  charles wonders what captain wentworth\\nwill say; but if you remember, i never thought him attached to louisa;\\ni never could see anything of it.  and this is the end, you see,\\nof captain benwick\\'s being supposed to be an admirer of yours.\\nhow charles could take such a thing into his head was always\\nincomprehensible to me.  i hope he will be more agreeable now.\\ncertainly not a great match for louisa musgrove, but a million times better\\nthan marrying among the hayters.\"\\n\\n\\nmary need not have feared her sister\\'s being in any degree prepared\\nfor the news.  she had never in her life been more astonished.\\ncaptain benwick and louisa musgrove!  it was almost too wonderful\\nfor belief, and it was with the greatest effort that she could remain\\nin the room, preserve an air of calmness, and answer the common questions\\nof the moment.  happily for her, they were not many.  sir walter\\nwanted to know whether the crofts travelled with four horses,\\nand whether they were likely to be situated in such a part of bath\\nas it might suit miss elliot and himself to visit in; but had\\nlittle curiosity beyond.\\n\\n\"how is mary?\" said elizabeth; and without waiting for an answer,\\n\"and pray what brings the crofts to bath?\"\\n\\n\"they come on the admiral\\'s account.  he is thought to be gouty.\"\\n\\n\"gout and decrepitude!\" said sir walter.  \"poor old gentleman.\"\\n\\n\"have they any acquaintance here?\" asked elizabeth.\\n\\n\"i do not know; but i can hardly suppose that, at admiral croft\\'s\\ntime of life, and in his profession, he should not have many acquaintance\\nin such a place as this.\"\\n\\n\"i suspect,\" said sir walter coolly, \"that admiral croft\\nwill be best known in bath as the renter of kellynch hall.\\nelizabeth, may we venture to present him and his wife in laura place?\"\\n\\n\"oh, no! i think not.  situated as we are with lady dalrymple, cousins,\\nwe ought to be very careful not to embarrass her with acquaintance\\nshe might not approve.  if we were not related, it would not signify;\\nbut as cousins, she would feel scrupulous as to any proposal of ours.\\nwe had better leave the crofts to find their own level.\\nthere are several odd-looking men walking about here, who,\\ni am told, are sailors.  the crofts will associate with them.\"\\n\\nthis was sir walter and elizabeth\\'s share of interest in the letter;\\nwhen mrs clay had paid her tribute of more decent attention,\\nin an enquiry after mrs charles musgrove, and her fine little boys,\\nanne was at liberty.\\n\\nin her own room, she tried to comprehend it.  well might charles wonder\\nhow captain wentworth would feel!  perhaps he had quitted the field,\\nhad given louisa up, had ceased to love, had found he did not love her.\\nshe could not endure the idea of treachery or levity, or anything\\nakin to ill usage between him and his friend.  she could not endure\\nthat such a friendship as theirs should be severed unfairly.\\n\\ncaptain benwick and louisa musgrove!  the high-spirited,\\njoyous-talking louisa musgrove, and the dejected, thinking,\\nfeeling, reading, captain benwick, seemed each of them everything\\nthat would not suit the other.  their minds most dissimilar!\\nwhere could have been the attraction?  the answer soon presented itself.\\nit had been in situation.  they had been thrown together several weeks;\\nthey had been living in the same small family party:  since henrietta\\'s\\ncoming away, they must have been depending almost entirely on each other,\\nand louisa, just recovering from illness, had been in an interesting state,\\nand captain benwick was not inconsolable.  that was a point which anne\\nhad not been able to avoid suspecting before; and instead of drawing\\nthe same conclusion as mary, from the present course of events,\\nthey served only to confirm the idea of his having felt some\\ndawning of tenderness toward herself.  she did not mean, however,\\nto derive much more from it to gratify her vanity, than mary\\nmight have allowed.  she was persuaded that any tolerably pleasing\\nyoung woman who had listened and seemed to feel for him would have\\nreceived the same compliment.  he had an affectionate heart.\\nhe must love somebody.\\n\\nshe saw no reason against their being happy.  louisa had fine\\nnaval fervour to begin with, and they would soon grow more alike.\\nhe would gain cheerfulness, and she would learn to be an enthusiast\\nfor scott and lord byron; nay, that was probably learnt already;\\nof course they had fallen in love over poetry.  the idea of\\nlouisa musgrove turned into a person of literary taste,\\nand sentimental reflection was amusing, but she had no doubt\\nof its being so.  the day at lyme, the fall from the cobb,\\nmight influence her health, her nerves, her courage, her character to\\nthe end of her life, as thoroughly as it appeared to have\\ninfluenced her fate.\\n\\nthe conclusion of the whole was, that if the woman who had been sensible\\nof captain wentworth\\'s merits could be allowed to prefer another man,\\nthere was nothing in the engagement to excite lasting wonder;\\nand if captain wentworth lost no friend by it, certainly nothing\\nto be regretted.  no, it was not regret which made anne\\'s heart\\nbeat in spite of herself, and brought the colour into her cheeks\\nwhen she thought of captain wentworth unshackled and free.\\nshe had some feelings which she was ashamed to investigate.\\nthey were too much like joy, senseless joy!\\n\\nshe longed to see the crofts; but when the meeting took place,\\nit was evident that no rumour of the news had yet reached them.\\nthe visit of ceremony was paid and returned; and louisa musgrove\\nwas mentioned, and captain benwick, too, without even half a smile.\\n\\nthe crofts had placed themselves in lodgings in gay street,\\nperfectly to sir walter\\'s satisfaction.  he was not at all ashamed\\nof the acquaintance, and did, in fact, think and talk a great deal more\\nabout the admiral, than the admiral ever thought or talked about him.\\n\\nthe crofts knew quite as many people in bath as they wished for,\\nand considered their intercourse with the elliots as a mere matter of form,\\nand not in the least likely to afford them any pleasure.\\nthey brought with them their country habit of being almost always together.\\nhe was ordered to walk to keep off the gout, and mrs croft\\nseemed to go shares with him in everything, and to walk\\nfor her life to do him good.  anne saw them wherever she went.\\nlady russell took her out in her carriage almost every morning,\\nand she never failed to think of them, and never failed to see them.\\nknowing their feelings as she did, it was a most attractive picture\\nof happiness to her.  she always watched them as long as she could,\\ndelighted to fancy she understood what they might be talking of,\\nas they walked along in happy independence, or equally delighted\\nto see the admiral\\'s hearty shake of the hand when he encountered\\nan old friend, and observe their eagerness of conversation\\nwhen occasionally forming into a little knot of the navy, mrs croft\\nlooking as intelligent and keen as any of the officers around her.\\n\\nanne was too much engaged with lady russell to be often walking herself;\\nbut it so happened that one morning, about a week or ten days\\nafter the croft\\'s arrival, it suited her best to leave her friend,\\nor her friend\\'s carriage, in the lower part of the town,\\nand return alone to camden place, and in walking up milsom street\\nshe had the good fortune to meet with the admiral.  he was standing\\nby himself at a printshop window, with his hands behind him,\\nin earnest contemplation of some print, and she not only might have\\npassed him unseen, but was obliged to touch as well as address him\\nbefore she could catch his notice.  when he did perceive and\\nacknowledge her, however, it was done with all his usual frankness\\nand good humour.  \"ha! is it you?  thank you, thank you.\\nthis is treating me like a friend.  here i am, you see,\\nstaring at a picture.  i can never get by this shop without stopping.\\nbut what a thing here is, by way of a boat!  do look at it.\\ndid you ever see the like?  what queer fellows your fine painters must be,\\nto think that anybody would venture their lives in such a shapeless\\nold cockleshell as that?  and yet here are two gentlemen\\nstuck up in it mightily at their ease, and looking about them at the rocks\\nand mountains, as if they were not to be upset the next moment,\\nwhich they certainly must be.  i wonder where that boat was built!\"\\n(laughing heartily); \"i would not venture over a horsepond in it.\\nwell,\" (turning away), \"now, where are you bound?  can i go anywhere\\nfor you, or with you?  can i be of any use?\"\\n\\n\"none, i thank you, unless you will give me the pleasure of your company\\nthe little way our road lies together.  i am going home.\"\\n\\n\\n\"that i will, with all my heart, and farther, too.  yes, yes\\nwe will have a snug walk together, and i have something to tell you\\nas we go along.  there, take my arm; that\\'s right; i do not\\nfeel comfortable if i have not a woman there.  lord! what a boat it is!\"\\ntaking a last look at the picture, as they began to be in motion.\\n\\n\"did you say that you had something to tell me, sir?\"\\n\\n\"yes, i have, presently.  but here comes a friend, captain brigden;\\ni shall only say, `how d\\'ye do?\\' as we pass, however.  i shall not stop.\\n`how d\\'ye do?\\'  brigden stares to see anybody with me but my wife.\\nshe, poor soul, is tied by the leg.  she has a blister on one of her heels,\\nas large as a three-shilling piece.  if you look across the street,\\nyou will see admiral brand coming down and his brother.  shabby fellows,\\nboth of them!  i am glad they are not on this side of the way.\\nsophy cannot bear them.  they played me a pitiful trick once:\\ngot away with some of my best men.  i will tell you the whole story\\nanother time.  there comes old sir archibald drew and his grandson.\\nlook, he sees us; he kisses his hand to you; he takes you for my wife.\\nah! the peace has come too soon for that younker.  poor old sir archibald!\\nhow do you like bath, miss elliot?  it suits us very well.\\nwe are always meeting with some old friend or other; the streets\\nfull of them every morning; sure to have plenty of chat;\\nand then we get away from them all, and shut ourselves in our lodgings,\\nand draw in our chairs, and are snug as if we were at kellynch,\\nay, or as we used to be even at north yarmouth and deal.\\nwe do not like our lodgings here the worse, i can tell you,\\nfor putting us in mind of those we first had at north yarmouth.\\nthe wind blows through one of the cupboards just in the same way.\"\\n\\nwhen they were got a little farther, anne ventured to press again\\nfor what he had to communicate.  she hoped when clear of milsom street\\nto have her curiosity gratified; but she was still obliged to wait,\\nfor the admiral had made up his mind not to begin till they had\\ngained the greater space and quiet of belmont; and as she was\\nnot really mrs croft, she must let him have his own way.\\nas soon as they were fairly ascending belmont, he began--\\n\\n\"well, now you shall hear something that will surprise you.\\nbut first of all, you must tell me the name of the young lady\\ni am going to talk about.  that young lady, you know, that we have\\nall been so concerned for.  the miss musgrove, that all this has been\\nhappening to.  her christian name:  i always forget her christian name.\"\\n\\nanne had been ashamed to appear to comprehend so soon as she really\\ndid; but now she could safely suggest the name of \"louisa.\"\\n\\n\"ay, ay, miss louisa musgrove, that is the name.  i wish young ladies\\nhad not such a number of fine christian names.  i should never be out\\nif they were all sophys, or something of that sort.  well,\\nthis miss louisa, we all thought, you know, was to marry frederick.\\nhe was courting her week after week.  the only wonder was,\\nwhat they could be waiting for, till the business at lyme came;\\nthen, indeed, it was clear enough that they must wait till her brain\\nwas set to right.  but even then there was something odd in their\\nway of going on.  instead of staying at lyme, he went off to plymouth,\\nand then he went off to see edward.  when we came back from minehead\\nhe was gone down to edward\\'s, and there he has been ever since.\\nwe have seen nothing of him since november.  even sophy could\\nnot understand it.  but now, the matter has take the strangest turn of all;\\nfor this young lady, the same miss musgrove, instead of being\\nto marry frederick, is to marry james benwick.  you know james benwick.\"\\n\\n\"a little.  i am a little acquainted with captain benwick.\"\\n\\n\"well, she is to marry him.  nay, most likely they are married already,\\nfor i do not know what they should wait for.\"\\n\\n\"i thought captain benwick a very pleasing young man,\" said anne,\\n\"and i understand that he bears an excellent character.\"\\n\\n\"oh! yes, yes, there is not a word to be said against james benwick.\\nhe is only a commander, it is true, made last summer, and these are\\nbad times for getting on, but he has not another fault that i know of.\\nan excellent, good-hearted fellow, i assure you; a very active,\\nzealous officer too, which is more than you would think for, perhaps,\\nfor that soft sort of manner does not do him justice.\"\\n\\n\"indeed you are mistaken there, sir; i should never augur want of spirit\\nfrom captain benwick\\'s manners.  i thought them particularly pleasing,\\nand i will answer for it, they would generally please.\"\\n\\n\"well, well, ladies are the best judges; but james benwick is rather too\\npiano for me; and though very likely it is all our partiality,\\nsophy and i cannot help thinking frederick\\'s manners better than his.\\nthere is something about frederick more to our taste.\"\\n\\nanne was caught.  she had only meant to oppose the too common idea\\nof spirit and gentleness being incompatible with each other,\\nnot at all to represent captain benwick\\'s manners as the very best\\nthat could possibly be; and, after a little hesitation,\\nshe was beginning to say, \"i was not entering into any comparison\\nof the two friends,\" but the admiral interrupted her with--\\n\\n\"and the thing is certainly true.  it is not a mere bit of gossip.\\nwe have it from frederick himself.  his sister had a letter\\nfrom him yesterday, in which he tells us of it, and he had just had it\\nin a letter from harville, written upon the spot, from uppercross.\\ni fancy they are all at uppercross.\"\\n\\nthis was an opportunity which anne could not resist; she said, therefore,\\n\"i hope, admiral, i hope there is nothing in the style of captain\\nwentworth\\'s letter to make you and mrs croft particularly uneasy.\\nit did seem, last autumn, as if there were an attachment between him\\nand louisa musgrove; but i hope it may be understood to have worn out\\non each side equally, and without violence.  i hope his letter\\ndoes not breathe the spirit of an ill-used man.\"\\n\\n\"not at all, not at all; there is not an oath or a murmur\\nfrom beginning to end.\"\\n\\nanne looked down to hide her smile.\\n\\n\"no, no; frederick is not a man to whine and complain; he has\\ntoo much spirit for that.  if the girl likes another man better,\\nit is very fit she should have him.\"\\n\\n\"certainly.  but what i mean is, that i hope there is nothing\\nin captain wentworth\\'s manner of writing to make you suppose\\nhe thinks himself ill-used by his friend, which might appear,\\nyou know, without its being absolutely said.  i should be very sorry\\nthat such a friendship as has subsisted between him and captain benwick\\nshould be destroyed, or even wounded, by a circumstance of this sort.\"\\n\\n\"yes, yes, i understand you.  but there is nothing at all of that nature\\nin the letter.  he does not give the least fling at benwick;\\ndoes not so much as say, `i wonder at it, i have a reason of my own\\nfor wondering at it.\\'  no, you would not guess, from his way of writing,\\nthat he had ever thought of this miss (what\\'s her name?) for himself.\\nhe very handsomely hopes they will be happy together; and there is\\nnothing very unforgiving in that, i think.\"\\n\\nanne did not receive the perfect conviction which the admiral meant\\nto convey, but it would have been useless to press the enquiry farther.\\nshe therefore satisfied herself with common-place remarks or quiet\\nattention, and the admiral had it all his own way.\\n\\n\"poor frederick!\" said he at last.  \"now he must begin all over again\\nwith somebody else.  i think we must get him to bath.  sophy must write,\\nand beg him to come to bath.  here are pretty girls enough, i am sure.\\nit would be of no use to go to uppercross again, for that other\\nmiss musgrove, i find, is bespoke by her cousin, the young parson.\\ndo not you think, miss elliot, we had better try to get him to bath?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 19\\n\\n\\nwhile admiral croft was taking this walk with anne, and expressing\\nhis wish of getting captain wentworth to bath, captain wentworth\\nwas already on his way thither.  before mrs croft had written,\\nhe was arrived, and the very next time anne walked out, she saw him.\\n\\nmr elliot was attending his two cousins and mrs clay.  they were\\nin milsom street.  it began to rain, not much, but enough to\\nmake shelter desirable for women, and quite enough to make it\\nvery desirable for miss elliot to have the advantage of being\\nconveyed home in lady dalrymple\\'s carriage, which was seen waiting\\nat a little distance; she, anne, and mrs clay, therefore,\\nturned into molland\\'s, while mr elliot stepped to lady dalrymple,\\nto request her assistance.  he soon joined them again, successful,\\nof course; lady dalrymple would be most happy to take them home,\\nand would call for them in a few minutes.\\n\\nher ladyship\\'s carriage was a barouche, and did not hold\\nmore than four with any comfort.  miss carteret was with her mother;\\nconsequently it was not reasonable to expect accommodation\\nfor all the three camden place ladies.  there could be no doubt\\nas to miss elliot.  whoever suffered inconvenience, she must suffer none,\\nbut it occupied a little time to settle the point of civility\\nbetween the other two.  the rain was a mere trifle, and anne was\\nmost sincere in preferring a walk with mr elliot.  but the rain was also\\na mere trifle to mrs clay; she would hardly allow it even to drop at all,\\nand her boots were so thick! much thicker than miss anne\\'s;\\nand, in short, her civility rendered her quite as anxious to be left\\nto walk with mr elliot as anne could be, and it was discussed between them\\nwith a generosity so polite and so determined, that the others were\\nobliged to settle it for them; miss elliot maintaining that mrs clay\\nhad a little cold already, and mr elliot deciding on appeal,\\nthat his cousin anne\\'s boots were rather the thickest.\\n\\nit was fixed accordingly, that mrs clay should be of the party\\nin the carriage; and they had just reached this point, when anne,\\nas she sat near the window, descried, most decidedly and distinctly,\\ncaptain wentworth walking down the street.\\n\\nher start was perceptible only to herself; but she instantly felt that\\nshe was the greatest simpleton in the world, the most unaccountable\\nand absurd!  for a few minutes she saw nothing before her;\\nit was all confusion.  she was lost, and when she had scolded\\nback her senses, she found the others still waiting for the carriage,\\nand mr elliot (always obliging) just setting off for union street\\non a commission of mrs clay\\'s.\\n\\nshe now felt a great inclination to go to the outer door;\\nshe wanted to see if it rained.  why was she to suspect herself\\nof another motive?  captain wentworth must be out of sight.\\nshe left her seat, she would go; one half of her should not be always\\nso much wiser than the other half, or always suspecting the other\\nof being worse than it was.  she would see if it rained.\\nshe was sent back, however, in a moment by the entrance of\\ncaptain wentworth himself, among a party of gentlemen and ladies,\\nevidently his acquaintance, and whom he must have joined\\na little below milsom street.  he was more obviously struck\\nand confused by the sight of her than she had ever observed before;\\nhe looked quite red.  for the first time, since their renewed acquaintance,\\nshe felt that she was betraying the least sensibility of the two.\\nshe had the advantage of him in the preparation of the last few moments.\\nall the overpowering, blinding, bewildering, first effects\\nof strong surprise were over with her.  still, however,\\nshe had enough to feel!  it was agitation, pain, pleasure,\\na something between delight and misery.\\n\\nhe spoke to her, and then turned away.  the character of his manner\\nwas embarrassment.  she could not have called it either cold or friendly,\\nor anything so certainly as embarrassed.\\n\\nafter a short interval, however, he came towards her, and spoke again.\\nmutual enquiries on common subjects passed:  neither of them, probably,\\nmuch the wiser for what they heard, and anne continuing fully sensible\\nof his being less at ease than formerly.  they had by dint of being\\nso very much together, got to speak to each other with a considerable\\nportion of apparent indifference and calmness; but he could not do it now.\\ntime had changed him, or louisa had changed him.  there was consciousness\\nof some sort or other.  he looked very well, not as if he had been\\nsuffering in health or spirits, and he talked of uppercross,\\nof the musgroves, nay, even of louisa, and had even a momentary look\\nof his own arch significance as he named her; but yet it was\\ncaptain wentworth not comfortable, not easy, not able to feign that he was.\\n\\nit did not surprise, but it grieved anne to observe that elizabeth\\nwould not know him.  she saw that he saw elizabeth, that elizabeth saw him,\\nthat there was complete internal recognition on each side;\\nshe was convinced that he was ready to be acknowledged as an acquaintance,\\nexpecting it, and she had the pain of seeing her sister turn away\\nwith unalterable coldness.\\n\\nlady dalrymple\\'s carriage, for which miss elliot was growing\\nvery impatient, now drew up; the servant came in to announce it.\\nit was beginning to rain again, and altogether there was a delay,\\nand a bustle, and a talking, which must make all the little crowd\\nin the shop understand that lady dalrymple was calling to convey\\nmiss elliot.  at last miss elliot and her friend, unattended but\\nby the servant, (for there was no cousin returned), were walking off;\\nand captain wentworth, watching them, turned again to anne,\\nand by manner, rather than words, was offering his services to her.\\n\\n\"i am much obliged to you,\" was her answer, \"but i am not going with them.\\nthe carriage would not accommodate so many.  i walk:  i prefer walking.\"\\n\\n\"but it rains.\"\\n\\n\"oh! very little,  nothing that i regard.\"\\n\\nafter a moment\\'s pause he said:  \"though i came only yesterday,\\ni have equipped myself properly for bath already, you see,\"\\n(pointing to a new umbrella); \"i wish you would make use of it,\\nif you are determined to walk; though i think it would be more prudent\\nto let me get you a chair.\"\\n\\nshe was very much obliged to him, but declined it all, repeating\\nher conviction, that the rain would come to nothing at present,\\nand adding, \"i am only waiting for mr elliot.  he will be here in a moment,\\ni am sure.\"\\n\\nshe had hardly spoken the words when mr elliot walked in.\\ncaptain wentworth recollected him perfectly.  there was no difference\\nbetween him and the man who had stood on the steps at lyme,\\nadmiring anne as she passed, except in the air and look and manner\\nof the privileged relation and friend.  he came in with eagerness,\\nappeared to see and think only of her, apologised for his stay,\\nwas grieved to have kept her waiting, and anxious to get her away\\nwithout further loss of time and before the rain increased;\\nand in another moment they walked off together, her arm under his,\\na gentle and embarrassed glance, and a \"good morning to you!\"\\nbeing all that she had time for, as she passed away.\\n\\nas soon as they were out of sight, the ladies of captain wentworth\\'s party\\nbegan talking of them.\\n\\n\"mr elliot does not dislike his cousin, i fancy?\"\\n\\n\"oh! no, that is clear enough.  one can guess what will happen there.\\nhe is always with them; half lives in the family, i believe.\\nwhat a very good-looking man!\"\\n\\n\"yes, and miss atkinson, who dined with him once at the wallises,\\nsays he is the most agreeable man she ever was in company with.\"\\n\\n\"she is pretty, i think; anne elliot; very pretty, when one comes\\nto look at her.  it is not the fashion to say so, but i confess\\ni admire her more than her sister.\"\\n\\n\"oh! so do i.\"\\n\\n\"and so do i.  no comparison.  but the men are all wild after miss elliot.\\nanne is too delicate for them.\"\\n\\nanne would have been particularly obliged to her cousin, if he would have\\nwalked by her side all the way to camden place, without saying a word.\\nshe had never found it so difficult to listen to him, though nothing\\ncould exceed his solicitude and care, and though his subjects\\nwere principally such as were wont to be always interesting:\\npraise, warm, just, and discriminating, of lady russell,\\nand insinuations highly rational against mrs clay.  but just now\\nshe could think only of captain wentworth.  she could not understand\\nhis present feelings, whether he were really suffering much\\nfrom disappointment or not; and till that point were settled,\\nshe could not be quite herself.\\n\\nshe hoped to be wise and reasonable in time; but alas! alas!\\nshe must confess to herself that she was not wise yet.\\n\\nanother circumstance very essential for her to know, was how long\\nhe meant to be in bath; he had not mentioned it, or she could not\\nrecollect it.  he might be only passing through.  but it was more probable\\nthat he should be come to stay.  in that case, so liable as every body was\\nto meet every body in bath, lady russell would in all likelihood\\nsee him somewhere.  would she recollect him?  how would it all be?\\n\\nshe had already been obliged to tell lady russell that louisa musgrove\\nwas to marry captain benwick.  it had cost her something to encounter\\nlady russell\\'s surprise; and now, if she were by any chance\\nto be thrown into company with captain wentworth, her imperfect knowledge\\nof the matter might add another shade of prejudice against him.\\n\\nthe following morning anne was out with her friend, and for the first hour,\\nin an incessant and fearful sort of watch for him in vain; but at last,\\nin returning down pulteney street, she distinguished him\\non the right hand pavement at such a distance as to have him in view\\nthe greater part of the street.  there were many other men about him,\\nmany groups walking the same way, but there was no mistaking him.\\nshe looked instinctively at lady russell; but not from any mad idea\\nof her recognising him so soon as she did herself.  no, it was\\nnot to be supposed that lady russell would perceive him till they\\nwere nearly opposite.  she looked at her however, from time to time,\\nanxiously; and when the moment approached which must point him out,\\nthough not daring to look again (for her own countenance she knew\\nwas unfit to be seen), she was yet perfectly conscious of\\nlady russell\\'s eyes being turned exactly in the direction for him--\\nof her being, in short, intently observing him.  she could thoroughly\\ncomprehend the sort of fascination he must possess over lady russell\\'s mind,\\nthe difficulty it must be for her to withdraw her eyes, the astonishment\\nshe must be feeling that eight or nine years should have passed over him,\\nand in foreign climes and in active service too, without robbing him\\nof one personal grace!\\n\\nat last, lady russell drew back her head.  \"now, how would she\\nspeak of him?\"\\n\\n\"you will wonder,\" said she, \"what has been fixing my eye so long;\\nbut i was looking after some window-curtains, which lady alicia and\\nmrs frankland were telling me of last night.  they described\\nthe drawing-room window-curtains of one of the houses on this\\nside of the way, and this part of the street, as being the handsomest\\nand best hung of any in bath, but could not recollect the exact number,\\nand i have been trying to find out which it could be; but i confess\\ni can see no curtains hereabouts that answer their description.\"\\n\\nanne sighed and blushed and smiled, in pity and disdain,\\neither at her friend or herself.  the part which provoked her most,\\nwas that in all this waste of foresight and caution, she should have\\nlost the right moment for seeing whether he saw them.\\n\\na day or two passed without producing anything.  the theatre or the rooms,\\nwhere he was most likely to be, were not fashionable enough\\nfor the elliots, whose evening amusements were solely in the\\nelegant stupidity of private parties, in which they were getting\\nmore and more engaged; and anne, wearied of such a state of stagnation,\\nsick of knowing nothing, and fancying herself stronger because\\nher strength was not tried, was quite impatient for the concert evening.\\nit was a concert for the benefit of a person patronised by lady dalrymple.\\nof course they must attend.  it was really expected to be a good one,\\nand captain wentworth was very fond of music.  if she could only have\\na few minutes conversation with him again, she fancied she should\\nbe satisfied; and as to the power of addressing him, she felt all over\\ncourage if the opportunity occurred.  elizabeth had turned from him,\\nlady russell overlooked him; her nerves were strengthened\\nby these circumstances; she felt that she owed him attention.\\n\\nshe had once partly promised mrs smith to spend the evening with her;\\nbut in a short hurried call she excused herself and put it off,\\nwith the more decided promise of a longer visit on the morrow.\\nmrs smith gave a most good-humoured acquiescence.\\n\\n\"by all means,\" said she; \"only tell me all about it, when you do come.\\nwho is your party?\"\\n\\nanne named them all.  mrs smith made no reply; but when she was\\nleaving her said, and with an expression half serious, half arch,\\n\"well, i heartily wish your concert may answer; and do not fail me\\nto-morrow if you can come; for i begin to have a foreboding\\nthat i may not have many more visits from you.\"\\n\\nanne was startled and confused; but after standing in a moment\\'s suspense,\\nwas obliged, and not sorry to be obliged, to hurry away.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 20\\n\\n\\nsir walter, his two daughters, and mrs clay, were the earliest\\nof all their party at the rooms in the evening; and as lady dalrymple\\nmust be waited for, they took their station by one of the fires\\nin the octagon room.  but hardly were they so settled, when the door\\nopened again, and captain wentworth walked in alone.  anne was\\nthe nearest to him, and making yet a little advance, she instantly spoke.\\nhe was preparing only to bow and pass on, but her gentle \"how do you do?\"\\nbrought him out of the straight line to stand near her, and make enquiries\\nin return, in spite of the formidable father and sister in the back ground.\\ntheir being in the back ground was a support to anne; she knew nothing\\nof their looks, and felt equal to everything which she believed\\nright to be done.\\n\\nwhile they were speaking, a whispering between her father and elizabeth\\ncaught her ear.  she could not distinguish, but she must guess the subject;\\nand on captain wentworth\\'s making a distant bow, she comprehended\\nthat her father had judged so well as to give him that\\nsimple acknowledgement of acquaintance, and she was just in time\\nby a side glance to see a slight curtsey from elizabeth herself.\\nthis, though late, and reluctant, and ungracious, was yet\\nbetter than nothing, and her spirits improved.\\n\\nafter talking, however, of the weather, and bath, and the concert,\\ntheir conversation began to flag, and so little was said at last,\\nthat she was expecting him to go every moment, but he did not;\\nhe seemed in no hurry to leave her; and presently with renewed spirit,\\nwith a little smile, a little glow, he said--\\n\\n\"i have hardly seen you since our day at lyme.  i am afraid you must have\\nsuffered from the shock, and the more from its not overpowering you\\nat the time.\"\\n\\nshe assured him that she had not.\\n\\n\"it was a frightful hour,\" said he, \"a frightful day!\" and he\\npassed his hand across his eyes, as if the remembrance were still\\ntoo painful, but in a moment, half smiling again, added,\\n\"the day has produced some effects however; has had some consequences\\nwhich must be considered as the very reverse of frightful.\\nwhen you had the presence of mind to suggest that benwick would be\\nthe properest person to fetch a surgeon, you could have little idea\\nof his being eventually one of those most concerned in her recovery.\"\\n\\n\"certainly i could have none.  but it appears--i should hope it would be\\na very happy match.  there are on both sides good principles\\nand good temper.\"\\n\\n\"yes,\" said he, looking not exactly forward; \"but there, i think,\\nends the resemblance.  with all my soul i wish them happy, and rejoice\\nover every circumstance in favour of it.  they have no difficulties\\nto contend with at home, no opposition, no caprice, no delays.\\nthe musgroves are behaving like themselves, most honourably and kindly,\\nonly anxious with true parental hearts to promote their daughter\\'s comfort.\\nall this is much, very much in favour of their happiness;\\nmore than perhaps--\"\\n\\nhe stopped.  a sudden recollection seemed to occur, and to give him\\nsome taste of that emotion which was reddening anne\\'s cheeks\\nand fixing her eyes on the ground.  after clearing his throat, however,\\nhe proceeded thus--\\n\\n\"i confess that i do think there is a disparity, too great a disparity,\\nand in a point no less essential than mind.  i regard louisa musgrove\\nas a very amiable, sweet-tempered girl, and not deficient in understanding,\\nbut benwick is something more.  he is a clever man, a reading man;\\nand i confess, that i do consider his attaching himself to her\\nwith some surprise.  had it been the effect of gratitude,\\nhad he learnt to love her, because he believed her to be preferring him,\\nit would have been another thing.  but i have no reason to suppose it so.\\nit seems, on the contrary, to have been a perfectly spontaneous,\\nuntaught feeling on his side, and this surprises me.  a man like him,\\nin his situation! with a heart pierced, wounded, almost broken!\\nfanny harville was a very superior creature, and his attachment to her\\nwas indeed attachment.  a man does not recover from such\\na devotion of the heart to such a woman.  he ought not; he does not.\"\\n\\neither from the consciousness, however, that his friend had recovered,\\nor from other consciousness, he went no farther; and anne who,\\nin spite of the agitated voice in which the latter part had been uttered,\\nand in spite of all the various noises of the room, the almost ceaseless\\nslam of the door, and ceaseless buzz of persons walking through,\\nhad distinguished every word, was struck, gratified, confused,\\nand beginning to breathe very quick, and feel an hundred things\\nin a moment.  it was impossible for her to enter on such a subject;\\nand yet, after a pause, feeling the necessity of speaking,\\nand having not the smallest wish for a total change, she only deviated\\nso far as to say--\\n\\n\"you were a good while at lyme, i think?\"\\n\\n\"about a fortnight.  i could not leave it till louisa\\'s doing well\\nwas quite ascertained.  i had been too deeply concerned in the mischief\\nto be soon at peace.  it had been my doing, solely mine.\\nshe would not have been obstinate if i had not been weak.\\nthe country round lyme is very fine.  i walked and rode a great deal;\\nand the more i saw, the more i found to admire.\"\\n\\n\"i should very much like to see lyme again,\" said anne.\\n\\n\"indeed!  i should not have supposed that you could have found\\nanything in lyme to inspire such a feeling.  the horror and distress\\nyou were involved in, the stretch of mind, the wear of spirits!\\ni should have thought your last impressions of lyme must have been\\nstrong disgust.\"\\n\\n\"the last hours were certainly very painful,\" replied anne;\\n\"but when pain is over, the remembrance of it often becomes a pleasure.\\none does not love a place the less for having suffered in it,\\nunless it has been all suffering, nothing but suffering, which was\\nby no means the case at lyme.  we were only in anxiety and distress\\nduring the last two hours, and previously there had been a great deal\\nof enjoyment.  so much novelty and beauty! i have travelled so little,\\nthat every fresh place would be interesting to me; but there is real beauty\\nat lyme; and in short\" (with a faint blush at some recollections),\\n\"altogether my impressions of the place are very agreeable.\"\\n\\nas she ceased, the entrance door opened again, and the very party appeared\\nfor whom they were waiting.  \"lady dalrymple, lady dalrymple,\"\\nwas the rejoicing sound; and with all the eagerness compatible\\nwith anxious elegance, sir walter and his two ladies stepped forward\\nto meet her.  lady dalrymple and miss carteret, escorted by mr elliot\\nand colonel wallis, who had happened to arrive nearly at the same instant,\\nadvanced into the room.  the others joined them, and it was\\na group in which anne found herself also necessarily included.\\nshe was divided from captain wentworth.  their interesting,\\nalmost too interesting conversation must be broken up for a time,\\nbut slight was the penance compared with the happiness which brought it on!\\nshe had learnt, in the last ten minutes, more of his feelings\\ntowards louisa, more of all his feelings than she dared to think of;\\nand she gave herself up to the demands of the party, to the needful\\ncivilities of the moment, with exquisite, though agitated sensations.\\nshe was in good humour with all.  she had received ideas which\\ndisposed her to be courteous and kind to all, and to pity every one,\\nas being less happy than herself.\\n\\nthe delightful emotions were a little subdued, when on stepping back\\nfrom the group, to be joined again by captain wentworth, she saw\\nthat he was gone.  she was just in time to see him turn into\\nthe concert room.  he was gone; he had disappeared, she felt\\na moment\\'s regret.  but \"they should meet again.  he would look for her,\\nhe would find her out before the evening were over, and at present,\\nperhaps, it was as well to be asunder.  she was in need of\\na little interval for recollection.\"\\n\\nupon lady russell\\'s appearance soon afterwards, the whole party\\nwas collected, and all that remained was to marshal themselves,\\nand proceed into the concert room; and be of all the consequence\\nin their power, draw as many eyes, excite as many whispers,\\nand disturb as many people as they could.\\n\\nvery, very happy were both elizabeth and anne elliot as they walked in.\\nelizabeth arm in arm with miss carteret, and looking on the broad back\\nof the dowager viscountess dalrymple before her, had nothing to wish for\\nwhich did not seem within her reach; and anne--but it would be\\nan insult to the nature of anne\\'s felicity, to draw any comparison\\nbetween it and her sister\\'s; the origin of one all selfish vanity,\\nof the other all generous attachment.\\n\\nanne saw nothing, thought nothing of the brilliancy of the room.\\nher happiness was from within.  her eyes were bright and her cheeks glowed;\\nbut she knew nothing about it.  she was thinking only of\\nthe last half hour, and as they passed to their seats, her mind took\\na hasty range over it.  his choice of subjects, his expressions,\\nand still more his manner and look, had been such as she could see\\nin only one light.  his opinion of louisa musgrove\\'s inferiority,\\nan opinion which he had seemed solicitous to give, his wonder\\nat captain benwick, his feelings as to a first, strong attachment;\\nsentences begun which he could not finish, his half averted eyes\\nand more than half expressive glance, all, all declared that he had\\na heart returning to her at least; that anger, resentment, avoidance,\\nwere no more; and that they were succeeded, not merely by friendship\\nand regard, but by the tenderness of the past.  yes, some share of\\nthe tenderness of the past.  she could not contemplate the change\\nas implying less.  he must love her.\\n\\nthese were thoughts, with their attendant visions, which occupied\\nand flurried her too much to leave her any power of observation;\\nand she passed along the room without having a glimpse of him,\\nwithout even trying to discern him.  when their places were determined on,\\nand they were all properly arranged, she looked round to see\\nif he should happen to be in the same part of the room, but he was not;\\nher eye could not reach him; and the concert being just opening,\\nshe must consent for a time to be happy in a humbler way.\\n\\nthe party was divided and disposed of on two contiguous benches:\\nanne was among those on the foremost, and mr elliot had manoeuvred so well,\\nwith the assistance of his friend colonel wallis, as to have a seat by her.\\nmiss elliot, surrounded by her cousins, and the principal object\\nof colonel wallis\\'s gallantry, was quite contented.\\n\\nanne\\'s mind was in a most favourable state for the entertainment\\nof the evening; it was just occupation enough:  she had feelings for\\nthe tender, spirits for the gay, attention for the scientific,\\nand patience for the wearisome; and had never liked a concert better,\\nat least during the first act.  towards the close of it,\\nin the interval succeeding an italian song, she explained\\nthe words of the song to mr elliot.  they had a concert bill between them.\\n\\n\"this,\" said she, \"is nearly the sense, or rather the meaning of the words,\\nfor certainly the sense of an italian love-song must not be talked of,\\nbut it is as nearly the meaning as i can give; for i do not pretend\\nto understand the language.  i am a very poor italian scholar.\"\\n\\n\"yes, yes, i see you are.  i see you know nothing of the matter.\\nyou have only knowledge enough of the language to translate at sight\\nthese inverted, transposed, curtailed italian lines, into clear,\\ncomprehensible, elegant english.  you need not say anything more\\nof your ignorance.  here is complete proof.\"\\n\\n\"i will not oppose such kind politeness; but i should be sorry to be\\nexamined by a real proficient.\"\\n\\n\"i have not had the pleasure of visiting in camden place so long,\"\\nreplied he, \"without knowing something of miss anne elliot;\\nand i do regard her as one who is too modest for the world in general\\nto be aware of half her accomplishments, and too highly accomplished\\nfor modesty to be natural in any other woman.\"\\n\\n\"for shame! for shame! this is too much flattery.  i forget what we are\\nto have next,\" turning to the bill.\\n\\n\"perhaps,\" said mr elliot, speaking low, \"i have had a longer acquaintance\\nwith your character than you are aware of.\"\\n\\n\"indeed!  how so?  you can have been acquainted with it only since\\ni came to bath, excepting as you might hear me previously spoken of\\nin my own family.\"\\n\\n\"i knew you by report long before you came to bath.  i had heard you\\ndescribed by those who knew you intimately.  i have been acquainted\\nwith you by character many years.  your person, your disposition,\\naccomplishments, manner; they were all present to me.\"\\n\\nmr elliot was not disappointed in the interest he hoped to raise.\\nno one can withstand the charm of such a mystery.  to have been\\ndescribed long ago to a recent acquaintance, by nameless people,\\nis irresistible; and anne was all curiosity.  she wondered,\\nand questioned him eagerly; but in vain.  he delighted in being asked,\\nbut he would not tell.\\n\\n\"no, no, some time or other, perhaps, but not now.  he would mention\\nno names now; but such, he could assure her, had been the fact.\\nhe had many years ago received such a description of miss anne elliot\\nas had inspired him with the highest idea of her merit, and excited\\nthe warmest curiosity to know her.\"\\n\\nanne could think of no one so likely to have spoken with\\npartiality of her many years ago as the mr wentworth of monkford,\\ncaptain wentworth\\'s brother.  he might have been in mr elliot\\'s company,\\nbut she had not courage to ask the question.\\n\\n\"the name of anne elliot,\" said he, \"has long had an interesting sound to me.\\nvery long has it possessed a charm over my fancy; and, if i dared,\\ni would breathe my wishes that the name might never change.\"\\n\\nsuch, she believed, were his words; but scarcely had she\\nreceived their sound, than her attention was caught by other sounds\\nimmediately behind her, which rendered every thing else trivial.\\nher father and lady dalrymple were speaking.\\n\\n\"a well-looking man,\" said sir walter, \"a very well-looking man.\"\\n\\n\"a very fine young man indeed!\" said lady dalrymple.  \"more air\\nthan one often sees in bath.  irish, i dare say.\"\\n\\n\"no, i just know his name.  a bowing acquaintance.  wentworth;\\ncaptain wentworth of the navy.  his sister married my tenant\\nin somersetshire, the croft, who rents kellynch.\"\\n\\nbefore sir walter had reached this point, anne\\'s eyes had caught\\nthe right direction, and distinguished captain wentworth standing\\namong a cluster of men at a little distance.  as her eyes fell on him,\\nhis seemed to be withdrawn from her.  it had that appearance.\\nit seemed as if she had been one moment too late; and as long as she\\ndared observe, he did not look again:  but the performance\\nwas recommencing, and she was forced to seem to restore her attention\\nto the orchestra and look straight forward.\\n\\nwhen she could give another glance, he had moved away.  he could not have\\ncome nearer to her if he would; she was so surrounded and shut in:\\nbut she would rather have caught his eye.\\n\\nmr elliot\\'s speech, too, distressed her.  she had no longer\\nany inclination to talk to him.  she wished him not so near her.\\n\\nthe first act was over.  now she hoped for some beneficial change;\\nand, after a period of nothing-saying amongst the party, some of them\\ndid decide on going in quest of tea.  anne was one of the few who\\ndid not choose to move.  she remained in her seat, and so did lady russell;\\nbut she had the pleasure of getting rid of mr elliot; and she did not mean,\\nwhatever she might feel on lady russell\\'s account, to shrink from\\nconversation with captain wentworth, if he gave her the opportunity.\\nshe was persuaded by lady russell\\'s countenance that she had seen him.\\n\\nhe did not come however.  anne sometimes fancied she discerned him\\nat a distance, but he never came.  the anxious interval\\nwore away unproductively.  the others returned, the room filled again,\\nbenches were reclaimed and repossessed, and another hour of pleasure\\nor of penance was to be sat out, another hour of music was to give\\ndelight or the gapes, as real or affected taste for it prevailed.\\nto anne, it chiefly wore the prospect of an hour of agitation.\\nshe could not quit that room in peace without seeing captain wentworth\\nonce more, without the interchange of one friendly look.\\n\\nin re-settling themselves there were now many changes, the result of which\\nwas favourable for her.  colonel wallis declined sitting down again,\\nand mr elliot was invited by elizabeth and miss carteret, in a manner\\nnot to be refused, to sit between them; and by some other removals,\\nand a little scheming of her own,  anne was enabled to place herself\\nmuch nearer the end of the bench than she had been before,\\nmuch more within reach of a passer-by.  she could not do so,\\nwithout comparing herself with miss larolles, the inimitable miss larolles;\\nbut still she did it, and not with much happier effect;\\nthough by what seemed prosperity in the shape of an early abdication\\nin her next neighbours, she found herself at the very end of the bench\\nbefore the concert closed.\\n\\nsuch was her situation, with a vacant space at hand, when captain wentworth\\nwas again in sight.  she saw him not far off.  he saw her too;\\nyet he looked grave, and seemed irresolute, and only by very slow degrees\\ncame at last near enough to speak to her.  she felt that something\\nmust be the matter.  the change was indubitable.  the difference\\nbetween his present air and what it had been in the octagon room\\nwas strikingly great.  why was it?  she thought of her father,\\nof lady russell.  could there have been any unpleasant glances?\\nhe began by speaking of the concert gravely, more like the captain\\nwentworth of uppercross; owned himself disappointed, had expected singing;\\nand in short, must confess that he should not be sorry when it was over.\\nanne replied, and spoke in defence of the performance so well,\\nand yet in allowance for his feelings so pleasantly, that his countenance\\nimproved, and he replied again with almost a smile.  they talked\\nfor a few minutes more; the improvement held; he even looked down\\ntowards the bench, as if he saw a place on it well worth occupying;\\nwhen at that moment a touch on her shoulder obliged anne to turn round.\\nit came from mr elliot.  he begged her pardon, but she must be applied to,\\nto explain italian again.  miss carteret was very anxious to have\\na general idea of what was next to be sung.  anne could not refuse;\\nbut never had she sacrificed to politeness with a more suffering spirit.\\n\\na few minutes, though as few as possible, were inevitably consumed;\\nand when her own mistress again, when able to turn and look\\nas she had done before, she found herself accosted by captain wentworth,\\nin a reserved yet hurried sort of farewell.  \"he must wish her good night;\\nhe was going; he should get home as fast as he could.\"\\n\\n\"is not this song worth staying for?\" said anne, suddenly struck\\nby an idea which made her yet more anxious to be encouraging.\\n\\n\"no!\" he replied impressively, \"there is nothing worth my staying for;\"\\nand he was gone directly.\\n\\njealousy of mr elliot!  it was the only intelligible motive.\\ncaptain wentworth jealous of her affection!  could she have believed it\\na week ago; three hours ago!  for a moment the gratification was exquisite.\\nbut, alas! there were very different thoughts to succeed.\\nhow was such jealousy to be quieted?  how was the truth to reach him?\\nhow, in all the peculiar disadvantages of their respective situations,\\nwould he ever learn of her real sentiments?  it was misery to think\\nof mr elliot\\'s attentions.  their evil was incalculable.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 21\\n\\n\\nanne recollected with pleasure the next morning her promise\\nof going to mrs smith, meaning that it should engage her from home\\nat the time when mr elliot would be most likely to call; for to avoid\\nmr elliot was almost a first object.\\n\\nshe felt a great deal of good-will towards him.  in spite of\\nthe mischief of his attentions, she owed him gratitude and regard,\\nperhaps compassion.  she could not help thinking much of the extraordinary\\ncircumstances attending their acquaintance, of the right which\\nhe seemed to have to interest her, by everything in situation,\\nby his own sentiments, by his early prepossession.  it was altogether\\nvery extraordinary; flattering, but painful.  there was much to regret.\\nhow she might have felt had there been no captain wentworth in the case,\\nwas not worth enquiry; for there was a captain wentworth;\\nand be the conclusion of the present suspense good or bad,\\nher affection would be his for ever.  their union, she believed,\\ncould not divide her more from other men, than their final separation.\\n\\nprettier musings of high-wrought love and eternal constancy,\\ncould never have passed along the streets of bath, than anne\\nwas sporting with from camden place to westgate buildings.\\nit was almost enough to spread purification and perfume all the way.\\n\\nshe was sure of a pleasant reception; and her friend seemed this morning\\nparticularly obliged to her for coming, seemed hardly to have expected her,\\nthough it had been an appointment.\\n\\nan account of the concert was immediately claimed; and anne\\'s recollections\\nof the concert were quite happy enough to animate her features\\nand make her rejoice to talk of it.  all that she could tell\\nshe told most gladly, but the all was little for one who had been there,\\nand unsatisfactory for such an enquirer as mrs smith, who had\\nalready heard, through the short cut of a laundress and a waiter,\\nrather more of the general success and produce of the evening\\nthan anne could relate, and who now asked in vain for several particulars\\nof the company.  everybody of any consequence or notoriety in bath\\nwas well know by name to mrs smith.\\n\\n\"the little durands were there, i conclude,\" said she, \"with their mouths\\nopen to catch the music, like unfledged sparrows ready to be fed.\\nthey never miss a concert.\"\\n\\n\"yes; i did not see them myself, but i heard mr elliot say they were\\nin the room.\"\\n\\n\"the ibbotsons, were they there? and the two new beauties,\\nwith the tall irish officer, who is talked of for one of them.\"\\n\\n\"i do not know.  i do not think they were.\"\\n\\n\"old lady mary maclean?  i need not ask after her.  she never misses,\\ni know; and you must have seen her.  she must have been in your own circle;\\nfor as you went with lady dalrymple, you were in the seats of grandeur,\\nround the orchestra, of course.\"\\n\\n\"no, that was what i dreaded.  it would have been very unpleasant to me\\nin every respect.  but happily lady dalrymple always chooses\\nto be farther off; and we were exceedingly well placed, that is,\\nfor hearing; i must not say for seeing, because i appear to have seen\\nvery little.\"\\n\\n\"oh! you saw enough for your own amusement.  i can understand.\\nthere is a sort of domestic enjoyment to be known even in a crowd,\\nand this you had.  you were a large party in yourselves,\\nand you wanted nothing beyond.\"\\n\\n\"but i ought to have looked about me more,\" said anne, conscious\\nwhile she spoke that there had in fact been no want of looking about,\\nthat the object only had been deficient.\\n\\n\"no, no; you were better employed.  you need not tell me that you\\nhad a pleasant evening.  i see it in your eye.  i perfectly see\\nhow the hours passed:  that you had always something agreeable\\nto listen to.  in the intervals of the concert it was conversation.\"\\n\\nanne half smiled and said, \"do you see that in my eye?\"\\n\\n\"yes, i do.  your countenance perfectly informs me that you were\\nin company last night with the person whom you think the most agreeable\\nin the world, the person who interests you at this present time\\nmore than all the rest of the world put together.\"\\n\\na blush overspread anne\\'s cheeks.  she could say nothing.\\n\\n\"and such being the case,\" continued mrs smith, after a short pause,\\n\"i hope you believe that i do know how to value your kindness\\nin coming to me this morning.  it is really very good of you\\nto come and sit with me, when you must have so many pleasanter demands\\nupon your time.\"\\n\\nanne heard nothing of this.  she was still in the astonishment and\\nconfusion excited by her friend\\'s penetration, unable to imagine\\nhow any report of captain wentworth could have reached her.\\nafter another short silence--\\n\\n\"pray,\" said mrs smith, \"is mr elliot aware of your acquaintance with me?\\ndoes he know that i am in bath?\"\\n\\n\"mr elliot!\" repeated anne, looking up surprised.  a moment\\'s reflection\\nshewed her the mistake she had been under.  she caught it instantaneously;\\nand recovering her courage with the feeling of safety, soon added,\\nmore composedly, \"are you acquainted with mr elliot?\"\\n\\n\"i have been a good deal acquainted with him,\" replied mrs smith, gravely,\\n\"but it seems worn out now.  it is a great while since we met.\"\\n\\n\"i was not at all aware of this.  you never mentioned it before.\\nhad i known it, i would have had the pleasure of talking to him about you.\"\\n\\n\"to confess the truth,\" said mrs smith, assuming her usual\\nair of cheerfulness, \"that is exactly the pleasure i want you to have.\\ni want you to talk about me to mr elliot.  i want your interest with him.\\nhe can be of essential service to me; and if you would have the goodness,\\nmy dear miss elliot, to make it an object to yourself,\\nof course it is done.\"\\n\\n\"i should be extremely happy; i hope you cannot doubt my willingness\\nto be of even the slightest use to you,\" replied anne; \"but i suspect\\nthat you are considering me as having a higher claim on mr elliot,\\na greater right to influence him, than is really the case.\\ni am sure you have, somehow or other, imbibed such a notion.\\nyou must consider me only as mr elliot\\'s relation.  if in that light\\nthere is anything which you suppose his cousin might fairly ask of him,\\ni beg you would not hesitate to employ me.\"\\n\\nmrs smith gave her a penetrating glance, and then, smiling, said--\\n\\n\"i have been a little premature, i perceive; i beg your pardon.\\ni ought to have waited for official information,  but now, my dear\\nmiss elliot, as an old friend, do give me a hint as to when i may speak.\\nnext week?  to be sure by next week i may be allowed to\\nthink it all settled, and build my own selfish schemes on\\nmr elliot\\'s good fortune.\"\\n\\n\"no,\" replied anne, \"nor next week, nor next, nor next.\\ni assure you that nothing of the sort you are thinking of\\nwill be settled any week.  i am not going to marry mr elliot.\\ni should like to know why you imagine i am?\"\\n\\nmrs smith looked at her again, looked earnestly, smiled,\\nshook her head, and exclaimed--\\n\\n\"now, how i do wish i understood you!  how i do wish i knew\\nwhat you were at!  i have a great idea that you do not design to be cruel,\\nwhen the right moment occurs.  till it does come, you know,\\nwe women never mean to have anybody.  it is a thing of course among us,\\nthat every man is refused, till he offers.  but why should you be cruel?\\nlet me plead for my--present friend i cannot call him, but for\\nmy former friend.  where can you look for a more suitable match?\\nwhere could you expect a more gentlemanlike, agreeable man?\\nlet me recommend mr elliot.  i am sure you hear nothing but good of him\\nfrom colonel wallis; and who can know him better than colonel wallis?\"\\n\\n\"my dear mrs smith, mr elliot\\'s wife has not been dead much above\\nhalf a year.  he ought not to be supposed to be paying his addresses\\nto any one.\"\\n\\n\"oh! if these are your only objections,\" cried mrs smith, archly,\\n\"mr elliot is safe, and i shall give myself no more trouble about him.\\ndo not forget me when you are married, that\\'s all.  let him know me to be\\na friend of yours, and then he will think little of the trouble required,\\nwhich it is very natural for him now, with so many affairs and engagements\\nof his own, to avoid and get rid of as he can; very natural, perhaps.\\nninety-nine out of a hundred would do the same.  of course,\\nhe cannot be aware of the importance to me.  well, my dear miss elliot,\\ni hope and trust you will be very happy.  mr elliot has sense\\nto understand the value of such a woman.  your peace will not be\\nshipwrecked as mine has been.  you are safe in all worldly matters,\\nand safe in his character.  he will not be led astray; he will not be\\nmisled by others to his ruin.\"\\n\\n\"no,\" said anne, \"i can readily believe all that of my cousin.\\nhe seems to have a calm decided temper, not at all open\\nto dangerous impressions.  i consider him with great respect.\\ni have no reason, from any thing that has fallen within my observation,\\nto do otherwise.  but i have not known him long; and he is not a man,\\ni think, to be known intimately soon.  will not this manner\\nof speaking of him, mrs smith, convince you that he is nothing to me?\\nsurely this must be calm enough.  and, upon my word, he is nothing to me.\\nshould he ever propose to me (which i have very little reason to imagine\\nhe has any thought of doing), i shall not accept him.  i assure you\\ni shall not.  i assure you, mr elliot had not the share which\\nyou have been supposing, in whatever pleasure the concert\\nof last night might afford:  not mr elliot; it is not mr elliot that--\"\\n\\nshe stopped, regretting with a deep blush that she had implied so much;\\nbut less would hardly have been sufficient.  mrs smith would hardly\\nhave believed so soon in mr elliot\\'s failure, but from the perception\\nof there being a somebody else.  as it was, she instantly submitted,\\nand with all the semblance of seeing nothing beyond; and anne,\\neager to escape farther notice, was impatient to know why mrs smith\\nshould have fancied she was to marry mr elliot; where she could have\\nreceived the idea, or from whom she could have heard it.\\n\\n\"do tell me how it first came into your head.\"\\n\\n\"it first came into my head,\" replied mrs smith, \"upon finding how much\\nyou were together, and feeling it to be the most probable thing\\nin the world to be wished for by everybody belonging to either of you;\\nand you may depend upon it that all your acquaintance have disposed of you\\nin the same way.  but i never heard it spoken of till two days ago.\"\\n\\n\"and has it indeed been spoken of?\"\\n\\n\"did you observe the woman who opened the door to you when\\nyou called yesterday?\"\\n\\n\"no.  was not it mrs speed, as usual, or the maid?  i observed\\nno one in particular.\"\\n\\n\"it was my friend mrs rooke; nurse rooke; who, by-the-bye,\\nhad a great curiosity to see you, and was delighted to be in the way\\nto let you in.  she came away from marlborough buildings only on sunday;\\nand she it was who told me you were to marry mr elliot.\\nshe had had it from mrs wallis herself, which did not seem bad authority.\\nshe sat an hour with me on monday evening, and gave me the whole history.\"\\n\"the whole history,\" repeated anne, laughing.  \"she could not make\\na very long history, i think, of one such little article\\nof unfounded news.\"\\n\\nmrs smith said nothing.\\n\\n\"but,\" continued anne, presently, \"though there is no truth in my having\\nthis claim on mr elliot, i should be extremely happy to be of use to you\\nin any way that i could.  shall i mention to him your being in bath?\\nshall i take any message?\"\\n\\n\"no, i thank you:  no, certainly not.  in the warmth of the moment,\\nand under a mistaken impression, i might, perhaps, have endeavoured\\nto interest you in some circumstances; but not now.  no, i thank you,\\ni have nothing to trouble you with.\"\\n\\n\"i think you spoke of having known mr elliot many years?\"\\n\\n\"i did.\"\\n\\n\"not before he was married, i suppose?\"\\n\\n\"yes; he was not married when i knew him first.\"\\n\\n\"and--were you much acquainted?\"\\n\\n\"intimately.\"\\n\\n\"indeed!  then do tell me what he was at that time of life.\\ni have a great curiosity to know what mr elliot was as a very young man.\\nwas he at all such as he appears now?\"\\n\\n\"i have not seen mr elliot these three years,\" was mrs smith\\'s answer,\\ngiven so gravely that it was impossible to pursue the subject farther;\\nand anne felt that she had gained nothing but an increase of curiosity.\\nthey were both silent:  mrs smith very thoughtful.  at last--\\n\\n\"i beg your pardon, my dear miss elliot,\" she cried, in her\\nnatural tone of cordiality, \"i beg your pardon for the short answers\\ni have been giving you, but i have been uncertain what i ought to do.\\ni have been doubting and considering as to what i ought to tell you.\\nthere were many things to be taken into the account.  one hates\\nto be officious, to be giving bad impressions, making mischief.\\neven the smooth surface of family-union seems worth preserving,\\nthough there may be nothing durable beneath.  however, i have determined;\\ni think i am right; i think you ought to be made acquainted\\nwith mr elliot\\'s real character.  though i fully believe that,\\nat present, you have not the smallest intention of accepting him,\\nthere is no saying what may happen.  you might, some time or other,\\nbe differently affected towards him.  hear the truth, therefore,\\nnow, while you are unprejudiced.  mr elliot is a man without heart\\nor conscience; a designing, wary, cold-blooded being, who thinks\\nonly of himself; whom for his own interest or ease, would be guilty\\nof any cruelty, or any treachery, that could be perpetrated without\\nrisk of his general character.  he has no feeling for others.\\nthose whom he has been the chief cause of leading into ruin,\\nhe can neglect and desert without the smallest compunction.\\nhe is totally beyond the reach of any sentiment of justice or compassion.\\noh! he is black at heart, hollow and black!\"\\n\\nanne\\'s astonished air, and exclamation of wonder, made her pause,\\nand in a calmer manner, she added,\\n\\n\"my expressions startle you.  you must allow for an injured, angry woman.\\nbut i will try to command myself.  i will not abuse him.\\ni will only tell you what i have found him.  facts shall speak.\\nhe was the intimate friend of my dear husband, who trusted and loved him,\\nand thought him as good as himself.  the intimacy had been formed\\nbefore our marriage.  i found them most intimate friends; and i, too,\\nbecame excessively pleased with mr elliot, and entertained\\nthe highest opinion of him.  at nineteen, you know, one does not\\nthink very seriously; but mr elliot appeared to me quite as good as others,\\nand much more agreeable than most others, and we were almost\\nalways together.  we were principally in town, living in very good style.\\nhe was then the inferior in circumstances; he was then the poor one;\\nhe had chambers in the temple, and it was as much as he could do\\nto support the appearance of a gentleman.  he had always a home\\nwith us whenever he chose it; he was always welcome; he was like a brother.\\nmy poor charles, who had the finest, most generous spirit in the world,\\nwould have divided his last farthing with him; and i know that his purse\\nwas open to him; i know that he often assisted him.\"\\n\\n\"this must have been about that very period of mr elliot\\'s life,\"\\nsaid anne, \"which has always excited my particular curiosity.\\nit must have been about the same time that he became known to\\nmy father and sister.  i never knew him myself; i only heard of him;\\nbut there was a something in his conduct then, with regard to\\nmy father and sister, and afterwards in the circumstances of his marriage,\\nwhich i never could quite reconcile with present times.  it seemed\\nto announce a different sort of man.\"\\n\\n\"i know it all, i know it all,\" cried mrs smith.  \"he had been\\nintroduced to sir walter and your sister before i was acquainted with him,\\nbut i heard him speak of them for ever.  i know he was invited\\nand encouraged, and i know he did not choose to go.  i can satisfy you,\\nperhaps, on points which you would little expect; and as to his marriage,\\ni knew all about it at the time.  i was privy to all the fors and againsts;\\ni was the friend to whom he confided his hopes and plans; and though\\ni did not know his wife previously, her inferior situation in society,\\nindeed, rendered that impossible, yet i knew her all her life afterwards,\\nor at least till within the last two years of her life, and can answer\\nany question you may wish to put.\"\\n\\n\"nay,\" said anne, \"i have no particular enquiry to make about her.\\ni have always understood they were not a happy couple.  but i should\\nlike to know why, at that time of his life, he should slight\\nmy father\\'s acquaintance as he did.  my father was certainly disposed\\nto take very kind and proper notice of him.  why did mr elliot draw back?\"\\n\\n\"mr elliot,\" replied mrs smith, \"at that period of his life,\\nhad one object in view:  to make his fortune, and by a rather quicker\\nprocess than the law.  he was determined to make it by marriage.\\nhe was determined, at least, not to mar it by an imprudent marriage;\\nand i know it was his belief (whether justly or not, of course\\ni cannot decide), that your father and sister, in their civilities\\nand invitations, were designing a match between the heir\\nand the young lady, and it was impossible that such a match\\nshould have answered his ideas of wealth and independence.\\nthat was his motive for drawing back, i can assure you.\\nhe told me the whole story.  he had no concealments with me.\\nit was curious, that having just left you behind me in bath,\\nmy first and principal acquaintance on marrying should be your cousin;\\nand that, through him, i should be continually hearing of your father\\nand sister.  he described one miss elliot, and i thought\\nvery affectionately of the other.\"\\n\\n\"perhaps,\" cried anne, struck by a sudden idea, \"you sometimes\\nspoke of me to mr elliot?\"\\n\\n\"to be sure i did; very often.  i used to boast of my own anne elliot,\\nand vouch for your being a very different creature from--\"\\n\\nshe checked herself just in time.\\n\\n\"this accounts for something which mr elliot said last night,\"\\ncried anne.  \"this explains it.  i found he had been used to hear of me.\\ni could not comprehend how.  what wild imaginations one forms where\\ndear self is concerned!  how sure to be mistaken!  but i beg your pardon;\\ni have interrupted you.  mr elliot married then completely for money?\\nthe circumstances, probably, which first opened your eyes\\nto his character.\"\\n\\nmrs smith hesitated a little here.  \"oh! those things are too common.\\nwhen one lives in the world, a man or woman\\'s marrying for money\\nis too common to strike one as it ought.  i was very young,\\nand associated only with the young, and we were a thoughtless,\\ngay set, without any strict rules of conduct.  we lived for enjoyment.\\ni think differently now; time and sickness and sorrow have given me\\nother notions; but at that period i must own i saw nothing reprehensible\\nin what mr elliot was doing.  `to do the best for himself,\\'\\npassed as a duty.\"\\n\\n\"but was not she a very low woman?\"\\n\\n\"yes; which i objected to, but he would not regard.  money, money,\\nwas all that he wanted.  her father was a grazier, her grandfather\\nhad been a butcher, but that was all nothing.  she was a fine woman,\\nhad had a decent education, was brought forward by some cousins,\\nthrown by chance into mr elliot\\'s company, and fell in love with him;\\nand not a difficulty or a scruple was there on his side,\\nwith respect to her birth.  all his caution was spent in being secured\\nof the real amount of her fortune, before he committed himself.\\ndepend upon it, whatever esteem mr elliot may have for his own situation\\nin life now, as a young man he had not the smallest value for it.\\nhis chance for the kellynch estate was something, but all the honour\\nof the family he held as cheap as dirt.  i have often heard him declare,\\nthat if baronetcies were saleable, anybody should have his\\nfor fifty pounds, arms and motto, name and livery included;\\nbut i will not pretend to repeat half that i used to hear him say\\non that subject.  it would not be fair; and yet you ought to have proof,\\nfor what is all this but assertion, and you shall have proof.\"\\n\\n\"indeed, my dear mrs smith, i want none,\" cried anne.  \"you have asserted\\nnothing contradictory to what mr elliot appeared to be some years ago.\\nthis is all in confirmation, rather, of what we used to hear and believe.\\ni am more curious to know why he should be so different now.\"\\n\\n\"but for my satisfaction, if you will have the goodness to ring for mary;\\nstay:  i am sure you will have the still greater goodness of\\ngoing yourself into my bedroom, and bringing me the small inlaid box\\nwhich you will find on the upper shelf of the closet.\"\\n\\nanne, seeing her friend to be earnestly bent on it, did as she was desired.\\nthe box was brought and placed before her, and mrs smith, sighing over it\\nas she unlocked it, said--\\n\\n\"this is full of papers belonging to him, to my husband;\\na small portion only of what i had to look over when i lost him.\\nthe letter i am looking for was one written by mr elliot to him\\nbefore our marriage, and happened to be saved; why, one can hardly imagine.\\nbut he was careless and immethodical, like other men, about those things;\\nand when i came to examine his papers, i found it with others\\nstill more trivial, from different people scattered here and there,\\nwhile many letters and memorandums of real importance had been destroyed.\\nhere it is; i would not burn it, because being even then very little\\nsatisfied with mr elliot, i was determined to preserve every document\\nof former intimacy.  i have now another motive for being glad\\nthat i can produce it.\"\\n\\nthis was the letter, directed to \"charles smith, esq. tunbridge wells,\"\\nand dated from london, as far back as july, 1803: --\\n\\n\"dear smith,--i have received yours.  your kindness almost overpowers me.\\ni wish nature had made such hearts as yours more common, but i have\\nlived three-and-twenty years in the world, and have seen none like it.\\nat present, believe me, i have no need of your services,\\nbeing in cash again.  give me joy:  i have got rid of sir walter and miss.\\nthey are gone back to kellynch, and almost made me swear to visit them\\nthis summer; but my first visit to kellynch will be with a surveyor,\\nto tell me how to bring it with best advantage to the hammer.\\nthe baronet, nevertheless, is not unlikely to marry again;\\nhe is quite fool enough.  if he does, however, they will leave me in peace,\\nwhich may be a decent equivalent  for the reversion.  he is worse\\nthan last year.\\n\\n\"i wish i had any name but elliot.  i am sick of it.  the name of walter\\ni can drop, thank god! and i desire you will never insult me\\nwith my second w. again, meaning, for the rest of my life,\\nto be only yours truly,--wm. elliot.\"\\n\\nsuch a letter could not be read without putting anne in a glow;\\nand mrs smith, observing the high colour in her face, said--\\n\\n\"the language, i know, is highly disrespectful.  though i have forgot\\nthe exact terms, i have a perfect impression of the general meaning.\\nbut it shows you the man.  mark his professions to my poor husband.\\ncan any thing be stronger?\"\\n\\nanne could not immediately get over the shock and mortification\\nof finding such words applied to her father.  she was obliged to recollect\\nthat her seeing the letter was a violation of the laws of honour,\\nthat no one ought to be judged or to be known by such testimonies,\\nthat no private correspondence could bear the eye of others,\\nbefore she could recover calmness enough to return the letter\\nwhich she had been meditating over, and say--\\n\\n\"thank you.  this is full proof undoubtedly; proof of every thing\\nyou were saying.  but why be acquainted with us now?\"\\n\\n\"i can explain this too,\" cried mrs smith, smiling.\\n\\n\"can you really?\"\\n\\n\"yes.  i have shewn you mr elliot as he was a dozen years ago,\\nand i will shew him as he is now.  i cannot produce written proof again,\\nbut i can give as authentic oral testimony as you can desire, of what\\nhe is now wanting, and what he is now doing.  he is no hypocrite now.\\nhe truly wants to marry you.  his present attentions to your family\\nare very sincere:  quite from the heart.  i will give you my authority:\\nhis friend colonel wallis.\"\\n\\n\"colonel wallis! you are acquainted with him?\"\\n\\n\"no.  it does not come to me in quite so direct a line as that;\\nit takes a bend or two, but nothing of consequence.  the stream\\nis as good as at first; the little rubbish it collects in the turnings\\nis easily moved away.  mr elliot talks unreservedly to colonel wallis\\nof his views on you, which said colonel wallis, i imagine to be,\\nin himself, a sensible, careful, discerning sort of character;\\nbut colonel wallis has a very pretty silly wife, to whom\\nhe tells things which he had better not, and he repeats it all to her.\\nshe in the overflowing spirits of her recovery, repeats it all\\nto her nurse; and the nurse  knowing my acquaintance with you,\\nvery naturally brings it all to me.  on monday evening, my good friend\\nmrs rooke let me thus much into the secrets of marlborough buildings.\\nwhen i talked of a whole history, therefore, you see i was\\nnot romancing so much as you supposed.\"\\n\\n\"my dear mrs smith, your authority is deficient.  this will not do.\\nmr elliot\\'s having any views on me will not in the least account\\nfor the efforts he made towards a reconciliation with my father.\\nthat was all prior to my coming to bath.  i found them on\\nthe most friendly terms when i arrived.\"\\n\\n\"i know you did; i know it all perfectly, but--\"\\n\\n\"indeed, mrs smith, we must not expect to get real information\\nin such a line.  facts or opinions which are to pass through the hands\\nof so many, to be misconceived by folly in one, and ignorance in another,\\ncan hardly have much truth left.\"\\n\\n\"only give me a hearing.  you will soon be able to judge of\\nthe general credit due, by listening to some particulars\\nwhich you can yourself immediately contradict or confirm.\\nnobody supposes that you were his first inducement.  he had seen you\\nindeed, before he came to bath, and admired you, but without\\nknowing it to be you.  so says my historian, at least.  is this true?\\ndid he see you last summer or autumn, `somewhere down in the west,\\'\\nto use her own words, without knowing it to be you?\"\\n\\n\"he certainly did.  so far it is very true.  at lyme.\\ni happened to be at lyme.\"\\n\\n\"well,\" continued mrs smith, triumphantly, \"grant my friend the credit\\ndue to the establishment of the first point asserted.  he saw you then\\nat lyme, and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleased\\nto meet with you again in camden place, as miss anne elliot,\\nand from that moment, i have no doubt, had a double motive\\nin his visits there.  but there was another, and an earlier,\\nwhich i will now explain.  if there is anything in my story which you know\\nto be either false or improbable, stop me.  my account states,\\nthat your sister\\'s friend, the lady now staying with you,\\nwhom i have heard you mention, came to bath with miss elliot and sir walter\\nas long ago as september (in short when they first came themselves),\\nand has been staying there ever since; that she is a clever, insinuating,\\nhandsome woman, poor and plausible, and altogether such in situation\\nand manner, as to give a general idea, among sir walter\\'s acquaintance,\\nof her meaning to be lady elliot, and as general a surprise\\nthat miss elliot should be apparently, blind to the danger.\"\\n\\nhere mrs smith paused a moment; but anne had not a word to say,\\nand she continued--\\n\\n\"this was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family,\\nlong before you returned to it; and colonel wallis had his eye\\nupon your father enough to be sensible of it, though he did not then\\nvisit in camden place; but his regard for mr elliot gave him an interest\\nin watching all that was going on there, and when mr elliot came to bath\\nfor a day or two, as he happened to do a little before christmas,\\ncolonel wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of things,\\nand the reports beginning to prevail.  now you are to understand,\\nthat time had worked a very material change in mr elliot\\'s opinions\\nas to the value of a baronetcy.  upon all points of blood and connexion\\nhe is a completely altered man.  having long had as much money\\nas he could spend, nothing to wish for on the side of avarice\\nor indulgence, he has been gradually learning to pin his happiness\\nupon the consequence he is heir to.  i thought it coming on\\nbefore our acquaintance ceased, but it is now a confirmed feeling.\\nhe cannot bear the idea of not being sir william.  you may guess,\\ntherefore, that the news he heard from his friend could not be\\nvery agreeable, and you may guess what it produced; the resolution\\nof coming back to bath as soon as possible, and of fixing himself here\\nfor a time, with the view of renewing his former acquaintance,\\nand recovering such a footing in the family as might give him the means\\nof ascertaining the degree of his danger, and of circumventing the lady\\nif he found it material.  this was agreed upon between the two friends\\nas the only thing to be done; and colonel wallis was to assist\\nin every way that he could.  he was to be introduced, and mrs wallis\\nwas to be introduced, and everybody was to be introduced.\\nmr elliot came back accordingly; and on application was forgiven,\\nas you know, and re-admitted into the family; and there it was\\nhis constant object, and his only object (till your arrival\\nadded another motive), to watch sir walter and mrs clay.\\nhe omitted no opportunity of being with them, threw himself in their way,\\ncalled at all hours; but i need not be particular on this subject.\\nyou can imagine what an artful man would do; and with this guide,\\nperhaps, may recollect what you have seen him do.\"\\n\\n\"yes,\" said anne, \"you tell me nothing which does not accord with\\nwhat i have known, or could imagine.  there is always something offensive\\nin the details of cunning.  the manoeuvres of selfishness and duplicity\\nmust ever be revolting, but i have heard nothing which really surprises me.\\ni know those who would be shocked by such a representation of mr elliot,\\nwho would have difficulty in believing it; but i have never been satisfied.\\ni have always wanted some other motive for his conduct than appeared.\\ni should like to know his present opinion, as to the probability\\nof the event he has been in dread of; whether he considers the danger\\nto be lessening or not.\"\\n\\n\"lessening, i understand,\" replied mrs smith.  \"he thinks mrs clay\\nafraid of him, aware that he sees through her, and not daring to proceed\\nas she might do in his absence.  but since he must be absent\\nsome time or other, i do not perceive how he can ever be secure\\nwhile she holds her present influence.  mrs wallis has an amusing idea,\\nas nurse tells me, that it is to be put into the marriage articles\\nwhen you and mr elliot marry, that your father is not to marry mrs clay.\\na scheme, worthy of mrs wallis\\'s understanding, by all accounts;\\nbut my sensible nurse rooke sees the absurdity of it.  `why, to be sure,\\nma\\'am,\\' said she, `it would not prevent his marrying anybody else.\\'\\nand, indeed, to own the truth, i do not think nurse, in her heart,\\nis a very strenuous opposer of sir walter\\'s making a second match.\\nshe must be allowed to be a favourer of matrimony, you know;\\nand (since self will intrude) who can say that she may not have\\nsome flying visions of attending the next lady elliot, through\\nmrs wallis\\'s recommendation?\"\\n\\n\"i am very glad to know all this,\" said anne, after a little\\nthoughtfulness.  \"it will be more painful to me in some respects\\nto be in company with him, but i shall know better what to do.\\nmy line of conduct will be more direct.  mr elliot is evidently\\na disingenuous, artificial, worldly man, who has never had\\nany better principle to guide him than selfishness.\"\\n\\nbut mr elliot was not done with.  mrs smith had been carried away\\nfrom her first direction, and anne had forgotten, in the interest\\nof her own family concerns, how much had been originally implied\\nagainst him; but her attention was now called to the explanation\\nof those first hints, and she listened to a recital which,\\nif it did not perfectly justify the unqualified bitterness of mrs smith,\\nproved him to have been very unfeeling in his conduct towards her;\\nvery deficient both in justice and compassion.\\n\\nshe learned that (the intimacy between them continuing unimpaired\\nby mr elliot\\'s marriage) they had been as before always together,\\nand mr elliot had led his friend into expenses much beyond his fortune.\\nmrs smith did not want to take blame to herself, and was most tender\\nof throwing any on her husband; but anne could collect that their income\\nhad never been equal to their style of living, and that from the first\\nthere had been a great deal of general and joint extravagance.\\nfrom his wife\\'s account of him she could discern mr smith to have been\\na man of warm feelings, easy temper, careless habits, and not strong\\nunderstanding, much more amiable than his friend, and very unlike him,\\nled by him, and probably despised by him.  mr elliot, raised by\\nhis marriage to great affluence, and disposed to every gratification\\nof pleasure and vanity which could be commanded without involving himself,\\n(for with all his self-indulgence he had become a prudent man),\\nand beginning to be rich, just as his friend ought to have found himself\\nto be poor, seemed to have had no concern at all for that friend\\'s\\nprobable finances, but, on the contrary, had been prompting and\\nencouraging expenses which could end only in ruin; and the smiths\\naccordingly had been ruined.\\n\\nthe husband had died just in time to be spared the full knowledge of it.\\nthey had previously known embarrassments enough to try the friendship\\nof their friends, and to prove that mr elliot\\'s had better not be tried;\\nbut it was not till his death that the wretched state of his affairs\\nwas fully known.  with a confidence in mr elliot\\'s regard,\\nmore creditable to his feelings than his judgement, mr smith had\\nappointed him the executor of his will; but mr elliot would not act,\\nand the difficulties and distress which this refusal had heaped on her,\\nin addition to the inevitable sufferings of her situation, had been such\\nas could not be related without anguish of spirit, or listened to\\nwithout corresponding indignation.\\n\\nanne was shewn some letters of his on the occasion, answers to\\nurgent applications from mrs smith, which all breathed the same\\nstern resolution of not engaging in a fruitless trouble, and,\\nunder a cold civility, the same hard-hearted indifference\\nto any of the evils it might bring on her.  it was a dreadful picture\\nof ingratitude and inhumanity; and anne felt, at some moments,\\nthat no flagrant open crime could have been worse.  she had a great deal\\nto listen to; all the particulars of past sad scenes, all the minutiae\\nof distress upon distress, which in former conversations had been\\nmerely hinted at, were dwelt on now with a natural indulgence.\\nanne could perfectly comprehend the exquisite relief, and was only\\nthe more inclined to wonder at the composure of her friend\\'s\\nusual state of mind.\\n\\nthere was one circumstance in the history of her grievances\\nof particular irritation.  she had good reason to believe that\\nsome property of her husband in the west indies, which had been\\nfor many years under a sort of sequestration for the payment\\nof its own incumbrances, might be recoverable by proper measures;\\nand this property, though not large, would be enough to make\\nher comparatively rich.  but there was nobody to stir in it.\\nmr elliot would do nothing, and she could do nothing herself,\\nequally disabled from personal exertion by her state of\\nbodily weakness, and from employing others by her want of money.\\nshe had no natural connexions to assist her even with their counsel,\\nand she could not afford to purchase the assistance of the law.\\nthis was a cruel aggravation of actually straitened means.\\nto feel that she ought to be in better circumstances,\\nthat a little trouble in the right place might do it,\\nand to fear that delay might be even weakening her claims,\\nwas hard to bear.\\n\\nit was on this point that she had hoped to engage anne\\'s good offices\\nwith mr elliot.  she had previously, in the anticipation\\nof their marriage, been very apprehensive of losing her friend by it;\\nbut on being assured that he could have made no attempt of that nature,\\nsince he did not even know her to be in bath, it immediately occurred,\\nthat something might be done in her favour by the influence of the woman\\nhe loved, and she had been hastily preparing to interest anne\\'s feelings,\\nas far as the observances due to mr elliot\\'s character would allow,\\nwhen anne\\'s refutation of the supposed engagement changed\\nthe face of everything; and while it took from her the new-formed hope\\nof succeeding in the object of her first anxiety, left her at least\\nthe comfort of telling the whole story her own way.\\n\\nafter listening to this full description of mr elliot, anne could not but\\nexpress some surprise at mrs smith\\'s having spoken of him so favourably\\nin the beginning of their conversation.  \"she had seemed to recommend\\nand praise him!\"\\n\\n\"my dear,\" was mrs smith\\'s reply, \"there was nothing else to be done.\\ni considered your marrying him as certain, though he might not yet\\nhave made the offer, and i could no more speak the truth of him,\\nthan if he had been your husband.  my heart bled for you,\\nas i talked of happiness; and yet he is sensible, he is agreeable,\\nand with such a woman as you, it was not absolutely hopeless.\\nhe was very unkind to his first wife.  they were wretched together.\\nbut she was too ignorant and giddy for respect, and he had never loved her.\\ni was willing to hope that you must fare better.\"\\n\\nanne could just acknowledge within herself such a possibility\\nof having been induced to marry him, as made her shudder at the idea\\nof the misery which must have followed.  it was just possible that\\nshe might have been persuaded by lady russell!  and under such\\na supposition, which would have been most miserable, when time had\\ndisclosed all, too late?\\n\\nit was very desirable that lady russell should be no longer deceived;\\nand one of the concluding arrangements of this important conference,\\nwhich carried them through the greater part of the morning,\\nwas, that anne had full liberty to communicate to her friend\\neverything relative to mrs smith, in which his conduct was involved.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 22\\n\\n\\nanne went home to think over all that she had heard.  in one point,\\nher feelings were relieved by this knowledge of mr elliot.\\nthere was no longer anything of tenderness due to him.  he stood as\\nopposed to captain wentworth, in all his own unwelcome obtrusiveness;\\nand the evil of his attentions last night, the irremediable mischief\\nhe might have done, was considered with sensations unqualified, unperplexed.\\npity for him was all over.  but this was the only point of relief.\\nin every other respect, in looking around her, or penetrating forward,\\nshe saw more to distrust and to apprehend.  she was concerned\\nfor the disappointment and pain lady russell would be feeling;\\nfor the mortifications which must be hanging over her father and sister,\\nand had all the distress of foreseeing many evils, without knowing\\nhow to avert any one of them.  she was most thankful for her own\\nknowledge of him.  she had never considered herself as entitled to reward\\nfor not slighting an old friend like mrs smith, but here was\\na reward indeed springing from it!  mrs smith had been able to tell her\\nwhat no one else could have done.  could the knowledge have\\nbeen extended through her family?  but this was a vain idea.\\nshe must talk to lady russell, tell her, consult with her,\\nand having done her best, wait the event with as much composure\\nas possible; and after all, her greatest want of composure would be\\nin that quarter of the mind which could not be opened to lady russell;\\nin that flow of anxieties and fears which must be all to herself.\\n\\n\\nshe found, on reaching home, that she had, as she intended,\\nescaped seeing mr elliot; that he had called and paid them\\na long morning visit; but hardly had she congratulated herself,\\nand felt safe, when she heard that he was coming again in the evening.\\n\\n\"i had not the smallest intention of asking him,\" said elizabeth,\\nwith affected carelessness, \"but he gave so many hints;\\nso mrs clay says, at least.\"\\n\\n\"indeed, i do say it.  i never saw anybody in my life spell harder\\nfor an invitation.  poor man!  i was really in pain for him;\\nfor your hard-hearted sister, miss anne, seems bent on cruelty.\"\\n\\n\"oh!\" cried elizabeth, \"i have been rather too much used to the game\\nto be soon overcome by a gentleman\\'s hints.  however, when i found\\nhow excessively he was regretting that he should miss my father\\nthis morning, i gave way immediately, for i would never really omit\\nan opportunity of bring him and sir walter together.  they appear to\\nso much advantage in company with each other.  each behaving so pleasantly.\\nmr elliot looking up with so much respect.\"\\n\\n\"quite delightful!\" cried mrs clay, not daring, however,\\nto turn her eyes towards anne.  \"exactly like father and son!\\ndear miss elliot, may i not say father and son?\"\\n\\n\"oh! i lay no embargo on any body\\'s words.  if you will have such\\nideas!  but, upon my word, i am scarcely sensible of his attentions\\nbeing beyond those of other men.\"\\n\\n\"my dear miss elliot!\" exclaimed mrs clay, lifting her hands and eyes,\\nand sinking all the rest of her astonishment in a convenient silence.\\n\\n\"well, my dear penelope, you need not be so alarmed about him.\\ni did invite him, you know.  i sent him away with smiles.\\nwhen i found he was really going to his friends at thornberry park\\nfor the whole day to-morrow, i had compassion on him.\"\\n\\nanne admired the good acting of the friend, in being able to shew\\nsuch pleasure as she did, in the expectation and in the actual arrival\\nof the very person whose presence must really be interfering with\\nher prime object.  it was impossible but that mrs clay must hate\\nthe sight of mr elliot; and yet she could assume a most obliging,\\nplacid look, and appear quite satisfied with the curtailed license\\nof devoting herself only half as much to sir walter as she would have\\ndone otherwise.\\n\\nto anne herself it was most distressing to see mr elliot enter the room;\\nand quite painful to have him approach and speak to her.\\nshe had been used before to feel that he could not be always quite sincere,\\nbut now she saw insincerity in everything.  his attentive deference\\nto her father, contrasted with his former language, was odious;\\nand when she thought of his cruel conduct towards mrs smith,\\nshe could hardly bear the sight of his present smiles and mildness,\\nor the sound of his artificial good sentiments.\\n\\nshe meant to avoid any such alteration of manners as might provoke\\na remonstrance on his side.  it was a great object to her to escape\\nall enquiry or eclat; but it was her intention to be as decidedly cool\\nto him as might be compatible with their relationship; and to retrace,\\nas quietly as she could, the few steps of unnecessary intimacy she had\\nbeen gradually led along.  she was accordingly more guarded,\\nand more cool, than she had been the night before.\\n\\nhe wanted to animate her curiosity again as to how and where\\nhe could have heard her formerly praised; wanted very much\\nto be gratified by more solicitation; but the charm was broken:\\nhe found that the heat and animation of a public room was necessary\\nto kindle his modest cousin\\'s vanity; he found, at least, that it was\\nnot to be done now, by any of those attempts which he could hazard\\namong the too-commanding claims of the others.  he little surmised\\nthat it was a subject acting now exactly against his interest,\\nbringing immediately to her thoughts all those parts of his conduct\\nwhich were least excusable.\\n\\nshe had some satisfaction in finding that he was really going out of bath\\nthe next morning, going early, and that he would be gone the greater part\\nof two days.  he was invited again to camden place the very evening of\\nhis return; but from thursday to saturday evening his absence was certain.\\nit was bad enough that a mrs clay should be always before her;\\nbut that a deeper hypocrite should be added to their party,\\nseemed the destruction of everything like peace and comfort.\\nit was so humiliating to reflect on the constant deception practised\\non her father and elizabeth; to consider the various sources\\nof mortification preparing for them!  mrs clay\\'s selfishness was\\nnot so complicate nor so revolting as his; and anne would have compounded\\nfor the marriage at once, with all its evils, to be clear of mr elliot\\'s\\nsubtleties in endeavouring to prevent it.\\n\\non friday morning she meant to go very early to lady russell,\\nand accomplish the necessary communication; and she would have gone\\ndirectly after breakfast, but that mrs clay was also going out\\non some obliging purpose of saving her sister trouble, which\\ndetermined her to wait till she might be safe from such a companion.\\nshe saw mrs clay fairly off, therefore, before she began to talk\\nof spending the morning in rivers street.\\n\\n\"very well,\" said elizabeth, \"i have nothing to send but my love.\\noh! you may as well take back that tiresome book she would lend me,\\nand pretend i have read it through.  i really cannot be plaguing myself\\nfor ever with all the new poems and states of the nation that come out.\\nlady russell quite bores one with her new publications.\\nyou need not tell her so, but i thought her dress hideous the other night.\\ni used to think she had some taste in dress, but i was ashamed of her\\nat the concert.  something so formal and arrange in her air!\\nand she sits so upright!  my best love, of course.\"\\n\\n\"and mine,\" added sir walter.  \"kindest regards.  and you may say,\\nthat i mean to call upon her soon.  make a civil message;\\nbut i shall only leave my card.  morning visits are never fair\\nby women at her time of life, who make themselves up so little.\\nif she would only wear rouge she would not be afraid of being seen;\\nbut last time i called, i observed the blinds were let down immediately.\"\\n\\nwhile her father spoke, there was a knock at the door.  who could it be?\\nanne, remembering the preconcerted visits, at all hours, of mr elliot,\\nwould have expected him, but for his known engagement seven miles off.\\nafter the usual period of suspense, the usual sounds of approach were heard,\\nand \"mr and mrs charles musgrove\" were ushered into the room.\\n\\nsurprise was the strongest emotion raised by their appearance;\\nbut anne was really glad to see them; and the others were not so sorry\\nbut that they could put on a decent air of welcome; and as soon\\nas it became clear that these, their nearest relations, were not arrived\\nwith an views of accommodation in that house, sir walter and elizabeth\\nwere able to rise in cordiality, and do the honours of it very well.\\nthey were come to bath for a few days with mrs musgrove, and were\\nat the white hart.  so much was pretty soon understood;\\nbut till sir walter and elizabeth were walking mary into\\nthe other drawing-room, and regaling themselves with her admiration,\\nanne could not draw upon charles\\'s brain for a regular history\\nof their coming, or an explanation of some smiling hints\\nof particular business, which had been ostentatiously dropped by mary,\\nas well as of some apparent confusion as to whom their party consisted of.\\n\\nshe then found that it consisted of mrs musgrove, henrietta,\\nand captain harville, beside their two selves.  he gave her a very plain,\\nintelligible account of the whole; a narration in which she saw\\na great deal of most characteristic proceeding.  the scheme\\nhad received its first impulse by captain harville\\'s wanting to\\ncome to bath on business.  he had begun to talk of it a week ago;\\nand by way of doing something, as shooting was over, charles had proposed\\ncoming with him, and mrs harville had seemed to like the idea of it\\nvery much, as an advantage to her husband; but mary could not bear\\nto be left, and had made herself so unhappy about it, that for a day or two\\neverything seemed to be in suspense, or at an end.  but then,\\nit had been taken up by his father and mother.  his mother had\\nsome old friends in bath whom she wanted to see; it was thought\\na good opportunity for henrietta to come and buy wedding-clothes\\nfor herself and her sister; and, in short, it ended in being\\nhis mother\\'s party, that everything might be comfortable and easy\\nto captain harville; and he and mary were included in it\\nby way of general convenience.  they had arrived late the night before.\\nmrs harville, her children, and captain benwick, remained with\\nmr musgrove and louisa at uppercross.\\n\\nanne\\'s only surprise was, that affairs should be in forwardness enough\\nfor henrietta\\'s wedding-clothes to be talked of.  she had imagined\\nsuch difficulties of fortune to exist there as must prevent\\nthe marriage from being near at hand; but she learned from charles that,\\nvery recently, (since mary\\'s last letter to herself), charles hayter\\nhad been applied to by a friend to hold a living for a youth\\nwho could not possibly claim it under many years; and that\\non the strength of his present income, with almost a certainty\\nof something more permanent long before the term in question,\\nthe two families had consented to the young people\\'s wishes,\\nand that their marriage was likely to take place in a few months,\\nquite as soon as louisa\\'s.  \"and a very good living it was,\"\\ncharles added:  \"only five-and-twenty miles from uppercross,\\nand in a very fine country:   fine part of dorsetshire.\\nin the centre of some of the best preserves in the kingdom,\\nsurrounded by three great proprietors, each more careful and jealous\\nthan the other; and to two of the three at least, charles hayter might get\\na special recommendation.  not that he will value it as he ought,\"\\nhe observed, \"charles is too cool about sporting. that\\'s the worst of him.\"\\n\\n\"i am extremely glad, indeed,\" cried anne, \"particularly glad\\nthat this should happen; and that of two sisters, who both deserve\\nequally well, and who have always been such good friends,\\nthe pleasant prospect of one should not be dimming those of the other--\\nthat they should be so equal in their prosperity and comfort.\\ni hope your father and mother are quite happy with regard to both.\"\\n\\n\"oh! yes.  my father would be well pleased if the gentlemen were richer,\\nbut he has no other fault to find.  money, you know, coming down with\\nmoney--two daughters at once--it cannot be a very agreeable operation,\\nand it streightens him as to many things.  however, i do not mean to say\\nthey have not a right to it.  it is very fit they should have\\ndaughters\\' shares; and i am sure he has always been a very kind,\\nliberal father to me.  mary does not above half like henrietta\\'s match.\\nshe never did, you know.  but she does not do him justice,\\nnor think enough about winthrop.  i cannot make her attend to\\nthe value of the property.  it is a very fair match, as times go;\\nand i have liked charles hayter all my life, and i shall not leave off now.\"\\n\\n\"such excellent parents as mr and mrs musgrove,\" exclaimed anne,\\n\"should be happy in their children\\'s marriages.  they do everything\\nto confer happiness, i am sure.  what a blessing to young people\\nto be in such hands!  your father and mother seem so totally free\\nfrom all those ambitious feelings which have led to so much misconduct\\nand misery, both in young and old.  i hope you think louisa\\nperfectly recovered now?\"\\n\\nhe answered rather hesitatingly, \"yes, i believe i do; very much recovered;\\nbut she is altered; there is no running or jumping about, no laughing\\nor dancing; it is quite different.  if one happens only to shut the door\\na little hard, she starts and wriggles like a young dab-chick in the water;\\nand benwick sits at her elbow, reading verses, or whispering to her,\\nall day long.\"\\n\\nanne could not help laughing.  \"that cannot be much to your taste,\\ni know,\" said she; \"but i do believe him to be an excellent young man.\"\\n\\n\"to be sure he is.  nobody doubts it; and i hope you do not think\\ni am so illiberal as to want every man to have the same objects and\\npleasures as myself.  i have a great value for benwick; and when one can\\nbut get him to talk, he has plenty to say.  his reading has done him\\nno harm, for he has fought as well as read.  he is a brave fellow.\\ni got more acquainted with him last monday than ever i did before.\\nwe had a famous set-to at rat-hunting all the morning in\\nmy father\\'s great barns; and he played his part so well\\nthat i have liked him the better ever since.\"\\n\\nhere they were interrupted by the absolute necessity of charles\\'s\\nfollowing the others to admire mirrors and china; but anne had\\nheard enough to understand the present state of uppercross,\\nand rejoice in its happiness; and though she sighed as she rejoiced,\\nher sigh had none of the ill-will of envy in it.  she would certainly\\nhave risen to their blessings if she could, but she did not want\\nto lessen theirs.\\n\\nthe visit passed off altogether in high good humour.  mary was\\nin excellent spirits, enjoying the gaiety and the change,\\nand so well satisfied with the journey in her mother-in-law\\'s carriage\\nwith four horses, and with her own complete independence of camden place,\\nthat she was exactly in a temper to admire everything as she ought,\\nand enter most readily into all the superiorities of the house,\\nas they were detailed to her.  she had no demands on her father or sister,\\nand her consequence was just enough increased by their handsome\\ndrawing-rooms.\\n\\nelizabeth was, for a short time, suffering a good deal.\\nshe felt that mrs musgrove and all her party ought to be asked\\nto dine with them; but she could not bear to have the difference of style,\\nthe reduction of servants, which a dinner must betray, witnessed by those\\nwho had been always so inferior to the elliots of kellynch.\\nit was a struggle between propriety and vanity; but vanity got the better,\\nand then elizabeth was happy again.  these were her internal persuasions:\\n\"old fashioned notions; country hospitality; we do not profess\\nto give dinners; few people in bath do; lady alicia never does;\\ndid not even ask her own sister\\'s family, though they were here a month:\\nand i dare say it would be very inconvenient to mrs musgrove;\\nput her quite out of her way.  i am sure she would rather not come;\\nshe cannot feel easy with us.  i will ask them all for an evening;\\nthat will be much better; that will be a novelty and a treat.\\nthey have not seen two such drawing rooms before.  they will be delighted\\nto come to-morrow evening.  it shall be a regular party, small,\\nbut most elegant.\"  and this satisfied elizabeth:  and when the invitation\\nwas given to the two present, and promised for the absent,\\nmary was as completely satisfied.  she was particularly asked\\nto meet mr elliot, and be introduced to lady dalrymple and miss carteret,\\nwho were fortunately already engaged to come; and she could not\\nhave received a more gratifying attention.  miss elliot was to have\\nthe honour of calling on mrs musgrove in the course of the morning;\\nand anne walked off with charles and mary, to go and see her\\nand henrietta directly.\\n\\nher plan of sitting with lady russell must give way for the present.\\nthey all three called in rivers street for a couple of minutes;\\nbut anne convinced herself that a day\\'s delay of the intended communication\\ncould be of no consequence, and hastened forward to the white hart,\\nto see again the friends and companions of the last autumn,\\nwith an eagerness of good-will which many associations contributed to form.\\n\\nthey found mrs musgrove and her daughter within, and by themselves,\\nand anne had the kindest welcome from each.  henrietta was exactly\\nin that state of recently-improved views, of fresh-formed happiness,\\nwhich made her full of regard and interest for everybody she had\\never liked before at all; and mrs musgrove\\'s real affection had been won\\nby her usefulness when they were in distress.  it was a heartiness,\\nand a warmth, and a sincerity which anne delighted in the more,\\nfrom the sad want of such blessings at home.  she was entreated\\nto give them as much of her time as possible, invited for every day\\nand all day long, or rather claimed as part of the family; and, in return,\\nshe naturally fell into all her wonted ways of attention and assistance,\\nand on charles\\'s leaving them together, was listening to mrs musgrove\\'s\\nhistory of louisa, and to henrietta\\'s of herself, giving opinions\\non business, and recommendations to shops; with intervals of every help\\nwhich mary required, from altering her ribbon to settling her accounts;\\nfrom finding her keys, and assorting her trinkets, to trying\\nto convince her that she was not ill-used by anybody; which mary,\\nwell amused as she generally was, in her station at a window\\noverlooking the entrance to the pump room, could not but have\\nher moments of imagining.\\n\\na morning of thorough confusion was to be expected.  a large party\\nin an hotel ensured a quick-changing, unsettled scene.  one five minutes\\nbrought a note, the next a parcel; and anne had not been there\\nhalf an hour, when their dining-room, spacious as it was,\\nseemed more than half filled:  a party of steady old friends\\nwere seated around mrs musgrove, and charles came back with\\ncaptains harville and wentworth.  the appearance of the latter\\ncould not be more than the surprise of the moment.  it was impossible\\nfor her to have forgotten to feel that this arrival of their\\ncommon friends must be soon bringing them together again.\\ntheir last meeting had been most important in opening his feelings;\\nshe had derived from it a delightful conviction; but she feared\\nfrom his looks, that the same unfortunate persuasion, which had\\nhastened him away from the concert room, still governed.\\nhe did not seem to want to be near enough for conversation.\\n\\nshe tried to be calm, and leave things to take their course,\\nand tried to dwell much on this argument of rational dependence:--\\n\"surely, if there be constant attachment on each side, our hearts\\nmust understand each other ere long.  we are not boy and girl,\\nto be captiously irritable, misled by every moment\\'s inadvertence,\\nand wantonly playing with our own happiness.\"  and yet,\\na few minutes afterwards, she felt as if their being in company\\nwith each other, under their present circumstances, could only be\\nexposing them to inadvertencies and misconstructions of the most\\nmischievous kind.\\n\\n\"anne,\" cried mary, still at her window, \"there is mrs clay,\\ni am sure, standing under the colonnade, and a gentleman with her.\\ni saw them turn the corner from bath street just now.  they seemed\\ndeep in talk.  who is it?  come, and tell me.  good heavens! i recollect.\\nit is mr elliot himself.\"\\n\\n\"no,\" cried anne, quickly, \"it cannot be mr elliot, i assure you.\\nhe was to leave bath at nine this morning, and does not come back\\ntill to-morrow.\"\\n\\nas she spoke, she felt that captain wentworth was looking at her,\\nthe consciousness of which vexed and embarrassed her, and made her regret\\nthat she had said so much, simple as it was.\\n\\nmary, resenting that she should be supposed not to know her own cousin,\\nbegan talking very warmly about the family features, and protesting\\nstill more positively that it was mr elliot, calling again upon anne\\nto come and look for herself, but anne did not mean to stir,\\nand tried to be cool and unconcerned.  her distress returned,\\nhowever, on perceiving smiles and intelligent glances pass between\\ntwo or three of the lady visitors, as if they believed themselves\\nquite in the secret.  it was evident that the report concerning her\\nhad spread, and a short pause succeeded, which seemed to ensure\\nthat it would now spread farther.\\n\\n\"do come, anne\" cried mary, \"come and look yourself.  you will be too late\\nif you do not make haste.  they are parting; they are shaking hands.\\nhe is turning away.  not know mr elliot, indeed!  you seem to have\\nforgot all about lyme.\"\\n\\nto pacify mary, and perhaps screen her own embarrassment,\\nanne did move quietly to the window.  she was just in time to ascertain\\nthat it really was mr elliot, which she had never believed,\\nbefore he disappeared on one side, as mrs clay walked quickly off\\non the other; and checking the surprise which she could not but feel\\nat such an appearance of friendly conference between two persons\\nof totally opposite interest, she calmly said, \"yes, it is mr elliot,\\ncertainly.  he has changed his hour of going, i suppose, that is all,\\nor i may be mistaken, i might not attend;\" and walked back to her chair,\\nrecomposed, and with the comfortable hope of having acquitted herself well.\\n\\nthe visitors took their leave; and charles, having civilly seen them off,\\nand then made a face at them, and abused them for coming, began with--\\n\\n\"well, mother, i have done something for you that you will like.\\ni have been to the theatre, and secured a box for to-morrow night.\\na\\'n\\'t i a good boy?  i know you love a play; and there is room for us all.\\nit holds nine.  i have engaged captain wentworth.  anne will\\nnot be sorry to join us, i am sure.  we all like a play.\\nhave not i done well, mother?\"\\n\\nmrs musgrove was good humouredly beginning to express her perfect readiness\\nfor the play, if henrietta and all the others liked it, when mary\\neagerly interrupted her by exclaiming--\\n\\n\"good heavens, charles! how can you think of such a thing?\\ntake a box for to-morrow night!  have you forgot that we are engaged\\nto camden place to-morrow night? and that we were most particularly asked\\nto meet lady dalrymple and her daughter, and mr elliot, and all\\nthe principal family connexions, on purpose to be introduced to them?\\nhow can you be so forgetful?\"\\n\\n\"phoo! phoo!\" replied charles, \"what\\'s an evening party?\\nnever worth remembering.  your father might have asked us to dinner,\\ni think, if he had wanted to see us.  you may do as you like,\\nbut i shall go to the play.\"\\n\\n\"oh! charles, i declare it will be too abominable if you do,\\nwhen you promised to go.\"\\n\\n\"no, i did not promise.  i only smirked and bowed, and said the word\\n`happy.\\'  there was no promise.\"\\n\\n\"but you must go, charles.  it would be unpardonable to fail.\\nwe were asked on purpose to be introduced.  there was always\\nsuch a great connexion between the dalrymples and ourselves.\\nnothing ever happened on either side that was not announced immediately.\\nwe are quite near relations, you know; and mr elliot too,\\nwhom you ought so particularly to be acquainted with!  every attention\\nis due to mr elliot.  consider, my father\\'s heir:  the future\\nrepresentative of the family.\"\\n\\n\"don\\'t talk to me about heirs and representatives,\" cried charles.\\n\"i am not one of those who neglect the reigning power to bow\\nto the rising sun.  if i would not go for the sake of your father,\\ni should think it scandalous to go for the sake of his heir.\\nwhat is mr elliot to me?\"  the careless expression was life to anne,\\nwho saw that captain wentworth was all attention, looking and\\nlistening with his whole soul; and that the last words brought\\nhis enquiring eyes from charles to herself.\\n\\ncharles and mary still talked on in the same style; he, half serious\\nand half jesting, maintaining the scheme for the play, and she,\\ninvariably serious, most warmly opposing it, and not omitting\\nto make it known that, however determined to go to camden place herself,\\nshe should not think herself very well used, if they went to the play\\nwithout her.  mrs musgrove interposed.\\n\\n\"we had better put it off.  charles, you had much better go back\\nand change the box for tuesday.  it would be a pity to be divided,\\nand we should be losing miss anne, too, if there is a party at her father\\'s;\\nand i am sure neither henrietta nor i should care at all for the play,\\nif miss anne could not be with us.\"\\n\\nanne felt truly obliged to her for such kindness; and quite as much\\nso for the opportunity it gave her of decidedly saying--\\n\\n\"if it depended only on my inclination, ma\\'am, the party at home\\n(excepting on mary\\'s account) would not be the smallest impediment.\\ni have no pleasure in the sort of meeting, and should be too happy\\nto change it for a play, and with you.  but, it had better\\nnot be attempted, perhaps.\"  she had spoken it; but she trembled\\nwhen it was done, conscious that her words were listened to,\\nand daring not even to try to observe their effect.\\n\\nit was soon generally agreed that tuesday should be the day;\\ncharles only reserving the advantage of still teasing his wife,\\nby persisting that he would go to the play to-morrow if nobody else would.\\n\\ncaptain wentworth left his seat, and walked to the fire-place;\\nprobably for the sake of walking away from it soon afterwards,\\nand taking a station, with less bare-faced design, by anne.\\n\\n\"you have not been long enough in bath,\" said he, \"to enjoy\\nthe evening parties of the place.\"\\n\\n\"oh! no.  the usual character of them has nothing for me.\\ni am no card-player.\"\\n\\n\"you were not formerly, i know.  you did not use to like cards;\\nbut time makes many changes.\"\\n\\n\"i am not yet so much changed,\" cried anne, and stopped, fearing she\\nhardly knew what misconstruction.  after waiting a few moments\\nhe said, and as if it were the result of immediate feeling,\\n\"it is a period, indeed!  eight years and a half is a period.\"\\n\\nwhether he would have proceeded farther was left to anne\\'s imagination\\nto ponder over in a calmer hour; for while still hearing the sounds\\nhe had uttered, she was startled to other subjects by henrietta,\\neager to make use of the present leisure for getting out,\\nand calling on her companions to lose no time, lest somebody else\\nshould come in.\\n\\nthey were obliged to move.  anne talked of being perfectly ready,\\nand tried to look it; but she felt that could henrietta have known\\nthe regret and reluctance of her heart in quitting that chair,\\nin preparing to quit the room, she would have found, in all her own\\nsensations for her cousin, in the very security of his affection,\\nwherewith to pity her.\\n\\ntheir preparations, however, were stopped short.  alarming sounds\\nwere heard; other visitors approached, and the door was thrown open\\nfor sir walter and miss elliot, whose entrance seemed to give\\na general chill.  anne felt an instant oppression, and wherever she looked\\nsaw symptoms of the same.  the comfort, the freedom, the gaiety\\nof the room was over, hushed into cold composure, determined silence,\\nor insipid talk, to meet the heartless elegance of her father and sister.\\nhow mortifying to feel that it was so!\\n\\nher jealous eye was satisfied in one particular.  captain wentworth\\nwas acknowledged again by each, by elizabeth more graciously than before.\\nshe even addressed him once, and looked at him more than once.\\nelizabeth was, in fact, revolving a great measure.  the sequel\\nexplained it.  after the waste of a few minutes in saying\\nthe proper nothings, she began to give the invitation which\\nwas to comprise all the remaining dues of the musgroves.\\n\"to-morrow evening, to meet a few friends:  no formal party.\"\\nit was all said very gracefully, and the cards with which she had\\nprovided herself, the \"miss elliot at home,\" were laid on the table,\\nwith a courteous, comprehensive smile to all, and one smile and\\none card more decidedly for captain wentworth.  the truth was,\\nthat elizabeth had been long enough in bath to understand\\nthe importance of a man of such an air and appearance as his.\\nthe past was nothing.  the present was that captain wentworth\\nwould move about well in her drawing-room.  the card was pointedly given,\\nand sir walter and elizabeth arose and disappeared.\\n\\nthe interruption had been short, though severe, and ease and animation\\nreturned to most of those they left as the door shut them out,\\nbut not to anne.  she could think only of the invitation she had\\nwith such astonishment witnessed, and of the manner in which\\nit had been received; a manner of doubtful meaning, of surprise rather\\nthan gratification, of polite acknowledgement rather than acceptance.\\nshe knew him; she saw disdain in his eye, and could not venture to believe\\nthat he had determined to accept such an offering, as an atonement\\nfor all the insolence of the past.  her spirits sank.  he held the card\\nin his hand after they were gone, as if deeply considering it.\\n\\n\"only think of elizabeth\\'s including everybody!\" whispered mary\\nvery audibly.  \"i do not wonder captain wentworth is delighted!\\nyou see he cannot put the card out of his hand.\"\\n\\nanne caught his eye, saw his cheeks glow, and his mouth form itself\\ninto a momentary expression of contempt, and turned away,\\nthat she might neither see nor hear more to vex her.\\n\\nthe party separated.  the gentlemen had their own pursuits,\\nthe ladies proceeded on their own business, and they met no more while\\nanne belonged to them.  she was earnestly begged to return and dine,\\nand give them all the rest of the day, but her spirits had been\\nso long exerted that at present she felt unequal to more,\\nand fit only for home, where she might be sure of being as silent\\nas she chose.\\n\\npromising to be with them the whole of the following morning, therefore,\\nshe closed the fatigues of the present by a toilsome walk to camden place,\\nthere to spend the evening chiefly in listening to the busy arrangements\\nof elizabeth and mrs clay for the morrow\\'s party, the frequent enumeration\\nof the persons invited, and the continually improving detail of all\\nthe embellishments which were to make it the most completely elegant\\nof its kind in bath, while harassing herself with the never-ending\\nquestion, of whether captain wentworth would come or not?  they were\\nreckoning him as certain, but with her it was a gnawing solicitude\\nnever appeased for five minutes together.  she generally thought\\nhe would come, because she generally thought he ought; but it was a case\\nwhich she could not so shape into any positive act of duty or discretion,\\nas inevitably to defy the suggestions of very opposite feelings.\\n\\nshe only roused herself from the broodings of this restless agitation,\\nto let mrs clay know that she had been seen with mr elliot\\nthree hours after his being supposed to be out of bath,\\nfor having watched in vain for some intimation of the interview\\nfrom the lady herself, she determined to mention it, and it seemed to her\\nthere was guilt in mrs clay\\'s face as she listened.  it was transient:\\ncleared away in an instant; but anne could imagine she read there\\nthe consciousness of having, by some complication of mutual trick,\\nor some overbearing authority of his, been obliged to attend\\n(perhaps for half an hour) to his lectures and restrictions on her designs\\non sir walter.  she exclaimed, however, with a very tolerable\\nimitation of nature: --\\n\\n\"oh! dear! very true.  only think, miss elliot, to my great surprise\\ni met with mr elliot in bath street.  i was never more astonished.\\nhe turned back and walked with me to the pump yard.  he had been prevented\\nsetting off for thornberry, but i really forget by what;\\nfor i was in a hurry, and could not much attend, and i can only answer\\nfor his being determined not to be delayed in his return.\\nhe wanted to know how early he might be admitted to-morrow.\\nhe was full of `to-morrow,\\' and it is very evident that i have been\\nfull of it too, ever since i entered the house, and learnt the extension\\nof your plan and all that had happened, or my seeing him could never have\\ngone so entirely out of my head.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 23\\n\\n\\none day only had passed since anne\\'s conversation with mrs smith;\\nbut a keener interest had succeeded, and she was now so little touched\\nby mr elliot\\'s conduct, except by its effects in one quarter,\\nthat it became a matter of course the next morning, still to defer\\nher explanatory visit in rivers street.  she had promised to be\\nwith the musgroves from breakfast to dinner.  her faith was plighted,\\nand mr elliot\\'s character, like the sultaness scheherazade\\'s head,\\nmust live another day.\\n\\nshe could not keep her appointment punctually, however;\\nthe weather was unfavourable, and she had grieved over the rain\\non her friends\\' account, and felt it very much on her own,\\nbefore she was able to attempt the walk.  when she reached the white hart,\\nand made her way to the proper apartment, she found herself\\nneither arriving quite in time, nor the first to arrive.\\nthe party before her were, mrs musgrove, talking to mrs croft,\\nand captain harville to captain wentworth; and she immediately heard\\nthat mary and henrietta, too impatient to wait, had gone out the moment\\nit had cleared, but would be back again soon, and that the strictest\\ninjunctions had been left with mrs musgrove to keep her there\\ntill they returned.  she had only to submit, sit down,\\nbe outwardly composed, and feel herself plunged at once\\nin all the agitations which she had merely laid her account of\\ntasting a little before the morning closed.  there was no delay,\\nno waste of time.  she was deep in the happiness of such misery,\\nor the misery of such happiness, instantly.  two minutes after\\nher entering the room, captain wentworth said--\\n\\n\"we will write the letter we were talking of, harville, now,\\nif you will give me materials.\"\\n\\nmaterials were at hand, on a separate table; he went to it,\\nand nearly turning his back to them all, was engrossed by writing.\\n\\nmrs musgrove was giving mrs croft the history of her eldest\\ndaughter\\'s engagement, and just in that inconvenient tone of voice\\nwhich was perfectly audible while it pretended to be a whisper.\\nanne felt that she did not belong to the conversation, and yet,\\nas captain harville seemed thoughtful and not disposed to talk,\\nshe could not avoid hearing many undesirable particulars; such as,\\n\"how mr musgrove and my brother hayter had met again and again\\nto talk it over; what my brother hayter had said one day,\\nand what mr musgrove had proposed the next, and what had occurred\\nto my sister hayter, and what the young people had wished, and what\\ni said at first i never could consent to, but was afterwards persuaded\\nto think might do very well,\" and a great deal in the same style\\nof open-hearted communication:  minutiae which, even with every advantage\\nof taste and delicacy, which good mrs musgrove could not give,\\ncould be properly interesting only to the principals.  mrs croft\\nwas attending with great good-humour, and whenever she spoke at all,\\nit was very sensibly.  anne hoped the gentlemen might each be\\ntoo much self-occupied to hear.\\n\\n\"and so, ma\\'am, all these thing considered,\" said mrs musgrove,\\nin her powerful whisper, \"though we could have wished it different,\\nyet, altogether, we did not think it fair to stand out any longer,\\nfor charles hayter was quite wild about it, and henrietta was\\npretty near as bad; and so we thought they had better marry at once,\\nand make the best of it, as many others have done before them.\\nat any rate, said i, it will be better than a long engagement.\"\\n\\n\"that is precisely what i was going to observe,\" cried mrs croft.\\n\"i would rather have young people settle on a small income at once,\\nand have to struggle with a few difficulties together, than be\\ninvolved in a long engagement.  i always think that no mutual--\"\\n\\n\"oh! dear mrs croft,\" cried mrs musgrove, unable to let her\\nfinish her speech, \"there is nothing i so abominate for young people\\nas a long engagement.  it is what i always protested against\\nfor my children.  it is all very well, i used to say, for young people\\nto be engaged, if there is a certainty of their being able to marry\\nin six months, or even in twelve; but a long engagement--\"\\n\\n\"yes, dear ma\\'am,\" said mrs croft, \"or an uncertain engagement,\\nan engagement which may be long.  to begin without knowing\\nthat at such a time there will be the means of marrying,\\ni hold to be very unsafe and unwise, and what i think all parents\\nshould prevent as far as they can.\"\\n\\nanne found an unexpected interest here.  she felt its application\\nto herself, felt it in a nervous thrill all over her; and at the same\\nmoment that her eyes instinctively glanced towards the distant table,\\ncaptain wentworth\\'s pen ceased to move, his head was raised, pausing,\\nlistening, and he turned round the next instant to give a look,\\none quick, conscious look at her.\\n\\nthe two ladies continued to talk, to re-urge the same admitted truths,\\nand enforce them with such examples of the ill effect of\\na contrary practice as had fallen within their observation,\\nbut anne heard nothing distinctly; it was only a buzz of words in her ear,\\nher mind was in confusion.\\n\\ncaptain harville, who had in truth been hearing none of it,\\nnow left his seat, and moved to a window, and anne seeming to watch him,\\nthough it was from thorough absence of mind, became gradually sensible\\nthat he was inviting her to join him where he stood.  he looked at her\\nwith a smile, and a little motion of the head, which expressed,\\n\"come to me, i have something to say;\" and the unaffected,\\neasy kindness of manner which denoted the feelings of an older acquaintance\\nthan he really was, strongly enforced the invitation.  she roused herself\\nand went to him.  the window at which he stood was at the other end\\nof the room from where the two ladies were sitting, and though nearer\\nto captain wentworth\\'s table, not very near.  as she joined him,\\ncaptain harville\\'s countenance re-assumed the serious, thoughtful\\nexpression which seemed its natural character.\\n\\n\"look here,\" said he, unfolding a parcel in his hand, and displaying\\na small miniature painting, \"do you know who that is?\"\\n\\n\"certainly:  captain benwick.\"\\n\\n\"yes, and you may guess who it is for.  but,\" (in a deep tone,)\\n\"it was not done for her.  miss elliot, do you remember our\\nwalking together at lyme, and grieving for him?  i little thought then--\\nbut no matter.  this was drawn at the cape.  he met with\\na clever young german artist at the cape, and in compliance with a promise\\nto my poor sister, sat to him, and was bringing it home for her;\\nand i have now the charge of getting it properly set for another!\\nit was a commission to me!  but who else was there to employ?\\ni hope i can allow for him.  i am not sorry, indeed, to make it\\nover to another.  he undertakes it;\" (looking towards captain wentworth,)\\n\"he is writing about it now.\"  and with a quivering lip he wound up\\nthe whole by adding, \"poor fanny! she would not have forgotten him so soon!\"\\n\\n\"no,\" replied anne, in a low, feeling voice. \"that i can easily believe.\"\\n\\n\"it was not in her nature.  she doted on him.\"\\n\\n\"it would not be the nature of any woman who truly loved.\"\\n\\ncaptain harville smiled, as much as to say, \"do you claim that\\nfor your sex?\" and she answered the question, smiling also,\\n\"yes.  we certainly do not forget you as soon as you forget us.\\nit is, perhaps, our fate rather than our merit.  we cannot help ourselves.\\nwe live at home, quiet, confined, and our feelings prey upon us.\\nyou are forced on exertion.  you have always a profession, pursuits,\\nbusiness of some sort or other, to take you back into the world immediately,\\nand continual occupation and change soon weaken impressions.\"\\n\\n\"granting your assertion that the world does all this so soon for men\\n(which, however, i do not think i shall grant), it does not apply\\nto benwick.  he has not been forced upon any exertion.  the peace\\nturned him on shore at the very moment, and he has been living with us,\\nin our little family circle, ever since.\"\\n\\n\"true,\" said anne, \"very true; i did not recollect; but what shall\\nwe say now, captain harville?  if the change be not from\\noutward circumstances, it must be from within; it must be nature,\\nman\\'s nature, which has done the business for captain benwick.\"\\n\\n\"no, no, it is not man\\'s nature.  i will not allow it to be more\\nman\\'s nature than woman\\'s to be inconstant and forget those they do love,\\nor have loved.  i believe the reverse.  i believe in a true analogy\\nbetween our bodily frames and our mental; and that as our bodies are\\nthe strongest, so are our feelings; capable of bearing most rough usage,\\nand riding out the heaviest weather.\"\\n\\n\"your feelings may be the strongest,\" replied anne, \"but the same spirit\\nof analogy will authorise me to assert that ours are the most tender.\\nman is more robust than woman, but he is not longer lived;\\nwhich exactly explains my view of the nature of their attachments.\\nnay, it would be too hard upon you, if it were otherwise.\\nyou have difficulties, and privations, and dangers enough to struggle with.\\nyou are always labouring and toiling, exposed to every risk and hardship.\\nyour home, country, friends, all quitted.  neither time, nor health,\\nnor life, to be called your own.  it would be hard, indeed\"\\n(with a faltering voice), \"if woman\\'s feelings were to be\\nadded to all this.\"\\n\\n\"we shall never agree upon this question,\" captain harville\\nwas beginning to say, when a slight noise called their attention\\nto captain wentworth\\'s hitherto perfectly quiet division of the room.\\nit was nothing more than that his pen had fallen down; but anne was\\nstartled at finding him nearer than she had supposed, and half inclined\\nto suspect that the pen had only fallen because he had been\\noccupied by them, striving to catch sounds, which yet she did not think\\nhe could have caught.\\n\\n\"have you finished your letter?\" said captain harville.\\n\\n\"not quite, a few lines more.  i shall have done in five minutes.\"\\n\\n\"there is no hurry on my side.  i am only ready whenever you are.\\ni am in very good anchorage here,\" (smiling at anne,) \"well supplied,\\nand want for nothing.  no hurry for a signal at all.  well, miss elliot,\"\\n(lowering his voice,) \"as i was saying we shall never agree,\\ni suppose, upon this point.  no man and woman, would, probably.\\nbut let me observe that all histories are against you--all stories,\\nprose and verse.  if i had such a memory as benwick, i could bring you\\nfifty quotations in a moment on my side the argument, and i do not think\\ni ever opened a book in my life which had not something to say\\nupon woman\\'s inconstancy.  songs and proverbs, all talk\\nof woman\\'s fickleness.  but perhaps you will say, these were all\\nwritten by men.\"\\n\\n\"perhaps i shall.  yes, yes, if you please, no reference to examples\\nin books.  men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story.\\neducation has been theirs in so much higher a degree; the pen has\\nbeen in their hands.  i will not allow books to prove anything.\"\\n\\n\"but how shall we prove anything?\"\\n\\n\"we never shall.  we never can expect to prove any thing upon such a point.\\nit is a difference of opinion which does not admit of proof.\\nwe each begin, probably, with a little bias towards our own sex;\\nand upon that bias build every circumstance in favour of it\\nwhich has occurred within our own circle; many of which circumstances\\n(perhaps those very cases which strike us the most) may be precisely such\\nas cannot be brought forward without betraying a confidence,\\nor in some respect saying what should not be said.\"\\n\\n\"ah!\" cried captain harville, in a tone of strong feeling,\\n\"if i could but make you comprehend what a man suffers when he takes\\na last look at his wife and children, and watches the boat\\nthat he has sent them off in, as long as it is in sight,\\nand then turns away and says, `god knows whether we ever meet again!\\'\\nand then, if i could convey to you the glow of his soul when he does\\nsee them again; when, coming back after a twelvemonth\\'s absence,\\nperhaps, and obliged to put into another port, he calculates how soon\\nit be possible to get them there, pretending to deceive himself,\\nand saying, `they cannot be here till such a day,\\' but all the while\\nhoping for them twelve hours sooner, and seeing them arrive at last,\\nas if heaven had given them wings, by many hours sooner still!\\nif i could explain to you all this, and all that a man can bear and do,\\nand glories to do, for the sake of these treasures of his existence!\\ni speak, you know, only of such men as have hearts!\" pressing his own\\nwith emotion.\\n\\n\"oh!\" cried anne eagerly, \"i hope i do justice to all that is felt by you,\\nand by those who resemble you.  god forbid that i should undervalue\\nthe warm and faithful feelings of any of my fellow-creatures!\\ni should deserve utter contempt if i dared to suppose that true attachment\\nand constancy were known only by woman.  no, i believe you capable\\nof everything great and good in your married lives.  i believe you equal\\nto every important exertion, and to every domestic forbearance,\\nso long as--if i may be allowed the expression--so long as you have\\nan object.  i mean while the woman you love lives, and lives for you.\\nall the privilege i claim for my own sex (it is not a very enviable one;\\nyou need not covet it), is that of loving longest, when existence\\nor when hope is gone.\"\\n\\nshe could not immediately have uttered another sentence; her heart\\nwas too full, her breath too much oppressed.\\n\\n\"you are a good soul,\" cried captain harville, putting his hand\\non her arm, quite affectionately.  \"there is no quarrelling with you.\\nand when i think of benwick, my tongue is tied.\"\\n\\ntheir attention was called towards the others.  mrs croft was taking leave.\\n\\n\"here, frederick, you and i part company, i believe,\" said she.\\n\"i am going home, and you have an engagement with your friend.\\nto-night we may have the pleasure of all meeting again at your party,\"\\n(turning to anne.)  \"we had your sister\\'s card yesterday,\\nand i understood frederick had a card too, though i did not see it;\\nand you are disengaged, frederick, are you not, as well as ourselves?\"\\n\\ncaptain wentworth was folding up a letter in great haste, and either\\ncould not or would not answer fully.\\n\\n\"yes,\" said he, \"very true; here we separate, but harville and i\\nshall soon be after you; that is, harville, if you are ready,\\ni am in half a minute.  i know you will not be sorry to be off.\\ni shall be at your service in half a minute.\"\\n\\nmrs croft left them, and captain wentworth, having sealed his letter\\nwith great rapidity, was indeed ready, and had even a hurried,\\nagitated air, which shewed impatience to be gone.  anne knew not how\\nto understand it.  she had the kindest \"good morning, god bless you!\"\\nfrom captain harville, but from him not a word, nor a look!\\nhe had passed out of the room without a look!\\n\\nshe had only time, however, to move closer to the table where\\nhe had been writing, when footsteps were heard returning;\\nthe door opened, it was himself.  he begged their pardon,\\nbut he had forgotten his gloves, and instantly crossing the room\\nto the writing table, he drew out a letter from under the scattered paper,\\nplaced it before anne with eyes of glowing entreaty fixed on her\\nfor a time, and hastily collecting his gloves, was again out of the room,\\nalmost before mrs musgrove was aware of his being in it:\\nthe work of an instant!\\n\\nthe revolution which one instant had made in anne, was almost\\nbeyond expression.  the letter, with a direction hardly legible,\\nto \"miss a. e.--,\" was evidently the one which he had been folding\\nso hastily.  while supposed to be writing only to captain benwick,\\nhe had been also addressing her!  on the contents of that letter\\ndepended all which this world could do for her.  anything was possible,\\nanything might be defied rather than suspense.  mrs musgrove had\\nlittle arrangements of her own at her own table; to their protection\\nshe must trust, and sinking into the chair which he had occupied,\\nsucceeding to the very spot where he had leaned and written,\\nher eyes devoured the following words:\\n\\n\\n\"i can listen no longer in silence.  i must speak to you by such means\\nas are within my reach.  you pierce my soul.  i am half agony,\\nhalf hope.  tell me not that i am too late, that such precious feelings\\nare gone for ever.  i offer myself to you again with a heart\\neven more your own than when you almost broke it, eight years\\nand a half ago.  dare not say that man forgets sooner than  woman,\\nthat his love has an earlier death.  i have loved none but you.\\nunjust i may have been, weak and resentful i have been,\\nbut never inconstant.  you alone have brought me to bath.\\nfor you alone, i think and plan.  have you not seen this?\\ncan you fail to have understood my wishes?  i had not waited even\\nthese ten days, could i have read your feelings, as i think you must have\\npenetrated mine.  i can hardly write.  i am every instant hearing\\nsomething which overpowers me.  you sink your voice, but i can\\ndistinguish the tones of that voice when they would be lost on others.\\ntoo good, too excellent creature!  you do us justice, indeed.\\nyou do believe that there is true attachment and constancy among men.\\nbelieve it to be most fervent, most undeviating, in f. w.\\n\\n\"i must go, uncertain of my fate; but i shall return hither,\\nor follow your party, as soon as possible.  a word, a look,\\nwill be enough to decide whether i enter your father\\'s house\\nthis evening or never.\"\\n\\n\\nsuch a letter was not to be soon recovered from.  half and hour\\'s solitude\\nand reflection might have tranquillized her; but the ten minutes only\\nwhich now passed before she was interrupted, with all the restraints\\nof her situation, could do nothing towards tranquillity.  every moment\\nrather brought fresh agitation.  it was overpowering happiness.\\nand before she was beyond the first stage of full sensation,\\ncharles, mary, and henrietta all came in.\\n\\nthe absolute necessity of seeming like herself produced then\\nan immediate struggle; but after a while she could do no more.\\nshe began not to understand a word they said, and was obliged\\nto plead indisposition and excuse herself.  they could then see\\nthat she looked very ill, were shocked and concerned, and would not\\nstir without her for the world.  this was dreadful.  would they only\\nhave gone away, and left her in the quiet possession of that room\\nit would have been her cure; but to have them all standing or\\nwaiting around her was distracting, and in desperation,\\nshe said she would go home.\\n\\n\"by all means, my dear,\" cried mrs musgrove, \"go home directly,\\nand take care of yourself, that you may be fit for the evening.\\ni wish sarah was here to doctor you, but i am no doctor myself.\\ncharles, ring and order a chair.  she must not walk.\"\\n\\nbut the chair would never do.  worse than all!  to lose the possibility\\nof speaking two words to captain wentworth in the course of her quiet,\\nsolitary progress up the town (and she felt almost certain of meeting him)\\ncould not be borne.  the chair was earnestly protested against,\\nand mrs musgrove, who thought only of one sort of illness,\\nhaving assured herself with some anxiety, that there had been no fall\\nin the case; that anne had not at any time lately slipped down,\\nand got a blow on her head; that she was perfectly convinced of having\\nhad no fall; could part with her cheerfully, and depend on\\nfinding her better at night.\\n\\nanxious to omit no possible precaution, anne struggled, and said--\\n\\n\"i am afraid, ma\\'am, that it is not perfectly understood.\\npray be so good as to mention to the other gentlemen that we hope\\nto see your whole party this evening.  i am afraid there had been\\nsome mistake; and i wish you particularly to assure captain harville\\nand captain wentworth, that we hope to see them both.\"\\n\\n\"oh! my dear, it is quite understood, i give you my word.\\ncaptain harville has no thought but of going.\"\\n\\n\"do you think so?  but i am afraid; and i should be so very sorry.\\nwill you promise me to mention it, when you see them again?\\nyou will see them both this morning, i dare say.  do promise me.\"\\n\\n\"to be sure i will, if you wish it.  charles, if you see captain harville\\nanywhere, remember to give miss anne\\'s message.  but indeed, my dear,\\nyou need not be uneasy.  captain harville holds himself quite engaged,\\ni\\'ll answer for it; and captain wentworth the same, i dare say.\"\\n\\nanne could do no more; but her heart prophesied some mischance\\nto damp the perfection of her felicity.  it could not be very lasting,\\nhowever.  even if he did not come to camden place himself,\\nit would be in her power to send an intelligible sentence\\nby captain harville.  another momentary vexation occurred.\\ncharles, in his real concern and good nature, would go home with her;\\nthere was no preventing him.  this was almost cruel.  but she could not\\nbe long ungrateful; he was sacrificing an engagement at a gunsmith\\'s,\\nto be of use to her; and she set off with him, with no feeling\\nbut gratitude apparent.\\n\\nthey were on union street, when a quicker step behind, a something\\nof familiar sound, gave her two moments\\' preparation for the sight\\nof captain wentworth.  he joined them; but, as if irresolute\\nwhether to join or to pass on, said nothing, only looked.\\nanne could command herself enough to receive that look,\\nand not repulsively.  the cheeks which had been pale now glowed,\\nand the movements which had hesitated were decided.  he walked by her side.\\npresently, struck by a sudden thought, charles said--\\n\\n\"captain wentworth, which way are you going?  only to gay street,\\nor farther up the town?\"\\n\\n\"i hardly know,\" replied captain wentworth, surprised.\\n\\n\"are you going as high as belmont?  are you going near camden place?\\nbecause, if you are, i shall have no scruple in asking you\\nto take my place, and give anne your arm to her father\\'s door.\\nshe is rather done for this morning, and must not go so far without help,\\nand i ought to be at that fellow\\'s in the market place.\\nhe promised me the sight of a capital gun he is just going to send off;\\nsaid he would keep it unpacked to the last possible moment,\\nthat i might see it; and if i do not turn back now, i have no chance.\\nby his description, a good deal like the second size double-barrel of mine,\\nwhich you shot with one day round winthrop.\"\\n\\nthere could not be an objection.  there could be only the most\\nproper alacrity, a most obliging compliance for public view;\\nand smiles reined in and spirits dancing in private rapture.\\nin half a minute charles was at the bottom of union street again,\\nand the other two proceeding together:  and soon words enough had passed\\nbetween them to decide their direction towards the comparatively quiet\\nand retired gravel walk, where the power of conversation would make\\nthe present hour a blessing indeed, and prepare it for all\\nthe immortality which the happiest recollections of their own future lives\\ncould bestow.  there they exchanged again those feelings\\nand those promises which had once before seemed to secure everything,\\nbut which had been followed by so many, many years of division\\nand estrangement.  there they returned again into the past,\\nmore exquisitely happy, perhaps, in their re-union, than when\\nit had been first projected; more tender, more tried, more fixed\\nin a knowledge of each other\\'s character, truth, and attachment;\\nmore equal to act, more justified in acting.  and there, as they slowly\\npaced the gradual ascent, heedless of every group around them,\\nseeing neither sauntering politicians, bustling housekeepers,\\nflirting girls, nor nursery-maids and children, they could indulge in\\nthose retrospections and acknowledgements, and especially in\\nthose explanations of what had directly preceded the present moment,\\nwhich were so poignant and so ceaseless in interest.  all the little\\nvariations of the last week were gone through; and of yesterday\\nand today there could scarcely be an end.\\n\\nshe had not mistaken him.  jealousy of mr elliot had been\\nthe retarding weight, the doubt, the torment.  that had begun to operate\\nin the very hour of first meeting her in bath; that had returned,\\nafter a short suspension, to ruin the concert; and that had influenced him\\nin everything he had said and done, or omitted to say and do,\\nin the last four-and-twenty hours.  it had been gradually yielding\\nto the better hopes which her looks, or words, or actions\\noccasionally encouraged; it had been vanquished at last by\\nthose sentiments and those tones which had reached him while she talked\\nwith captain harville; and under the irresistible governance of which\\nhe had seized a sheet of paper, and poured out his feelings.\\n\\nof what he had then written, nothing was to be retracted or qualified.\\nhe persisted in having loved none but her.  she had never been supplanted.\\nhe never even believed himself to see her equal.  thus much indeed\\nhe was obliged to acknowledge:  that he had been constant unconsciously,\\nnay unintentionally; that he had meant to forget her, and believed it\\nto be done.  he had imagined himself indifferent, when he had only\\nbeen angry; and he had been unjust to her merits, because he had been\\na sufferer from them.  her character was now fixed on his mind\\nas perfection itself, maintaining the loveliest medium of fortitude\\nand gentleness; but he was obliged to acknowledge that only at uppercross\\nhad he learnt to do her justice, and only at lyme had he begun\\nto understand himself.  at lyme, he had received lessons\\nof more than one sort.  the passing admiration of mr elliot\\nhad at least roused him, and the scenes on the cobb and at\\ncaptain harville\\'s had fixed her superiority.\\n\\nin his preceding attempts to attach himself to louisa musgrove\\n(the attempts of angry pride), he protested that he had for ever\\nfelt it to be impossible; that he had not cared, could not care,\\nfor louisa; though till that day, till the leisure for reflection\\nwhich followed it, he had not understood the perfect excellence\\nof the mind with which louisa\\'s could so ill bear a comparison,\\nor the perfect unrivalled hold it possessed over his own.\\nthere, he had learnt to distinguish between the steadiness of principle\\nand the obstinacy of self-will, between the darings of heedlessness\\nand the resolution of a collected mind.  there he had seen everything\\nto exalt in his estimation the woman he had lost; and there begun\\nto deplore the pride, the folly, the madness of resentment,\\nwhich had kept him from trying to regain her when thrown in his way.\\n\\nfrom that period his penance had become severe.  he had no sooner\\nbeen free from the horror and remorse attending the first few days\\nof louisa\\'s accident, no sooner begun to feel himself alive again,\\nthan he had begun to feel himself, though alive, not at liberty.\\n\\n\"i found,\" said he, \"that i was considered by harville an engaged man!\\nthat neither harville nor his wife entertained a doubt of our\\nmutual attachment.  i was startled and shocked.  to a degree,\\ni could contradict this instantly; but, when i began to reflect\\nthat others might have felt the same--her own family, nay,\\nperhaps herself--i was no longer at my own disposal.  i was hers in honour\\nif she wished it.  i had been unguarded.  i had not thought seriously\\non this subject before.  i had not considered that my excessive intimacy\\nmust have its danger of ill consequence in many ways; and that i had\\nno right to be trying whether i could attach myself to either of the girls,\\nat the risk of raising even an unpleasant report, were there no other\\nill effects.  i had been grossly wrong, and must abide the consequences.\"\\n\\nhe found too late, in short, that he had entangled himself;\\nand that precisely as he became fully satisfied of his not caring\\nfor louisa at all, he must regard himself as bound to her,\\nif her sentiments for him were what the harvilles supposed.\\nit determined him to leave lyme, and await her complete recovery elsewhere.\\nhe would gladly weaken, by any fair means, whatever feelings or\\nspeculations concerning him might exist; and he went, therefore,\\nto his brother\\'s, meaning after a while to return to kellynch,\\nand act as circumstances might require.\\n\\n\"i was six weeks with edward,\" said he, \"and saw him happy.\\ni could have no other pleasure.  i deserved none.  he enquired after you\\nvery particularly; asked even if you were personally altered,\\nlittle suspecting that to my eye you could never alter.\"\\n\\nanne smiled, and let it pass.  it was too pleasing a blunder\\nfor a reproach.  it is something for a woman to be assured,\\nin her eight-and-twentieth year, that she has not lost one charm\\nof earlier youth; but the value of such homage was inexpressibly increased\\nto anne, by comparing it with former words, and feeling it to be\\nthe result, not the cause of a revival of his warm attachment.\\n\\nhe had remained in shropshire, lamenting the blindness of his own pride,\\nand the blunders of his own calculations, till at once released from louisa\\nby the astonishing and felicitous intelligence of her engagement\\nwith benwick.\\n\\n\"here,\" said he, \"ended the worst of my state; for now i could at least\\nput myself in the way of happiness; i could exert myself;\\ni could do something.  but to be waiting so long in inaction,\\nand waiting only for evil, had been dreadful.  within the first\\nfive minutes i said, `i will be at bath on wednesday,\\' and i was.\\nwas it unpardonable to think it worth my while to come? and to arrive\\nwith some degree of hope?  you were single.  it was possible that\\nyou might retain the feelings of the past, as i did; and one encouragement\\nhappened to be mine.  i could never doubt that you would be loved and\\nsought by others, but i knew to a certainty that you had refused one man,\\nat least, of better pretensions than myself; and i could not help\\noften saying, `was this for me?\\'\"\\n\\ntheir first meeting in milsom street afforded much to be said,\\nbut the concert still more.  that evening seemed to be made up\\nof exquisite moments.  the moment of her stepping forward\\nin the octagon room to speak to him:  the moment of mr elliot\\'s appearing\\nand tearing her away, and one or two subsequent moments,\\nmarked by returning hope or increasing despondency, were dwelt on\\nwith energy.\\n\\n\"to see you,\" cried he, \"in the midst of those who could not be\\nmy well-wishers; to see your cousin close by you, conversing and smiling,\\nand feel all the horrible eligibilities and proprieties of the match!\\nto consider it as the certain wish of every being who could hope\\nto influence you!  even if your own feelings were reluctant or indifferent,\\nto consider what powerful supports would be his!  was it not enough\\nto make the fool of me which i appeared?  how could i look on\\nwithout agony?  was not the very sight of the friend who sat behind you,\\nwas not the recollection of what had been, the knowledge of her influence,\\nthe indelible, immoveable impression of what persuasion had once done--\\nwas it not all against me?\"\\n\\n\"you should have distinguished,\" replied anne.  \"you should not have\\nsuspected me now; the case is so different, and my age is so different.\\nif i was wrong in yielding to persuasion once, remember that\\nit was to persuasion exerted on the side of safety, not of risk.\\nwhen i yielded, i thought it was to duty, but no duty could be called\\nin aid here.  in marrying a man indifferent to me, all risk\\nwould have been incurred, and all duty violated.\"\\n\\n\"perhaps i ought to have reasoned thus,\" he replied, \"but i could not.\\ni could not derive benefit from the late knowledge i had acquired\\nof your character.  i could not bring it into play; it was overwhelmed,\\nburied, lost in those earlier feelings which i had been smarting under\\nyear after year.  i could think of you only as one who had yielded,\\nwho had given me up, who had been influenced by any one rather than by me.\\ni saw you with the very person who had guided you in that year of misery.\\ni had no reason to believe her of less authority now.  the force of habit\\nwas to be added.\"\\n\\n\"i should have thought,\" said anne, \"that my manner to yourself\\nmight have spared you much or all of this.\"\\n\\n\"no, no! your manner might be only the ease which your engagement\\nto another man would give.  i left you in this belief; and yet,\\ni was determined to see you again.  my spirits rallied with the morning,\\nand i felt that i had still a motive for remaining here.\"\\n\\nat last anne was at home again, and happier than any one in that house\\ncould have conceived.  all the surprise and suspense, and every other\\npainful part of the morning dissipated by this conversation,\\nshe re-entered the house so happy as to be obliged to find an alloy\\nin some momentary apprehensions of its being impossible to last.\\nan interval of meditation, serious and grateful, was the best corrective\\nof everything dangerous in such high-wrought felicity; and she went\\nto her room, and grew steadfast and fearless in the thankfulness\\nof her enjoyment.\\n\\nthe evening came, the drawing-rooms were lighted up, the company assembled.\\nit was but a card party, it was but a mixture of those who had\\nnever met before, and those who met too often; a commonplace business,\\ntoo numerous for intimacy, too small for variety; but anne had never found\\nan evening shorter.  glowing and lovely in sensibility and happiness,\\nand more generally admired than she thought about or cared for,\\nshe had cheerful or forbearing feelings for every creature around her.\\nmr elliot was there; she avoided, but she could pity him.\\nthe wallises, she had amusement in understanding them.  lady dalrymple\\nand miss carteret--they would soon be innoxious cousins to her.\\nshe cared not for mrs clay, and had nothing to blush for in\\nthe public manners of her father and sister.  with the musgroves,\\nthere was the happy chat of perfect ease; with captain harville,\\nthe kind-hearted intercourse of brother and sister; with lady russell,\\nattempts at conversation, which a delicious consciousness cut short;\\nwith admiral and mrs croft, everything of peculiar cordiality and\\nfervent interest, which the same consciousness sought to conceal;\\nand with captain wentworth, some moments of communications\\ncontinually occurring, and always the hope of more, and always\\nthe knowledge of his being there.\\n\\nit was in one of these short meetings, each apparently occupied\\nin admiring a fine display of greenhouse plants, that she said--\\n\\n\"i have been thinking over the past, and trying impartially\\nto judge of the right and wrong, i mean with regard to myself;\\nand i must believe that i was right, much as i suffered from it,\\nthat i was perfectly right in being guided by the friend whom\\nyou will love better than you do now.  to me, she was in the place\\nof a parent.  do not mistake me, however.  i am not saying\\nthat she did not err in her advice.  it was, perhaps, one of those cases\\nin which advice is good or bad only as the event decides;\\nand for myself, i certainly never should, in any circumstance\\nof tolerable similarity, give such advice.  but i mean, that i was right\\nin submitting to her, and that if i had done otherwise, i should have\\nsuffered more in continuing the engagement than i did even in giving it up,\\nbecause i should have suffered in my conscience.  i have now,\\nas far as such a sentiment is allowable in human nature, nothing\\nto reproach myself with; and if i mistake not, a strong sense of duty\\nis no bad part of a woman\\'s portion.\"\\n\\nhe looked at her, looked at lady russell, and looking again at her,\\nreplied, as if in cool deliberation--\\n\\n\"not yet.  but there are hopes of her being forgiven in time.\\ni trust to being in charity with her soon.  but i too have been\\nthinking over the past, and a  question has suggested itself,\\nwhether there may not have been one person more my enemy\\neven than that lady?  my own self.  tell me if, when i returned\\nto england in the year eight, with a few thousand pounds,\\nand was posted into the laconia, if i had then written to you,\\nwould you have answered my letter?  would you, in short,\\nhave renewed the engagement then?\"\\n\\n\"would i!\" was all her answer; but the accent was decisive enough.\\n\\n\"good god!\" he cried, \"you would!  it is not that i did not think of it,\\nor desire it, as what could alone crown all my other success;\\nbut i was proud, too proud to ask again.  i did not understand you.\\ni shut my eyes, and would not understand you, or do you justice.\\nthis is a recollection which ought to make me forgive every one\\nsooner than myself.  six years of separation and suffering\\nmight have been spared.  it is a sort of pain, too, which is new to me.\\ni have been used to the gratification of believing myself to earn\\nevery blessing that i enjoyed.  i have valued myself on honourable toils\\nand just rewards.  like other great men under reverses,\" he added,\\nwith a smile. \"i must endeavour to subdue my mind to my fortune.\\ni must learn to brook being happier than i deserve.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 24\\n\\n\\nwho can be in doubt of what followed?  when any two young people\\ntake it into their heads to marry, they are pretty sure by perseverance\\nto carry their point, be they ever so poor, or ever so imprudent,\\nor ever so little likely to be necessary to each other\\'s ultimate comfort.\\nthis may be bad morality to conclude with, but i believe it to be truth;\\nand if such parties succeed, how should a captain wentworth and\\nan anne elliot, with the advantage of maturity of mind,\\nconsciousness of right, and one independent fortune between them,\\nfail of bearing down every opposition?  they might in fact,\\nhave borne down a great deal more than they met with, for there was\\nlittle to distress them beyond the want of graciousness and warmth.\\nsir walter made no objection, and elizabeth did nothing worse\\nthan look cold and unconcerned.  captain wentworth, with five-and-twenty\\nthousand pounds, and as high in his profession as merit and activity\\ncould place him, was no longer nobody.  he was now esteemed quite worthy\\nto address the daughter of a foolish, spendthrift baronet,\\nwho had not had principle or sense enough to maintain himself\\nin the situation in which providence had placed him, and who could\\ngive his daughter at present but a small part of the share\\nof ten thousand pounds which must be hers hereafter.\\n\\nsir walter, indeed, though he had no affection for anne,\\nand no vanity flattered, to make him really happy on the occasion,\\nwas very far from thinking it a bad match for her.  on the contrary,\\nwhen he saw more of captain wentworth, saw him repeatedly by daylight,\\nand eyed him well, he was very much struck by his personal claims,\\nand felt that his superiority of appearance might be not unfairly balanced\\nagainst her superiority of rank; and all this, assisted by\\nhis well-sounding name, enabled sir walter at last to prepare his pen,\\nwith a very good grace, for the insertion of the marriage\\nin the volume of honour.\\n\\nthe only one among them, whose opposition of feeling could excite\\nany serious anxiety was lady russell.  anne knew that lady russell\\nmust be suffering some pain in understanding and relinquishing mr elliot,\\nand be making some struggles to become truly acquainted with,\\nand do justice to captain wentworth.  this however was what\\nlady russell had now to do.  she must learn to feel that she had\\nbeen mistaken with regard to both; that she had been unfairly influenced\\nby appearances in each; that because captain wentworth\\'s manners\\nhad not suited her own ideas, she had been too quick in suspecting them\\nto indicate a character of dangerous impetuosity; and that because\\nmr elliot\\'s manners had precisely pleased her in their propriety\\nand correctness, their general politeness and suavity, she had been\\ntoo quick in receiving them as the certain result of the most correct\\nopinions and well-regulated mind.  there was nothing less\\nfor lady russell to do, than to admit that she had been\\npretty completely wrong, and to take up a new set of opinions\\nand of hopes.\\n\\nthere is a quickness of perception in some, a nicety in the discernment\\nof character, a natural penetration, in short, which no experience\\nin others can equal, and lady russell had been less gifted\\nin this part of understanding than her young friend.  but she was\\na very good woman, and if her second object was to be sensible\\nand well-judging, her first was to see anne happy.  she loved anne\\nbetter than she loved her own abilities; and when the awkwardness\\nof the beginning was over, found little hardship in attaching herself\\nas a mother to the man who was securing the happiness of her other child.\\n\\nof all the family, mary was probably the one most immediately gratified\\nby the circumstance.  it was creditable to have a sister married,\\nand she might flatter herself with having been greatly instrumental\\nto the connexion, by keeping anne with her in the autumn;\\nand as her own sister must be better than her husband\\'s sisters,\\nit was very agreeable that captain wentworth should be a richer man than\\neither captain benwick or charles hayter.  she had something to suffer,\\nperhaps, when they came into contact again, in seeing anne restored\\nto the rights of seniority, and the mistress of a very pretty landaulette;\\nbut she had a future to look forward to, of powerful consolation.\\nanne had no uppercross hall before her, no landed estate,\\nno headship of a family; and if they could but keep captain wentworth\\nfrom being made a baronet, she would not change situations with anne.\\n\\nit would be well for the eldest sister if she were equally satisfied\\nwith her situation, for a change is not very probable there.\\nshe had soon the mortification of seeing mr elliot withdraw,\\nand no one of proper condition has since presented himself to raise\\neven the unfounded hopes which sunk with him.\\n\\nthe news of his cousins anne\\'s engagement burst on mr elliot\\nmost unexpectedly.  it deranged his best plan of domestic happiness,\\nhis best hope of keeping sir walter single by the watchfulness\\nwhich a son-in-law\\'s rights would have given.  but, though discomfited\\nand disappointed, he could still do something for his own interest\\nand his own enjoyment.  he soon quitted bath; and on mrs clay\\'s\\nquitting it soon afterwards, and being next heard of as established\\nunder his protection in london, it was evident how double a game\\nhe had been playing, and how determined he was to save himself\\nfrom being cut out by one artful woman, at least.\\n\\nmrs clay\\'s affections had overpowered her interest, and she had sacrificed,\\nfor the young man\\'s sake, the possibility of scheming longer\\nfor sir walter.  she has abilities, however, as well as affections;\\nand it is now a doubtful point whether his cunning, or hers,\\nmay finally carry the day; whether, after preventing her from being\\nthe wife of sir walter, he may not be wheedled and caressed at last\\ninto making her the wife of sir william.\\n\\nit cannot be doubted that sir walter and elizabeth were shocked\\nand mortified by the loss of their companion, and the discovery of\\ntheir deception in her.  they had their great cousins, to be sure,\\nto resort to for comfort; but they must long feel that to flatter\\nand follow others, without being flattered and followed in turn,\\nis but a state of half enjoyment.\\n\\nanne, satisfied at a very early period of lady russell\\'s meaning\\nto love captain wentworth as she ought, had no other alloy\\nto the happiness of her prospects than what arose from the consciousness\\nof having no relations to bestow on him which a man of sense could value.\\nthere she felt her own inferiority very keenly.  the disproportion\\nin their fortune was nothing; it did not give her a moment\\'s regret;\\nbut to have no family to receive and estimate him properly,\\nnothing of respectability, of harmony, of good will to offer\\nin return for all the worth and all the prompt welcome which met her\\nin his brothers and sisters, was a source of as lively pain\\nas her mind could well be sensible of under circumstances of otherwise\\nstrong felicity.  she had but two friends in the world to add to his list,\\nlady russell and mrs smith.  to those, however, he was very well disposed\\nto attach himself.  lady russell, in spite of all her former transgressions,\\nhe could now value from his heart.  while he was not obliged to say\\nthat he believed her to have been right in originally dividing them,\\nhe was ready to say almost everything else in her favour,\\nand as for mrs smith, she had claims of various kinds to recommend her\\nquickly and permanently.\\n\\nher recent good offices by anne had been enough in themselves,\\nand their marriage, instead of depriving her of one friend,\\nsecured her two.  she was their earliest visitor in their settled life;\\nand captain wentworth, by putting her in the way of recovering\\nher husband\\'s property in the west indies, by writing for her,\\nacting for her, and seeing her through all the petty difficulties\\nof the case with the activity and exertion of a fearless man\\nand a determined friend, fully requited the services which\\nshe had rendered, or ever meant to render, to his wife.\\n\\nmrs smith\\'s enjoyments were not spoiled by this improvement of income,\\nwith some improvement of health, and the acquisition of such friends\\nto be often with, for her cheerfulness and mental alacrity did not\\nfail her; and while these prime supplies of good remained, she might have\\nbid defiance even to greater accessions of worldly prosperity.\\nshe might have been absolutely rich and perfectly healthy,\\nand yet be happy.  her spring of felicity was in the glow\\nof her spirits, as her friend anne\\'s was in the warmth of her heart.\\nanne was tenderness itself, and she had the full worth of it\\nin captain wentworth\\'s affection.  his profession was all that could ever\\nmake her friends wish that tenderness less, the dread of a future war\\nall that could dim her sunshine.  she gloried in being a sailor\\'s wife,\\nbut she must pay the tax of quick alarm for belonging to that profession\\nwhich is, if possible, more distinguished in its domestic virtues\\nthan in its national importance.\\n\\n\\n\\n        finis\\n\\n\\n\\n'"

              "'chapter 1\\n\\n\\nsir walter elliot, of kellynch hall, in somersetshire, was a man who,\\nfor his own amusement, never took up any book but the baronetage;\\nthere he found occupation for an idle hour, and consolation in a\\ndistressed one; there his faculties were roused into admiration and\\nrespect, by contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patents;\\nthere any unwelcome sensations, arising from domestic affairs\\nchanged naturally into pity and contempt as he turned over\\nthe almost endless creations of the last century; and there,\\nif every other leaf were powerless, he could read his own history\\nwith an interest which never failed.  this was the page at which\\nthe favourite volume always opened:\\n\\n           \"elliot of kellynch hall.\\n\\n\"walter elliot, born march 1, 1760, married, july 15, 1784, elizabeth,\\ndaughter of james stevenson, esq. of south park, in the county of\\ngloucester, by which lady (who died 1800) he has issue elizabeth,\\nborn june 1, 1785; anne, born august 9, 1787; a still-born son,\\nnovember 5, 1789; mary, born november 20, 1791.\"\\n\\nprecisely such had the paragraph originally stood from the printer\\'s hands;\\nbut sir walter had improved it by adding, for the information of\\nhimself and his family, these words, after the date of mary\\'s birth--\\n\"married, december 16, 1810, charles, son and heir of charles\\nmusgrove, esq. of uppercross, in the county of somerset,\"\\nand by inserting most accurately the day of the month on which\\nhe had lost his wife.\\n\\nthen followed the history and rise of the ancient and respectable family,\\nin the usual terms; how it had been first settled in cheshire;\\nhow mentioned in dugdale, serving the office of high sheriff,\\nrepresenting a borough in three successive parliaments,\\nexertions of loyalty, and dignity of baronet, in the first year\\nof charles ii, with all the marys and elizabeths they had married;\\nforming altogether two handsome duodecimo pages, and concluding with\\nthe arms and motto:--\"principal seat, kellynch hall, in the county\\nof somerset,\" and sir walter\\'s handwriting again in this finale:--\\n\\n\"heir presumptive, william walter elliot, esq., great grandson of\\nthe second sir walter.\"\\n\\nvanity was the beginning and the end of sir walter elliot\\'s character;\\nvanity of person and of situation.  he had been remarkably handsome\\nin his youth; and, at fifty-four, was still a very fine man.\\nfew women could think more of their personal appearance than he did,\\nnor could the valet of any new made lord be more delighted with\\nthe place he held in society.  he considered the blessing of beauty\\nas inferior only to the blessing of a baronetcy; and the sir walter elliot,\\nwho united these gifts, was the constant object of his warmest respect\\nand devotion.\\n\\nhis good looks and his rank had one fair claim on his attachment;\\nsince to them he must have owed a wife of very superior character\\nto any thing deserved by his own.  lady elliot had been an excellent woman,\\nsensible and amiable; whose judgement and conduct, if they might be\\npardoned the youthful infatuation which made her lady elliot,\\nhad never required indulgence afterwards.--she had humoured,\\nor softened, or concealed his failings, and promoted his real\\nrespectability for seventeen years; and though not the very happiest\\nbeing in the world herself, had found enough in her duties, her friends,\\nand her children, to attach her to life, and make it no matter of\\nindifference to her when she was called on to quit them.\\n--three girls, the two eldest sixteen and fourteen, was an awful legacy\\nfor a mother to bequeath, an awful charge rather, to confide to\\nthe authority and guidance of a conceited, silly father.\\nshe had, however, one very intimate friend, a sensible, deserving woman,\\nwho had been brought, by strong attachment to herself, to settle\\nclose by her, in the village of kellynch; and on her kindness and advice,\\nlady elliot mainly relied for the best help and maintenance of\\nthe good principles and instruction which she had been anxiously\\ngiving her daughters.\\n\\nthis friend, and sir walter, did not marry, whatever might have been\\nanticipated on that head by their acquaintance.  thirteen years\\nhad passed away since lady elliot\\'s death, and they were still\\nnear neighbours and intimate friends, and one remained a widower,\\nthe other a widow.\\n\\nthat lady russell, of steady age and character, and extremely\\nwell provided for, should have no thought of a second marriage,\\nneeds no apology to the public, which is rather apt to be unreasonably\\ndiscontented when a woman does marry again, than when she does not;\\nbut sir walter\\'s continuing in singleness requires explanation.\\nbe it known then, that sir walter, like a good father, (having met with\\none or two private disappointments in very unreasonable applications),\\nprided himself on remaining single for his dear daughters\\' sake.\\nfor one daughter, his eldest, he would really have given up any thing,\\nwhich he had not been very much tempted to do.  elizabeth had succeeded,\\nat sixteen, to all that was possible, of her mother\\'s rights\\nand consequence; and being very handsome, and very like himself,\\nher influence had always been great, and they had gone on together\\nmost happily.  his two other children were of very inferior value.\\nmary had acquired a little artificial importance, by becoming\\nmrs charles musgrove; but anne, with an elegance of mind and sweetness\\nof character, which must have placed her high with any people\\nof real understanding, was nobody with either father or sister;\\nher word had no weight, her convenience was always to give way--\\nshe was only anne.\\n\\nto lady russell, indeed, she was a most dear and highly valued\\ngod-daughter, favourite, and friend.  lady russell loved them all;\\nbut it was only in anne that she could fancy the mother to revive again.\\n\\na few years before, anne elliot had been a very pretty girl,\\nbut her bloom had vanished early; and as even in its height,\\nher father had found little to admire in her, (so totally different\\nwere her delicate features and mild dark eyes from his own),\\nthere could be nothing in them, now that she was faded and thin,\\nto excite his esteem. he had never indulged much hope, he had now none,\\nof ever reading her name in any other page of his favourite work.\\nall equality of alliance must rest with elizabeth, for mary had merely\\nconnected herself with an old country family of respectability and\\nlarge fortune, and had therefore given all the honour and received none:\\nelizabeth would, one day or other, marry suitably.\\n\\nit sometimes happens that a woman is handsomer at twenty-nine than\\nshe was ten years before; and, generally speaking, if there has been\\nneither ill health nor anxiety, it is a time of life at which scarcely any\\ncharm is lost.  it was so with elizabeth, still the same handsome\\nmiss elliot that she had begun to be thirteen years ago, and sir walter\\nmight be excused, therefore, in forgetting her age, or, at least,\\nbe deemed only half a fool, for thinking himself and elizabeth\\nas blooming as ever, amidst the wreck of the good looks of everybody else;\\nfor he could plainly see how old all the rest of his family and\\nacquaintance were growing.  anne haggard, mary coarse, every face\\nin the neighbourhood worsting, and the rapid increase of the crow\\'s foot\\nabout lady russell\\'s temples had long been a distress to him.\\n\\nelizabeth did not quite equal her father in personal contentment.\\nthirteen years had seen her mistress of kellynch hall, presiding and\\ndirecting with a self-possession and decision which could never have given\\nthe idea of her being younger than she was.  for thirteen years had\\nshe been doing the honours, and laying down the domestic law at home,\\nand leading the way to the chaise and four, and walking immediately after\\nlady russell out of all the drawing-rooms and dining-rooms in the country.\\nthirteen winters\\' revolving frosts had seen her opening every ball\\nof credit which a scanty neighbourhood afforded, and thirteen springs\\nshewn their blossoms, as she travelled up to london with her father,\\nfor a few weeks\\' annual enjoyment of the great world.  she had\\nthe remembrance of all this, she had the consciousness of being\\nnine-and-twenty to give her some regrets and some apprehensions;\\nshe was fully satisfied of being still quite as handsome as ever,\\nbut she felt her approach to the years of danger, and would have rejoiced\\nto be certain of being properly solicited by baronet-blood within\\nthe next twelvemonth or two.  then might she again take up\\nthe book of books with as much enjoyment as in her early youth,\\nbut now she liked it not.  always to be presented with the date of\\nher own birth and see no marriage follow but that of a youngest sister,\\nmade the book an evil; and more than once, when her father had left it\\nopen on the table near her, had she closed it, with averted eyes,\\nand pushed it away.\\n\\nshe had had a disappointment, moreover, which that book,\\nand especially the history of her own family, must ever present\\nthe remembrance of.  the heir presumptive, the very william walter\\nelliot, esq., whose rights had been so generously supported\\nby her father, had disappointed her.\\n\\nshe had, while a very young girl, as soon as she had known him to be,\\nin the event of her having no brother, the future baronet,\\nmeant to marry him, and her father had always meant that she should.\\nhe had not been known to them as a boy; but soon after lady elliot\\'s death,\\nsir walter had sought the acquaintance, and though his overtures\\nhad not been met with any warmth, he had persevered in seeking it,\\nmaking allowance for the modest drawing-back of youth; and, in one of\\ntheir spring excursions to london, when elizabeth was in her first bloom,\\nmr elliot had been forced into the introduction.\\n\\nhe was at that time a very young man, just engaged in the study of the law;\\nand elizabeth found him extremely agreeable, and every plan in his favour\\nwas confirmed.  he was invited to kellynch hall; he was talked of\\nand expected all the rest of the year; but he never came.\\nthe following spring he was seen again in town, found equally agreeable,\\nagain encouraged, invited, and expected, and again he did not come;\\nand the next tidings were that he was married.  instead of pushing\\nhis fortune in the line marked out for the heir of the house of elliot,\\nhe had purchased independence by uniting himself to a rich woman\\nof inferior birth.\\n\\nsir walter has resented it.  as the head of the house, he felt that\\nhe ought to have been consulted, especially after taking the young man\\nso publicly by the hand; \"for they must have been seen together,\"\\nhe observed, \"once at tattersall\\'s, and twice in the lobby of\\nthe house of commons.\"  his disapprobation was expressed,\\nbut apparently very little regarded.  mr elliot had attempted no apology,\\nand shewn himself as unsolicitous of being longer noticed by the family,\\nas sir walter considered him unworthy of it:  all acquaintance between\\nthem had ceased.\\n\\nthis very awkward history of mr elliot was still, after an interval\\nof several years, felt with anger by elizabeth, who had liked the man\\nfor himself, and still more for being her father\\'s heir, and whose\\nstrong family pride could see only in him a proper match for sir walter\\nelliot\\'s eldest daughter.  there was not a baronet from a to z whom\\nher feelings could have so willingly acknowledged as an equal.\\nyet so miserably had he conducted himself, that though she was\\nat this present time (the summer of 1814) wearing black ribbons\\nfor his wife, she could not admit him to be worth thinking of again.\\nthe disgrace of his first marriage might, perhaps, as there was\\nno reason to suppose it perpetuated by offspring, have been got over,\\nhad he not done worse; but he had, as by the accustomary intervention\\nof kind friends, they had been informed, spoken most disrespectfully\\nof them all, most slightingly and contemptuously of the very blood\\nhe belonged to, and the honours which were hereafter to be his own.\\nthis could not be pardoned.\\n\\nsuch were elizabeth elliot\\'s sentiments and sensations; such the cares\\nto alloy, the agitations to vary, the sameness and the elegance,\\nthe prosperity and the nothingness of her scene of life;\\nsuch the feelings to give interest to a long, uneventful residence\\nin one country circle, to fill the vacancies which there were no habits\\nof utility abroad, no talents or accomplishments for home, to occupy.\\n\\nbut now, another occupation and solicitude of mind was beginning to be\\nadded to these.  her father was growing distressed for money.\\nshe knew, that when he now took up the baronetage, it was to drive\\nthe heavy bills of his tradespeople, and the unwelcome hints of\\nmr shepherd, his agent, from his thoughts.  the kellynch property was good,\\nbut not equal to sir walter\\'s apprehension of the state required\\nin its possessor.  while lady elliot lived, there had been method,\\nmoderation, and economy, which had just kept him within his income;\\nbut with her had died all such right-mindedness, and from that period\\nhe had been constantly exceeding it.  it had not been possible\\nfor him to spend less; he had done nothing but what sir walter elliot\\nwas imperiously called on to do; but blameless as he was, he was\\nnot only growing dreadfully in debt, but was hearing of it so often,\\nthat it became vain to attempt concealing it longer, even partially,\\nfrom his daughter.  he had given her some hints of it the last spring\\nin town; he had gone so far even as to say, \"can we retrench?\\ndoes it occur to you that there is any one article in which\\nwe can retrench?\" and elizabeth, to do her justice, had, in the first\\nardour of female alarm, set seriously to think what could be done,\\nand had finally proposed these two branches of economy, to cut off\\nsome unnecessary charities, and to refrain from new furnishing\\nthe drawing-room; to which expedients she afterwards added\\nthe happy thought of their taking no present down to anne,\\nas had been the usual yearly custom.  but these measures,\\nhowever good in themselves, were insufficient for the real extent\\nof the evil, the whole of which sir walter found himself obliged\\nto confess to her soon afterwards.  elizabeth had nothing to propose\\nof deeper efficacy.  she felt herself ill-used and unfortunate,\\nas did her father; and they were neither of them able to devise\\nany means of lessening their expenses without compromising their dignity,\\nor relinquishing their comforts in a way not to be borne.\\n\\nthere was only a small part of his estate that sir walter could dispose of;\\nbut had every acre been alienable, it would have made no difference.\\nhe had condescended to mortgage as far as he had the power,\\nbut he would never condescend to sell.  no; he would never disgrace\\nhis name so far.  the kellynch estate should be transmitted whole\\nand entire, as he had received it.\\n\\ntheir two confidential friends, mr shepherd, who lived in\\nthe neighbouring market town, and lady russell, were called to advise them;\\nand both father and daughter seemed to expect that something should be\\nstruck out by one or the other to remove their embarrassments\\nand reduce their expenditure, without involving the loss of\\nany indulgence of taste or pride.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 2\\n\\n\\nmr shepherd, a civil, cautious lawyer, who, whatever might be his hold\\nor his views on sir walter, would rather have the disagreeable\\nprompted by anybody else, excused himself from offering the slightest hint,\\nand only begged leave to recommend an implicit reference to\\nthe excellent judgement of lady russell, from whose known good sense\\nhe fully expected to have just such resolute measures advised as\\nhe meant to see finally adopted.\\n\\nlady russell was most anxiously zealous on the subject, and gave it\\nmuch serious consideration.  she was a woman rather of sound than of\\nquick abilities, whose difficulties in coming to any decision\\nin this instance were great, from the opposition of two leading principles.\\nshe was of strict integrity herself, with a delicate sense of honour;\\nbut she was as desirous of saving sir walter\\'s feelings, as solicitous\\nfor the credit of the family, as aristocratic in her ideas of what\\nwas due to them, as anybody of sense and honesty could well be.\\nshe was a benevolent, charitable, good woman, and capable of\\nstrong attachments, most correct in her conduct, strict in her notions\\nof decorum, and with manners that were held a standard of good-breeding.\\nshe had a cultivated mind, and was, generally speaking,\\nrational and consistent; but she had prejudices on the side of ancestry;\\nshe had a value for rank and consequence, which blinded her a little\\nto the faults of those who possessed them.  herself the widow of\\nonly a knight, she gave the dignity of a baronet all its due;\\nand sir walter, independent of his claims as an old acquaintance,\\nan attentive neighbour, an obliging landlord, the husband of her\\nvery dear friend, the father of anne and her sisters, was,\\nas being sir walter, in her apprehension, entitled to a great deal\\nof compassion and consideration under his present difficulties.\\n\\nthey must retrench; that did not admit of a doubt.  but she was\\nvery anxious to have it done with the least possible pain to him\\nand elizabeth. she drew up plans of economy, she made exact calculations,\\nand she did what nobody else thought of doing:  she consulted anne,\\nwho never seemed considered by the others as having any interest\\nin the question. she consulted, and in a degree was influenced by her\\nin marking out the scheme of retrenchment which was at last submitted\\nto sir walter. every emendation of anne\\'s had been on the side of\\nhonesty against importance.  she wanted more vigorous measures,\\na more complete reformation, a quicker release from debt,\\na much higher tone of indifference for everything but justice and equity.\\n\\n\"if we can persuade your father to all this,\" said lady russell,\\nlooking over her paper, \"much may be done.  if he will adopt\\nthese regulations, in seven years he will be clear; and i hope\\nwe may be able to convince him and elizabeth, that kellynch hall has\\na respectability in itself which cannot be affected by these reductions;\\nand that the true dignity of sir walter elliot will be very far from\\nlessened in the eyes of sensible people, by acting like a man of principle.\\nwhat will he be doing, in fact, but what very many of our first families\\nhave done, or ought to do?  there will be nothing singular in his case;\\nand it is singularity which often makes the worst part of our suffering,\\nas it always does of our conduct.  i have great hope of prevailing.\\nwe must be serious and decided; for after all, the person who\\nhas contracted debts must pay them; and though a great deal is due to\\nthe feelings of the gentleman, and the head of a house, like your father,\\nthere is still more due to the character of an honest man.\"\\n\\nthis was the principle on which anne wanted her father to be proceeding,\\nhis friends to be urging him.  she considered it as an act\\nof indispensable duty to clear away the claims of creditors with\\nall the expedition which the most comprehensive retrenchments\\ncould secure, and saw no dignity in anything short of it.\\nshe wanted it to be prescribed, and felt as a duty.  she rated\\nlady russell\\'s influence highly; and as to the severe degree\\nof self-denial which her own conscience prompted, she believed\\nthere might be little more difficulty in persuading them to a complete,\\nthan to half a reformation.  her knowledge of her father\\nand elizabeth inclined her to think that the sacrifice of one pair\\nof horses would be hardly less painful than of both, and so on,\\nthrough the whole list of lady russell\\'s too gentle reductions.\\n\\nhow anne\\'s more rigid requisitions might have been taken\\nis of little consequence.  lady russell\\'s had no success at all:\\ncould not be put up with, were not to be borne. \"what! every comfort\\nof life knocked off!  journeys, london, servants, horses, table--\\ncontractions and restrictions every where!  to live no longer\\nwith the decencies even of a private gentleman!  no, he would sooner\\nquit kellynch hall at once, than remain in it on such disgraceful terms.\"\\n\\n\"quit kellynch hall.\"  the hint was immediately taken up by mr shepherd,\\nwhose interest was involved in the reality of sir walter\\'s retrenching,\\nand who was perfectly persuaded that nothing would be done without\\na change of abode.  \"since the idea had been started in the very quarter\\nwhich ought to dictate, he had no scruple,\" he said, \"in confessing\\nhis judgement to be entirely on that side.  it did not appear to him\\nthat sir walter could materially alter his style of living in a house\\nwhich had such a character of hospitality and ancient dignity to support.\\nin any other place sir walter might judge for himself; and would\\nbe looked up to, as regulating the modes of life in whatever way\\nhe might choose to model his household.\"\\n\\nsir walter would quit kellynch hall; and after a very few days more\\nof doubt and indecision, the great question of whither he should go\\nwas settled, and the first outline of this important change made out.\\n\\nthere had been three alternatives, london, bath, or another house\\nin the country.  all anne\\'s wishes had been for the latter.\\na small house in their own neighbourhood, where they might still have\\nlady russell\\'s society, still be near mary, and still have the pleasure\\nof sometimes seeing the lawns and groves of kellynch, was the object\\nof her ambition.  but the usual fate of anne attended her,\\nin having something very opposite from her inclination fixed on.\\nshe disliked bath, and did not think it agreed with her;\\nand bath was to be her home.\\n\\nsir walter had at first thought more of london; but mr shepherd felt\\nthat he could not be trusted in london, and had been skilful enough\\nto dissuade him from it, and make bath preferred.  it was a much safer\\nplace for a gentleman in his predicament:  he might there be important\\nat comparatively little expense.  two material advantages of bath\\nover london had of course been given all their weight:  its more convenient\\ndistance from kellynch, only fifty miles, and lady russell\\'s spending\\nsome part of every winter there; and to the very great satisfaction\\nof lady russell, whose first views on the projected change had been\\nfor bath, sir walter and elizabeth were induced to believe that\\nthey should lose neither consequence nor enjoyment by settling there.\\n\\nlady russell felt obliged to oppose her dear anne\\'s known wishes.\\nit would be too much to expect sir walter to descend into a small house\\nin his own neighbourhood.  anne herself would have found\\nthe mortifications of it more than she foresaw, and to sir walter\\'s\\nfeelings they must have been dreadful.  and with regard to anne\\'s\\ndislike of bath, she considered it as a prejudice and mistake arising,\\nfirst, from the circumstance of her having been three years\\nat school there, after her mother\\'s death; and secondly,\\nfrom her happening to be not in perfectly good spirits the only winter\\nwhich she had afterwards spent there with herself.\\n\\nlady russell was fond of bath, in short, and disposed to think\\nit must suit them all; and as to her young friend\\'s health,\\nby passing all the warm months with her at kellynch lodge,\\nevery danger would be avoided; and it was in fact, a change which must\\ndo both health and spirits good.  anne had been too little from home,\\ntoo little seen. her spirits were not high.  a larger society\\nwould improve them.  she wanted her to be more known.\\n\\nthe undesirableness of any other house in the same neighbourhood\\nfor sir walter was certainly much strengthened by one part,\\nand a very material part of the scheme, which had been happily\\nengrafted on the beginning.  he was not only to quit his home,\\nbut to see it in the hands of others; a trial of fortitude,\\nwhich stronger heads than sir walter\\'s have found too much.\\nkellynch hall was to be let.  this, however, was a profound secret,\\nnot to be breathed beyond their own circle.\\n\\nsir walter could not have borne the degradation of being known\\nto design letting his house.  mr shepherd had once mentioned the word\\n\"advertise,\" but never dared approach it again.  sir walter spurned\\nthe idea of its being offered in any manner; forbad the slightest hint\\nbeing dropped of his having such an intention; and it was only on\\nthe supposition of his being spontaneously solicited by some most\\nunexceptionable applicant, on his own terms, and as a great favour,\\nthat he would let it at all.\\n\\nhow quick come the reasons for approving what we like!  lady russell had\\nanother excellent one at hand, for being extremely glad that sir walter\\nand his family were to remove from the country.  elizabeth had been\\nlately forming an intimacy, which she wished to see interrupted.\\nit was with the daughter of mr shepherd, who had returned,\\nafter an unprosperous marriage, to her father\\'s house, with\\nthe additional burden of two children.  she was a clever young woman,\\nwho understood the art of pleasing--the art of pleasing, at least,\\nat kellynch hall; and who had made herself so acceptable to miss elliot,\\nas to have been already staying there more than once, in spite of all\\nthat lady russell, who thought it a friendship quite out of place,\\ncould hint of caution and reserve.\\n\\nlady russell, indeed, had scarcely any influence with elizabeth,\\nand seemed to love her, rather because she would love her,\\nthan because elizabeth deserved it.  she had never received from her more\\nthan outward attention, nothing beyond the observances of complaisance;\\nhad never succeeded in any point which she wanted to carry,\\nagainst previous inclination.  she had been repeatedly very earnest\\nin trying to get anne included in the visit to london, sensibly open\\nto all the injustice and all the discredit of the selfish arrangements\\nwhich shut her out, and on many lesser occasions had endeavoured\\nto give elizabeth the advantage of her own better judgement and experience;\\nbut always in vain:  elizabeth would go her own way; and never had she\\npursued it in more decided opposition to lady russell than in\\nthis selection of mrs clay; turning from the society of so deserving\\na sister, to bestow her affection and confidence on one who ought\\nto have been nothing to her but the object of distant civility.\\n\\nfrom situation, mrs clay was, in lady russell\\'s estimate, a very unequal,\\nand in her character she believed a very dangerous companion;\\nand a removal that would leave mrs clay behind, and bring a choice\\nof more suitable intimates within miss elliot\\'s reach, was therefore\\nan object of first-rate importance.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 3\\n\\n\\n\"i must take leave to observe, sir walter,\" said mr shepherd\\none morning at kellynch hall, as he laid down the newspaper,\\n\"that the present juncture is much in our favour.  this peace will\\nbe turning all our rich naval officers ashore.  they will be\\nall wanting a home.  could not be a better time, sir walter,\\nfor having a choice of tenants, very responsible tenants.\\nmany a noble fortune has been made during the war.  if a rich admiral\\nwere to come in our way, sir walter--\"\\n\\n\"he would be a very lucky man, shepherd,\" replied sir walter;\\n\"that\\'s all i have to remark.  a prize indeed would kellynch hall\\nbe to him; rather the greatest prize of all, let him have taken\\never so many before; hey, shepherd?\"\\n\\nmr shepherd laughed, as he knew he must, at this wit, and then added--\\n\\n\"i presume to observe, sir walter, that, in the way of business,\\ngentlemen of the navy are well to deal with.  i have had a little knowledge\\nof their methods of doing business; and i am free to confess that they\\nhave very liberal notions, and are as likely to make desirable tenants\\nas any set of people one should meet with.  therefore, sir walter,\\nwhat i would take leave to suggest is, that if in consequence of\\nany rumours getting abroad of your intention; which must be contemplated\\nas a possible thing, because we know how difficult it is to keep\\nthe actions and designs of one part of the world from the notice\\nand curiosity of the other; consequence has its tax; i, john shepherd,\\nmight conceal any family-matters that i chose, for nobody would think it\\nworth their while to observe me; but sir walter elliot has eyes upon him\\nwhich it may be very difficult to elude; and therefore, thus much\\ni venture upon, that it will not greatly surprise me if,\\nwith all our caution, some rumour of the truth should get abroad;\\nin the supposition of which, as i was going to observe, since applications\\nwill unquestionably follow, i should think any from our wealthy\\nnaval commanders particularly worth attending to; and beg leave to add,\\nthat two hours will bring me over at any time, to save you\\nthe trouble of replying.\"\\n\\nsir walter only nodded.  but soon afterwards, rising and pacing the room,\\nhe observed sarcastically--\\n\\n\"there are few among the gentlemen of the navy, i imagine, who would\\nnot be surprised to find themselves in a house of this description.\"\\n\\n\"they would look around them, no doubt, and bless their good fortune,\"\\nsaid mrs clay, for mrs clay was present:  her father had driven her over,\\nnothing being of so much use to mrs clay\\'s health as a drive to kellynch:\\n\"but i quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might be\\na very desirable tenant.  i have known a good deal of the profession;\\nand besides their liberality, they are so neat and careful\\nin all their ways!  these valuable pictures of yours, sir walter,\\nif you chose to leave them, would be perfectly safe.  everything in\\nand about the house would be taken such excellent care of!\\nthe gardens and shrubberies would be kept in almost as high order\\nas they are now.  you need not be afraid, miss elliot, of your own\\nsweet flower gardens being neglected.\"\\n\\n\"as to all that,\" rejoined sir walter coolly, \"supposing i were induced\\nto let my house, i have by no means made up my mind as to the privileges\\nto be annexed to it.  i am not particularly disposed to favour a tenant.\\nthe park would be open to him of course, and few navy officers,\\nor men of any other description, can have had such a range;\\nbut what restrictions i might impose on the use of the pleasure-grounds,\\nis another thing.  i am not fond of the idea of my shrubberies being\\nalways approachable; and i should recommend miss elliot to be on her guard\\nwith respect to her flower garden.  i am very little disposed\\nto grant a tenant of kellynch hall any extraordinary favour,\\ni assure you, be he sailor or soldier.\"\\n\\nafter a short pause, mr shepherd presumed to say--\\n\\n\"in all these cases, there are established usages which\\nmake everything plain and easy between landlord and tenant.\\nyour interest, sir walter, is in pretty safe hands.  depend upon me\\nfor taking care that no tenant has more than his just rights.\\ni venture to hint, that sir walter elliot cannot be half so jealous\\nfor his own, as john shepherd will be for him.\"\\n\\nhere anne spoke--\\n\\n\"the navy, i think, who have done so much for us, have at least\\nan equal claim with any other set of men, for all the comforts and\\nall the privileges which any home can give.  sailors work hard enough\\nfor their comforts, we must all allow.\"\\n\\n\"very true, very true.  what miss anne says, is very true,\"\\nwas mr shepherd\\'s rejoinder, and \"oh! certainly,\" was his daughter\\'s;\\nbut sir walter\\'s remark was, soon afterwards--\\n\\n\"the profession has its utility, but i should be sorry to see\\nany friend of mine belonging to it.\"\\n\\n\"indeed!\" was the reply, and with a look of surprise.\\n\\n\"yes; it is in two points offensive to me; i have two strong grounds\\nof objection to it.  first, as being the means of bringing persons\\nof obscure birth into undue distinction, and raising men to honours\\nwhich their fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of; and secondly,\\nas it cuts up a man\\'s youth and vigour most horribly; a sailor grows old\\nsooner than any other man.  i have observed it all my life.\\na man is in greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise\\nof one whose father, his father might have disdained to speak to,\\nand of becoming prematurely an object of disgust himself, than in\\nany other line.  one day last spring, in town, i was in company\\nwith two men, striking instances of what i am talking of;\\nlord st ives, whose father we all know to have been a country curate,\\nwithout bread to eat; i was to give place to lord st ives,\\nand a certain admiral baldwin, the most deplorable-looking personage\\nyou can imagine; his face the colour of mahogany, rough and rugged\\nto the last degree; all lines and wrinkles, nine grey hairs of a side,\\nand nothing but a dab of powder at top.  `in the name of heaven,\\nwho is that old fellow?\\' said i to a friend of mine who was standing near,\\n(sir basil morley).  `old fellow!\\' cried sir basil, `it is admiral baldwin.\\nwhat do you take his age to be?\\'  `sixty,\\' said i, `or perhaps sixty-two.\\'\\n`forty,\\' replied sir basil, `forty, and no more.\\'  picture to yourselves\\nmy amazement; i shall not easily forget admiral baldwin.\\ni never saw quite so wretched an example of what a sea-faring life can do;\\nbut to a degree, i know it is the same with them all:  they are all\\nknocked about, and exposed to every climate, and every weather,\\ntill they are not fit to be seen.  it is a pity they are not knocked\\non the head at once, before they reach admiral baldwin\\'s age.\"\\n\\n\"nay, sir walter,\" cried mrs clay, \"this is being severe indeed.\\nhave a little mercy on the poor men.  we are not all born to be handsome.\\nthe sea is no beautifier, certainly; sailors do grow old betimes;\\ni have observed it; they soon lose the look of youth.  but then,\\nis not it the same with many other professions, perhaps most other?\\nsoldiers, in active service, are not at all better off:  and even in\\nthe quieter professions, there is a toil and a labour of the mind,\\nif not of the body, which seldom leaves a man\\'s looks to the natural\\neffect of time.  the lawyer plods, quite care-worn; the physician\\nis up at all hours, and travelling in all weather; and even\\nthe clergyman--\" she stopt a moment to consider what might\\ndo for the clergyman;--\"and even the clergyman, you know is obliged\\nto go into infected rooms, and expose his health and looks to\\nall the injury of a poisonous atmosphere.  in fact, as i have\\nlong been convinced, though every profession is necessary and honourable\\nin its turn, it is only the lot of those who are not obliged to follow any,\\nwho can live in a regular way, in the country, choosing their own hours,\\nfollowing their own pursuits, and living on their own property,\\nwithout the torment of trying for more; it is only their lot, i say,\\nto hold the blessings of health and a good appearance to the utmost:\\ni know no other set of men but what lose something of their personableness\\nwhen they cease to be quite young.\"\\n\\nit seemed as if mr shepherd, in this anxiety to bespeak\\nsir walter\\'s good will towards a naval officer as tenant,\\nhad been gifted with foresight; for the very first application\\nfor the house was from an admiral croft, with whom he shortly afterwards\\nfell into company in attending the quarter sessions at taunton; and indeed,\\nhe had received a hint of the admiral from a london correspondent.\\nby the report which he hastened over to kellynch to make,\\nadmiral croft was a native of somersetshire, who having acquired\\na very handsome fortune, was wishing to settle in his own country,\\nand had come down to taunton in order to look at some advertised places\\nin that immediate neighbourhood, which, however, had not suited him;\\nthat accidentally hearing--(it was just as he had foretold,\\nmr shepherd observed, sir walter\\'s concerns could not be kept a secret,)--\\naccidentally hearing of the possibility of kellynch hall being to let,\\nand understanding his (mr shepherd\\'s) connection with the owner,\\nhe had introduced himself to him in order to make particular inquiries,\\nand had, in the course of a pretty long conference, expressed as strong\\nan inclination for the place as a man who knew it only by description\\ncould feel; and given mr shepherd, in his explicit account of himself,\\nevery proof of his being a most responsible, eligible tenant.\\n\\n\"and who is admiral croft?\" was sir walter\\'s cold suspicious inquiry.\\n\\nmr shepherd answered for his being of a gentleman\\'s family,\\nand mentioned a place; and anne, after the little pause which followed,\\nadded--\\n\\n\"he is a rear admiral of the white.  he was in the trafalgar action,\\nand has been in the east indies since; he was stationed there,\\ni believe, several years.\"\\n\\n\"then i take it for granted,\" observed sir walter, \"that his face\\nis about as orange as the cuffs and capes of my livery.\"\\n\\nmr shepherd hastened to assure him, that admiral croft was a very hale,\\nhearty, well-looking man, a little weather-beaten, to be sure,\\nbut not much, and quite the gentleman in all his notions and behaviour;\\nnot likely to make the smallest difficulty about terms, only wanted\\na comfortable home, and to get into it as soon as possible;\\nknew he must pay for his convenience; knew what rent a ready-furnished\\nhouse of that consequence might fetch; should not have been surprised\\nif sir walter had asked more; had inquired about the manor;\\nwould be glad of the deputation, certainly, but made no great point of it;\\nsaid he sometimes took out a gun, but never killed; quite the gentleman.\\n\\nmr shepherd was eloquent on the subject; pointing out all\\nthe circumstances of the admiral\\'s family, which made him\\npeculiarly desirable as a tenant.  he was a married man,\\nand without children; the very state to be wished for.  a house was\\nnever taken good care of, mr shepherd observed, without a lady:\\nhe did not know, whether furniture might not be in danger of suffering\\nas much where there was no lady, as where there were many children.\\na lady, without a family, was the very best preserver of furniture\\nin the world.  he had seen mrs croft, too; she was at taunton\\nwith the admiral, and had been present almost all the time they were\\ntalking the matter over.\\n\\n\"and a very well-spoken, genteel, shrewd lady, she seemed to be,\"\\ncontinued he; \"asked more questions about the house, and terms,\\nand taxes, than the admiral himself, and seemed more conversant\\nwith business; and moreover, sir walter, i found she was not quite\\nunconnected in this country, any more than her husband; that is to say,\\nshe is sister to a gentleman who did live amongst us once;\\nshe told me so herself:  sister to the gentleman who lived\\na few years back at monkford.  bless me! what was his name?\\nat this moment i cannot recollect his name, though i have heard it so lately.\\npenelope, my dear, can you help me to the name of the gentleman\\nwho lived at monkford:  mrs croft\\'s brother?\"\\n\\nbut mrs clay was talking so eagerly with miss elliot, that she did not\\nhear the appeal.\\n\\n\"i have no conception whom you can mean, shepherd; i remember\\nno gentleman resident at monkford since the time of old governor trent.\"\\n\\n\"bless me! how very odd!  i shall forget my own name soon, i suppose.\\na name that i am so very well acquainted with; knew the gentleman\\nso well by sight; seen him a hundred times; came to consult me once,\\ni remember, about a trespass of one of his neighbours; farmer\\'s man\\nbreaking into his orchard; wall torn down; apples stolen;\\ncaught in the fact; and afterwards, contrary to my judgement,\\nsubmitted to an amicable compromise.  very odd indeed!\"\\n\\nafter waiting another moment--\\n\\n\"you mean mr wentworth, i suppose?\" said anne.\\n\\nmr shepherd was all gratitude.\\n\\n\"wentworth was the very name!  mr wentworth was the very man.\\nhe had the curacy of monkford, you know, sir walter, some time back,\\nfor two or three years.  came there about the year ---5, i take it.\\nyou remember him, i am sure.\"\\n\\n\"wentworth?  oh! ay,--mr wentworth, the curate of monkford.\\nyou misled me by the term gentleman.  i thought you were speaking of\\nsome man of property:  mr wentworth was nobody, i remember;\\nquite unconnected; nothing to do with the strafford family.\\none wonders how the names of many of our nobility become so common.\"\\n\\nas mr shepherd perceived that this connexion of the crofts did them\\nno service with sir walter, he mentioned it no more; returning,\\nwith all his zeal, to dwell on the circumstances more indisputably\\nin their favour; their age, and number, and fortune; the high idea\\nthey had formed of kellynch hall, and extreme solicitude for\\nthe advantage of renting it; making it appear as if they ranked\\nnothing beyond the happiness of being the tenants of sir walter elliot:\\nan extraordinary taste, certainly, could they have been supposed in\\nthe secret of sir walter\\'s estimate of the dues of a tenant.\\n\\nit succeeded, however; and though sir walter must ever look with\\nan evil eye on anyone intending to inhabit that house, and think them\\ninfinitely too well off in being permitted to rent it on the highest terms,\\nhe was talked into allowing mr shepherd to proceed in the treaty,\\nand authorising him to wait on admiral croft, who still remained\\nat taunton, and fix a day for the house being seen.\\n\\nsir walter was not very wise; but still he had experience enough\\nof the world to feel, that a more unobjectionable tenant,\\nin all essentials, than admiral croft bid fair to be, could hardly offer.\\nso far went his understanding; and his vanity supplied a little\\nadditional soothing, in the admiral\\'s situation in life, which was just\\nhigh enough, and not too high.  \"i have let my house to admiral croft,\"\\nwould sound extremely well; very much better than to any mere mr--;\\na mr (save, perhaps, some half dozen in the nation,) always needs\\na note of explanation.  an admiral speaks his own consequence,\\nand, at the same time, can never make a baronet look small.\\nin all their dealings and intercourse, sir walter elliot must ever\\nhave the precedence.\\n\\nnothing could be done without a reference to elizabeth:\\nbut her inclination was growing so strong for a removal,\\nthat she was happy to have it fixed and expedited by a tenant at hand;\\nand not a word to suspend decision was uttered by her.\\n\\nmr shepherd was completely empowered to act; and no sooner had\\nsuch an end been reached, than anne, who had been a most attentive listener\\nto the whole, left the room, to seek the comfort of cool air for her\\nflushed cheeks; and as she walked along a favourite grove, said,\\nwith a gentle sigh, \"a few months more, and he, perhaps,\\nmay be walking here.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 4\\n\\n\\nhe was not mr wentworth, the former curate of monkford,\\nhowever suspicious appearances may be, but a captain frederick wentworth,\\nhis brother, who being made commander in consequence of the action\\noff st domingo, and not immediately employed, had come into somersetshire,\\nin the summer of 1806; and having no parent living, found a home\\nfor half a year at monkford.  he was, at that time, a remarkably fine\\nyoung man, with a great deal of intelligence, spirit, and brilliancy;\\nand anne an extremely pretty girl, with gentleness, modesty, taste,\\nand feeling.  half the sum of attraction, on either side, might have\\nbeen enough, for he had nothing to do, and she had hardly anybody to love;\\nbut the encounter of such lavish recommendations could not fail.\\nthey were gradually acquainted, and when acquainted, rapidly and\\ndeeply in love.  it would be difficult to say which had seen\\nhighest perfection in the other, or which had been the happiest:\\nshe, in receiving his declarations and proposals, or he in\\nhaving them accepted.\\n\\na short period of exquisite felicity followed, and but a short one.\\ntroubles soon arose.  sir walter, on being applied to, without actually\\nwithholding his consent, or saying it should never be, gave it all\\nthe negative of great astonishment, great coldness, great silence,\\nand a professed resolution of doing nothing for his daughter.\\nhe thought it a very degrading alliance; and lady russell, though with\\nmore tempered and pardonable pride, received it as a most unfortunate one.\\n\\nanne elliot, with all her claims of birth, beauty, and mind,\\nto throw herself away at nineteen; involve herself at nineteen\\nin an engagement with a young man, who had nothing but himself\\nto recommend him, and no hopes of attaining affluence, but in the chances\\nof a most uncertain profession, and no connexions to secure\\neven his farther rise in the profession, would be, indeed, a throwing away,\\nwhich she grieved to think of!  anne elliot, so young; known to so few,\\nto be snatched off by a stranger without alliance or fortune;\\nor rather sunk by him into a state of most wearing, anxious,\\nyouth-killing dependence!  it must not be, if by any fair interference\\nof friendship, any representations from one who had almost a mother\\'s love,\\nand mother\\'s rights, it would be prevented.\\n\\ncaptain wentworth had no fortune.  he had been lucky in his profession;\\nbut spending freely, what had come freely, had realized nothing.\\nbut he was confident that he should soon be rich:\\nfull of life and ardour, he knew that he should soon have a ship,\\nand soon be on a station that would lead to everything he wanted.\\nhe had always been lucky; he knew he should be so still.\\nsuch confidence, powerful in its own warmth, and bewitching in\\nthe wit which often expressed it, must have been enough for anne;\\nbut lady russell saw it very differently.  his sanguine temper,\\nand fearlessness of mind, operated very differently on her.\\nshe saw in it but an aggravation of the evil.  it only added a\\ndangerous character to himself.  he was brilliant, he was headstrong.\\nlady russell had little taste for wit, and of anything approaching\\nto imprudence a horror.  she deprecated the connexion in every light.\\n\\nsuch opposition, as these feelings produced, was more than\\nanne could combat.  young and gentle as she was, it might yet\\nhave been possible to withstand her father\\'s ill-will,\\nthough unsoftened by one kind word or look on the part of her sister;\\nbut lady russell, whom she had always loved and relied on, could not,\\nwith such steadiness of opinion, and such tenderness of manner,\\nbe continually advising her in vain.  she was persuaded to believe\\nthe engagement a wrong thing:  indiscreet, improper, hardly capable\\nof success, and not deserving it.  but it was not a merely selfish caution,\\nunder which she acted, in putting an end to it.  had she not\\nimagined herself consulting his good, even more than her own,\\nshe could hardly have given him up.  the belief of being prudent,\\nand self-denying, principally for his advantage, was her chief consolation,\\nunder the misery of a parting, a final parting; and every consolation\\nwas required, for she had to encounter all the additional pain of opinions,\\non his side, totally unconvinced and unbending, and of his feeling himself\\nill used by so forced a relinquishment.  he had left the country\\nin consequence.\\n\\na few months had seen the beginning and the end of their acquaintance;\\nbut not with a few months ended anne\\'s share of suffering from it.\\nher attachment and regrets had, for a long time, clouded every\\nenjoyment of youth, and an early loss of bloom and spirits\\nhad been their lasting effect.\\n\\nmore than seven years were gone since this little history\\nof sorrowful interest had reached its close; and time had\\nsoftened down much, perhaps nearly all of peculiar attachment to him,\\nbut she had been too dependent on time alone; no aid had been given\\nin change of place (except in one visit to bath soon after the rupture),\\nor in any novelty or enlargement of society.  no one had ever\\ncome within the kellynch circle, who could bear a comparison with\\nfrederick wentworth, as he stood in her memory.  no second attachment,\\nthe only thoroughly natural, happy, and sufficient cure,\\nat her time of life, had been possible to the nice tone of her mind,\\nthe fastidiousness of her taste, in the small limits of the society\\naround them.  she had been solicited, when about two-and-twenty,\\nto change her name, by the young man, who not long afterwards found\\na more willing mind in her younger sister; and lady russell had\\nlamented her refusal; for charles musgrove was the eldest son of a man,\\nwhose landed property and general importance were second in that country,\\nonly to sir walter\\'s, and of good character and appearance;\\nand however lady russell might have asked yet for something more,\\nwhile anne was nineteen, she would have rejoiced to see her at twenty-two\\nso respectably removed from the partialities and injustice of\\nher father\\'s house, and settled so permanently near herself.\\nbut in this case, anne had left nothing for advice to do;\\nand though lady russell, as satisfied as ever with her own discretion,\\nnever wished the past undone, she began now to have the anxiety\\nwhich borders on hopelessness for anne\\'s being tempted, by some man\\nof talents and independence, to enter a state for which she held her\\nto be peculiarly fitted by her warm affections and domestic habits.\\n\\nthey knew not each other\\'s opinion, either its constancy or its change,\\non the one leading point of anne\\'s conduct, for the subject was never\\nalluded to; but anne, at seven-and-twenty, thought very differently\\nfrom what she had been made to think at nineteen.  she did not blame\\nlady russell, she did not blame herself for having been guided by her;\\nbut she felt that were any young person, in similar circumstances,\\nto apply to her for counsel, they would never receive any of such\\ncertain immediate wretchedness, such uncertain future good.\\nshe was persuaded that under every disadvantage of disapprobation at home,\\nand every anxiety attending his profession, all their probable fears,\\ndelays, and disappointments, she should yet have been a happier woman\\nin maintaining the engagement, than she had been in the sacrifice of it;\\nand this, she fully believed, had the usual share, had even more than\\nthe usual share of all such solicitudes and suspense been theirs,\\nwithout reference to the actual results of their case, which,\\nas it happened, would have bestowed earlier prosperity than\\ncould be reasonably calculated on.  all his sanguine expectations,\\nall his confidence had been justified.  his genius and ardour\\nhad seemed to foresee and to command his prosperous path.\\nhe had, very soon after their engagement ceased, got employ:\\nand all that he had told her would follow, had taken place.\\nhe had distinguished himself, and early gained the other step in rank,\\nand must now, by successive captures, have made a handsome fortune.\\nshe had only navy lists and newspapers for her authority,\\nbut she could not doubt his being rich; and, in favour of his constancy,\\nshe had no reason to believe him married.\\n\\nhow eloquent could anne elliot have been! how eloquent, at least,\\nwere her wishes on the side of early warm attachment, and a cheerful\\nconfidence in futurity, against that over-anxious caution which\\nseems to insult exertion and distrust providence!  she had been forced\\ninto prudence in her youth, she learned romance as she grew older:\\nthe natural sequel of an unnatural beginning.\\n\\nwith all these circumstances, recollections and feelings,\\nshe could not hear that captain wentworth\\'s sister was likely\\nto live at kellynch without a revival of former pain; and many a stroll,\\nand many a sigh, were necessary to dispel the agitation of the idea.\\nshe often told herself it was folly, before she could harden her nerves\\nsufficiently to feel the continual discussion of the crofts\\nand their business no evil.  she was assisted, however, by that\\nperfect indifference and apparent unconsciousness, among the only three\\nof her own friends in the secret of the past, which seemed almost to deny\\nany recollection of it.  she could do justice to the superiority\\nof lady russell\\'s motives in this, over those of her father and elizabeth;\\nshe could honour all the better feelings of her calmness;\\nbut the general air of oblivion among them was highly important\\nfrom whatever it sprung; and in the event of admiral croft\\'s really\\ntaking kellynch hall, she rejoiced anew over the conviction which\\nhad always been most grateful to her, of the past being known to\\nthose three only among her connexions, by whom no syllable,\\nshe believed, would ever be whispered, and in the trust that among his,\\nthe brother only with whom he had been residing, had received\\nany information of their short-lived engagement.  that brother had been\\nlong removed from the country and being a sensible man, and, moreover,\\na single man at the time, she had a fond dependence on no human creature\\'s\\nhaving heard of it from him.\\n\\nthe sister, mrs croft, had then been out of england, accompanying\\nher husband on a foreign station, and her own sister, mary,\\nhad been at school while it all occurred; and never admitted by\\nthe pride of some, and the delicacy of others, to the smallest knowledge\\nof it afterwards.\\n\\nwith these supports, she hoped that the acquaintance between herself\\nand the crofts, which, with lady russell, still resident in kellynch,\\nand mary fixed only three miles off, must be anticipated,\\nneed not involve any particular awkwardness.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 5\\n\\n\\non the morning appointed for admiral and mrs croft\\'s seeing kellynch hall,\\nanne found it most natural to take her almost daily walk to lady russell\\'s,\\nand keep out of the way till all was over; when she found it most natural\\nto be sorry that she had missed the opportunity of seeing them.\\n\\nthis meeting of the two parties proved highly satisfactory,\\nand decided the whole business at once.  each lady was previously\\nwell disposed for an agreement, and saw nothing, therefore,\\nbut good manners in the other; and with regard to the gentlemen,\\nthere was such an hearty good humour, such an open, trusting liberality\\non the admiral\\'s side, as could not but influence sir walter,\\nwho had besides been flattered into his very best and most polished\\nbehaviour by mr shepherd\\'s assurances of his being known, by report,\\nto the admiral, as a model of good breeding.\\n\\nthe house and grounds, and furniture, were approved, the crofts\\nwere approved, terms, time, every thing, and every body, was right;\\nand mr shepherd\\'s clerks were set to work, without there having been\\na single preliminary difference to modify of all that\\n\"this indenture sheweth.\"\\n\\nsir walter, without hesitation, declared the admiral to be\\nthe best-looking sailor he had ever met with, and went so far as to say,\\nthat if his own man might have had the arranging of his hair,\\nhe should not be ashamed of being seen with him any where;\\nand the admiral, with sympathetic cordiality, observed to his wife\\nas they drove back through the park, \"i thought we should soon\\ncome to a deal, my dear, in spite of what they told us at taunton.\\nthe baronet will never set the thames on fire, but there seems to be\\nno harm in him.\"  reciprocal compliments, which would have been\\nesteemed about equal.\\n\\nthe crofts were to have possession at michaelmas; and as sir walter\\nproposed removing to bath in the course of the preceding month,\\nthere was no time to be lost in making every dependent arrangement.\\n\\nlady russell, convinced that anne would not be allowed to be of any use,\\nor any importance, in the choice of the house which they were\\ngoing to secure, was very unwilling to have her hurried away so soon,\\nand wanted to make it possible for her to stay behind till she might\\nconvey her to bath herself after christmas; but having engagements\\nof her own which must take her from kellynch for several weeks,\\nshe was unable to give the full invitation she wished, and anne\\nthough dreading the possible heats of september in all the white glare\\nof bath, and grieving to forego all the influence so sweet and so sad\\nof the autumnal months in the country, did not think that,\\neverything considered, she wished to remain.  it would be most right,\\nand most wise, and, therefore must involve least suffering\\nto go with the others.\\n\\nsomething occurred, however, to give her a different duty.\\nmary, often a little unwell, and always thinking a great deal\\nof her own complaints, and always in the habit of claiming anne\\nwhen anything was the matter, was indisposed; and foreseeing\\nthat she should not have a day\\'s health all the autumn, entreated,\\nor rather required her, for it was hardly entreaty, to come to\\nuppercross cottage, and bear her company as long as she should want her,\\ninstead of going to bath.\\n\\n\"i cannot possibly do without anne,\" was mary\\'s reasoning;\\nand elizabeth\\'s reply was, \"then i am sure anne had better stay,\\nfor nobody will want her in bath.\"\\n\\nto be claimed as a good, though in an improper style, is at least\\nbetter than being rejected as no good at all; and anne, glad to\\nbe thought of some use, glad to have anything marked out as a duty,\\nand certainly not sorry to have the scene of it in the country,\\nand her own dear country, readily agreed to stay.\\n\\nthis invitation of mary\\'s removed all lady russell\\'s difficulties,\\nand it was consequently soon settled that anne should not go to bath\\ntill lady russell took her, and that all the intervening time\\nshould be divided between uppercross cottage and kellynch lodge.\\n\\nso far all was perfectly right; but lady russell was almost startled\\nby the wrong of one part of the kellynch hall plan, when it burst on her,\\nwhich was, mrs clay\\'s being engaged to go to bath with sir walter\\nand elizabeth, as a most important and valuable assistant to the latter\\nin all the business before her.  lady russell was extremely sorry\\nthat such a measure should have been resorted to at all, wondered,\\ngrieved, and feared; and the affront it contained to anne,\\nin mrs clay\\'s being of so much use, while anne could be of none,\\nwas a very sore aggravation.\\n\\nanne herself was become hardened to such affronts; but she felt\\nthe imprudence of the arrangement quite as keenly as lady russell.\\nwith a great deal of quiet observation, and a knowledge,\\nwhich she often wished less, of her father\\'s character, she was\\nsensible that results the most serious to his family from the intimacy\\nwere more than possible.  she did not imagine that her father\\nhad at present an idea of the kind.  mrs clay had freckles,\\nand a projecting tooth, and a clumsy wrist, which he was continually\\nmaking severe remarks upon, in her absence; but she was young,\\nand certainly altogether well-looking, and possessed, in an acute mind\\nand assiduous pleasing manners, infinitely more dangerous attractions\\nthan any merely personal might have been.  anne was so impressed\\nby the degree of their danger, that she could not excuse herself\\nfrom trying to make it perceptible to her sister.  she had little hope\\nof success; but elizabeth, who in the event of such a reverse would be\\nso much more to be pitied than herself, should never, she thought,\\nhave reason to reproach her for giving no warning.\\n\\nshe spoke, and seemed only to offend.  elizabeth could not conceive\\nhow such an absurd suspicion should occur to her, and indignantly\\nanswered for each party\\'s perfectly knowing their situation.\\n\\n\"mrs clay,\" said she, warmly, \"never forgets who she is;\\nand as i am rather better acquainted with her sentiments than you can be,\\ni can assure you, that upon the subject of marriage they are\\nparticularly nice, and that she reprobates all inequality of condition\\nand rank more strongly than most people.  and as to my father,\\ni really should not have thought that he, who has kept himself single\\nso long for our sakes, need be suspected now.  if mrs clay were\\na very beautiful woman, i grant you, it might be wrong to have her\\nso much with me; not that anything in the world, i am sure,\\nwould induce my father to make a degrading match, but he might\\nbe rendered unhappy.  but poor mrs clay who, with all her merits,\\ncan never have been reckoned tolerably pretty, i really think poor\\nmrs clay may be staying here in perfect safety.  one would imagine\\nyou had never heard my father speak of her personal misfortunes,\\nthough i know you must fifty times.  that tooth of her\\'s\\nand those freckles.  freckles do not disgust me so very much\\nas they do him.  i have known a face not materially disfigured by a few,\\nbut he abominates them.  you must have heard him notice\\nmrs clay\\'s freckles.\"\\n\\n\"there is hardly any personal defect,\" replied anne,\\n\"which an agreeable manner might not gradually reconcile one to.\"\\n\\n\"i think very differently,\" answered elizabeth, shortly;\\n\"an agreeable manner may set off handsome features, but can never\\nalter plain ones.  however, at any rate, as i have a great deal more\\nat stake on this point than anybody else can have, i think it\\nrather unnecessary in you to be advising me.\"\\n\\nanne had done; glad that it was over, and not absolutely hopeless\\nof doing good.  elizabeth, though resenting the suspicion,\\nmight yet be made observant by it.\\n\\nthe last office of the four carriage-horses was to draw sir walter,\\nmiss elliot, and mrs clay to bath.  the party drove off in very good spirits;\\nsir walter prepared with condescending bows for all the afflicted\\ntenantry and cottagers who might have had a hint to show themselves,\\nand anne walked up at the same time, in a sort of desolate tranquillity,\\nto the lodge, where she was to spend the first week.\\n\\nher friend was not in better spirits than herself. lady russell felt this\\nbreak-up of the family exceedingly.  their respectability was\\nas dear to her as her own, and a daily intercourse had become\\nprecious by habit.  it was painful to look upon their deserted grounds,\\nand still worse to anticipate the new hands they were to fall into;\\nand to escape the solitariness and the melancholy of so altered a village,\\nand be out of the way when admiral and mrs croft first arrived,\\nshe had determined to make her own absence from home begin\\nwhen she must give up anne.  accordingly their removal was made together,\\nand anne was set down at uppercross cottage, in the first stage\\nof lady russell\\'s journey.\\n\\nuppercross was a moderate-sized village, which a few years back\\nhad been completely in the old english style, containing only\\ntwo houses superior in appearance to those of the yeomen and labourers;\\nthe mansion of the squire, with its high walls, great gates, and old trees,\\nsubstantial and unmodernized, and the compact, tight parsonage,\\nenclosed in its own neat garden, with a vine and a pear-tree\\ntrained round its casements; but upon the marriage of the young \\'squire,\\nit had received the improvement of a farm-house elevated into a cottage,\\nfor his residence, and uppercross cottage, with its veranda,\\nfrench windows, and other prettiness, was quite as likely to catch\\nthe traveller\\'s eye as the more consistent and considerable aspect\\nand premises of the great house, about a quarter of a mile farther on.\\n\\nhere anne had often been staying.  she knew the ways of uppercross\\nas well as those of kellynch.  the two families were so continually meeting,\\nso much in the habit of running in and out of each other\\'s house\\nat all hours, that it was rather a surprise to her to find mary alone;\\nbut being alone, her being unwell and out of spirits was almost\\na matter of course.  though better endowed than the elder sister,\\nmary had not anne\\'s understanding nor temper.  while well, and happy,\\nand properly attended to, she had great good humour and excellent spirits;\\nbut any indisposition sunk her completely.  she had no resources\\nfor solitude; and inheriting a considerable share of the elliot\\nself-importance, was very prone to add to every other distress\\nthat of fancying herself neglected and ill-used.  in person, she was\\ninferior to both sisters, and had, even in her bloom, only reached\\nthe dignity of being \"a fine girl.\"  she was now lying on the faded sofa\\nof the pretty little drawing-room, the once elegant furniture of which\\nhad been gradually growing shabby, under the influence of four summers\\nand two children; and, on anne\\'s appearing, greeted her with--\\n\\n\"so, you are come at last!  i began to think i should never see you.\\ni am so ill i can hardly speak.  i have not seen a creature\\nthe whole morning!\"\\n\\n\"i am sorry to find you unwell,\" replied anne.  \"you sent me\\nsuch a good account of yourself on thursday!\"\\n\\n\"yes, i made the best of it; i always do:  but i was very far from well\\nat the time; and i do not think i ever was so ill in my life\\nas i have been all this morning:  very unfit to be left alone, i am sure.\\nsuppose i were to be seized of a sudden in some dreadful way,\\nand not able to ring the bell!  so, lady russell would not get out.\\ni do not think she has been in this house three times this summer.\"\\n\\nanne said what was proper, and enquired after her husband.\\n\"oh! charles is out shooting.  i have not seen him since seven o\\'clock.\\nhe would go, though i told him how ill i was.  he said he should not\\nstay out long; but he has never come back, and now it is almost one.\\ni assure you, i have not seen a soul this whole long morning.\"\\n\\n\"you have had your little boys with you?\"\\n\\n\"yes, as long as i could bear their noise; but they are so unmanageable\\nthat they do me more harm than good.  little charles does not mind\\na word i say, and walter is growing quite as bad.\"\\n\\n\"well, you will soon be better now,\" replied anne, cheerfully.\\n\"you know i always cure you when i come.  how are your neighbours\\nat the great house?\"\\n\\n\"i can give you no account of them.  i have not seen one of them to-day,\\nexcept mr musgrove, who just stopped and spoke through the window,\\nbut without getting off his horse; and though i told him how ill i was,\\nnot one of them have been near me.  it did not happen to suit\\nthe miss musgroves, i suppose, and they never put themselves\\nout of their way.\"\\n\\n\"you will see them yet, perhaps, before the morning is gone.\\nit is early.\"\\n\\n\"i never want them, i assure you.  they talk and laugh a great deal\\ntoo much for me.  oh! anne, i am so very unwell!  it was quite unkind\\nof you not to come on thursday.\"\\n\\n\"my dear mary, recollect what a comfortable account you sent me of yourself!\\nyou wrote in the cheerfullest manner, and said you were perfectly well,\\nand in no hurry for me; and that being the case, you must be aware\\nthat my wish would be to remain with lady russell to the last:\\nand besides what i felt on her account, i have really been so busy,\\nhave had so much to do, that i could not very conveniently have\\nleft kellynch sooner.\"\\n\\n\"dear me! what can you possibly have to do?\"\\n\\n\"a great many things, i assure you.  more than i can recollect\\nin a moment; but i can tell you some.  i have been making\\na duplicate of the catalogue of my father\\'s books and pictures.\\ni have been several times in the garden with mackenzie,\\ntrying to understand, and make him understand, which of elizabeth\\'s plants\\nare for lady russell.  i have had all my own little concerns\\nto arrange, books and music to divide, and all my trunks to repack,\\nfrom not having understood in time what was intended as to the waggons:\\nand one thing i have had to do, mary, of a more trying nature:\\ngoing to almost every house in the parish, as a sort of take-leave.\\ni was told that they wished it.  but all these things took up\\na great deal of time.\"\\n\\n\"oh! well!\" and after a moment\\'s pause, \"but you have never asked me\\none word about our dinner at the pooles yesterday.\"\\n\\n\"did you go then?  i have made no enquiries, because i concluded\\nyou must have been obliged to give up the party.\"\\n\\n\"oh yes! i went.  i was very well yesterday; nothing at all\\nthe matter with me till this morning.  it would have been strange\\nif i had not gone.\"\\n\\n\"i am very glad you were well enough, and i hope you had a pleasant party.\"\\n\\n\"nothing remarkable.  one always knows beforehand what the dinner will be,\\nand who will be there; and it is so very uncomfortable not having\\na carriage of one\\'s own.  mr and mrs musgrove took me, and we were\\nso crowded!  they are both so very large, and take up so much room;\\nand mr musgrove always sits forward.  so, there was i, crowded into\\nthe back seat with henrietta and louise; and i think it very likely\\nthat my illness to-day may be owing to it.\"\\n\\na little further perseverance in patience and forced cheerfulness\\non anne\\'s side produced nearly a cure on mary\\'s.  she could soon\\nsit upright on the sofa, and began to hope she might be able\\nto leave it by dinner-time.  then, forgetting to think of it,\\nshe was at the other end of the room, beautifying a nosegay;\\nthen, she ate her cold meat; and then she was well enough\\nto propose a little walk.\\n\\n\"where shall we go?\" said she, when they were ready.  \"i suppose\\nyou will not like to call at the great house before they have\\nbeen to see you?\"\\n\\n\"i have not the smallest objection on that account,\" replied anne.\\n\"i should never think of standing on such ceremony with people i know\\nso well as mrs and the miss musgroves.\"\\n\\n\"oh! but they ought to call upon you as soon as possible.\\nthey ought to feel what is due to you as my sister.  however,\\nwe may as well go and sit with them a little  while, and when we\\nhave that over, we can enjoy our walk.\"\\n\\nanne had always thought such a style of intercourse highly imprudent;\\nbut she had ceased to endeavour to check it, from believing that,\\nthough there were on each side continual subjects of offence,\\nneither family could now do without it.  to the great house accordingly\\nthey went, to sit the full half hour in the old-fashioned square parlour,\\nwith a small carpet and shining floor, to which the present\\ndaughters of the house were gradually giving the proper air of confusion\\nby a grand piano-forte and a harp, flower-stands and little tables\\nplaced in every direction.  oh! could the originals of the portraits\\nagainst the wainscot, could the gentlemen in brown velvet and\\nthe ladies in blue satin have seen what was going on, have been conscious\\nof such an overthrow of all order and neatness!  the portraits themselves\\nseemed to be staring in astonishment.\\n\\nthe musgroves, like their houses, were in a state of alteration,\\nperhaps of improvement.  the father and mother were in the old\\nenglish style, and the young people in the new.  mr and mrs musgrove\\nwere a very good sort of people; friendly and hospitable,\\nnot much educated, and not at all elegant.  their children had\\nmore modern minds and manners.  there was a numerous family;\\nbut the only two grown up, excepting charles, were henrietta and louisa,\\nyoung ladies of nineteen and twenty, who had brought from school at exeter\\nall the usual stock of accomplishments, and were now like thousands\\nof other young ladies, living to be fashionable, happy, and merry.\\ntheir dress had every advantage, their faces were rather pretty,\\ntheir spirits extremely good, their manner unembarrassed and pleasant;\\nthey were of consequence at home, and favourites abroad.\\nanne always contemplated them as some of the happiest creatures\\nof her acquaintance; but still, saved as we all are, by some\\ncomfortable feeling of superiority from wishing for the possibility\\nof exchange, she would not have given up her own more elegant\\nand cultivated mind for all their enjoyments; and envied them nothing\\nbut that seemingly perfect good understanding and agreement together,\\nthat good-humoured mutual affection, of which she had known\\nso little herself with either of her sisters.\\n\\nthey were received with great cordiality.  nothing seemed amiss\\non the side of the great house family, which was generally,\\nas anne very well knew, the least to blame.  the half hour was\\nchatted away pleasantly enough; and she was not at all surprised\\nat the end of it, to have their walking party joined by both\\nthe miss musgroves, at mary\\'s particular invitation.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 6\\n\\n\\nanne had not wanted this visit to uppercross, to learn that a removal\\nfrom one set of people to another, though at a distance of only three miles,\\nwill often include a total change of conversation, opinion, and idea.\\nshe had never been staying there before, without being struck by it,\\nor without wishing that other elliots could have her advantage\\nin seeing how unknown, or unconsidered there, were the affairs\\nwhich at kellynch hall were treated as of such general publicity\\nand pervading interest; yet, with all this experience, she believed\\nshe must now submit to feel that another lesson, in the art of knowing\\nour own nothingness beyond our own circle, was become necessary for her;\\nfor certainly, coming as she did, with a heart full of the subject\\nwhich had been completely occupying both houses in kellynch for many weeks,\\nshe had expected rather more curiosity and sympathy than she found\\nin the separate but very similar remark of mr and mrs musgrove:\\n\"so, miss anne, sir walter and your sister are gone; and what part of bath\\ndo you think they will settle in?\" and this, without much\\nwaiting for an answer; or in the young ladies\\' addition of,\\n\"i hope we shall be in bath in the winter; but remember, papa,\\nif we do go, we must be in a good situation:  none of your\\nqueen squares for us!\" or in the anxious supplement from mary, of--\\n\"upon my word, i shall be pretty well off, when you are all gone away\\nto be happy at bath!\"\\n\\nshe could only resolve to avoid such self-delusion in future,\\nand think with heightened gratitude of the extraordinary blessing\\nof having one such truly sympathising friend as lady russell.\\n\\nthe mr musgroves had their own game to guard, and to destroy,\\ntheir own horses, dogs, and newspapers to engage them, and the females\\nwere fully occupied in all the other common subjects of housekeeping,\\nneighbours, dress, dancing, and music.  she acknowledged it to be\\nvery fitting, that every little social commonwealth should dictate\\nits own matters of discourse; and hoped, ere long, to become\\na not unworthy member of the one she was now transplanted into.\\nwith the prospect of spending at least two months at uppercross,\\nit was highly incumbent on her to clothe her imagination, her memory,\\nand all her ideas in as much of uppercross as possible.\\n\\nshe had no dread of these two months.  mary was not so repulsive\\nand unsisterly as elizabeth, nor so inaccessible to all influence of hers;\\nneither was there anything among the other component parts\\nof the cottage inimical to comfort.  she was always on friendly terms\\nwith her brother-in-law; and in the children, who loved her nearly as well,\\nand respected her a great deal more than their mother, she had\\nan object of interest, amusement, and wholesome exertion.\\n\\ncharles musgrove was civil and agreeable; in sense and temper he was\\nundoubtedly superior to his wife, but not of powers, or conversation,\\nor grace, to make the past, as they were connected together,\\nat all a dangerous contemplation; though, at the same time,\\nanne could believe, with lady russell, that a more equal match\\nmight have greatly improved him; and that a woman of real understanding\\nmight have given more consequence to his character, and more usefulness,\\nrationality, and elegance to his habits and pursuits.  as it was,\\nhe did nothing with much zeal, but sport; and his time was otherwise\\ntrifled away, without benefit from books or anything else.\\nhe had very good spirits, which never seemed much affected by\\nhis wife\\'s occasional lowness, bore with her unreasonableness\\nsometimes to anne\\'s admiration, and upon the whole, though there was\\nvery often a little disagreement (in which she had sometimes more share\\nthan she wished, being appealed to by both parties), they might pass\\nfor a happy couple.  they were always perfectly agreed in the want\\nof more money, and a strong inclination for a handsome present\\nfrom his father; but here, as on most topics, he had the superiority,\\nfor while mary thought it a great shame that such a present was not made,\\nhe always contended for his father\\'s having many other uses for his money,\\nand a right to spend it as he liked.\\n\\nas to the management of their children, his theory was much better\\nthan his wife\\'s, and his practice not so bad.  \"i could manage them\\nvery well, if it were not for mary\\'s interference,\" was what\\nanne often heard him say, and had a good deal of faith in;\\nbut when listening in turn to mary\\'s reproach of \"charles spoils\\nthe children so that i cannot get them into any order,\" she never had\\nthe smallest temptation to say, \"very true.\"\\n\\none of the least agreeable circumstances of her residence there\\nwas her being treated with too much confidence by all parties,\\nand being too much in the secret of the complaints of each house.\\nknown to have some influence with her sister, she was continually requested,\\nor at least receiving hints to exert it, beyond what was practicable.\\n\"i wish you could persuade mary not to be always fancying herself ill,\"\\nwas charles\\'s language; and, in an unhappy mood, thus spoke mary:\\n\"i do believe if charles were to see me dying, he would not think\\nthere was anything the matter with me.  i am sure, anne, if you would,\\nyou might persuade him that i really am very ill--a great deal worse\\nthan i ever own.\"\\n\\nmary\\'s declaration was, \"i hate sending the children to the great house,\\nthough their grandmamma is always wanting to see them, for she humours\\nand indulges them to such a degree, and gives them so much trash\\nand sweet things, that they are sure to come back sick and cross\\nfor the rest of the day.\"  and mrs musgrove took the first opportunity\\nof being alone with anne, to say, \"oh! miss anne, i cannot help wishing\\nmrs charles had a little of your method with those children.\\nthey are quite different creatures with you!  but to be sure,\\nin general they are so spoilt!  it is a pity you cannot put your sister\\nin the way of managing them.  they are as fine healthy children\\nas ever were seen, poor little dears! without partiality;\\nbut mrs charles knows no more how they should be treated--!\\nbless me! how troublesome they are sometimes.  i assure you, miss anne,\\nit prevents my wishing to see them at our house so often as\\ni otherwise should.  i believe mrs charles is not quite pleased\\nwith my not inviting them oftener; but you know it is very bad\\nto have children with one that one is obligated to be checking\\nevery moment; \"don\\'t do this,\" and \"don\\'t do that;\"  or that one can\\nonly keep in tolerable order by more cake than is good for them.\"\\n\\nshe had this communication, moreover, from mary.  \"mrs musgrove thinks\\nall her servants so steady, that it would be high treason\\nto call it in question; but i am sure, without exaggeration,\\nthat her upper house-maid and laundry-maid, instead of being\\nin their business, are gadding about the village, all day long.\\ni meet them wherever i go; and i declare, i never go twice into my nursery\\nwithout seeing something of them.  if jemima were not the trustiest,\\nsteadiest creature in the world, it would be enough to spoil her;\\nfor she tells me, they are always tempting her to take a walk with them.\"\\nand on mrs musgrove\\'s side, it was, \"i make a rule of never interfering\\nin any of my daughter-in-law\\'s concerns, for i know it would not do;\\nbut i shall tell you, miss anne, because you may be able to set things\\nto rights, that i have no very good opinion of mrs charles\\'s nursery-maid:\\ni hear strange stories of her; she is always upon the gad; and from\\nmy own knowledge, i can declare, she is such a fine-dressing lady,\\nthat she is enough to ruin any servants she comes near.\\nmrs charles quite swears by her, i know; but i just give you this hint,\\nthat you may be upon the watch; because, if you see anything amiss,\\nyou need not be afraid of mentioning it.\"\\n\\nagain, it was mary\\'s complaint, that mrs musgrove was very apt\\nnot to give her the precedence that was her due, when they dined\\nat the great house with other families; and she did not see any reason\\nwhy she was to be considered so much at home as to lose her place.\\nand one day when anne was walking with only the musgroves, one of them\\nafter talking of rank, people of rank, and jealousy of rank, said,\\n\"i have no scruple of observing to you, how nonsensical some persons are\\nabout their place, because all the world knows how easy and indifferent\\nyou are about it; but i wish anybody could give mary a hint that\\nit would be a great deal better if she were not so very tenacious,\\nespecially if she would not be always putting herself forward to take\\nplace of mamma.  nobody doubts her right to have precedence of mamma,\\nbut it would be more becoming in her not to be always insisting on it.\\nit is not that mamma cares about it the least in the world,\\nbut i know it is taken notice of by many persons.\"\\n\\nhow was anne to set all these matters to rights?  she could do little more\\nthan listen patiently, soften every grievance, and excuse each\\nto the other; give them all hints of the forbearance necessary\\nbetween such near neighbours, and make those hints broadest\\nwhich were meant for her sister\\'s benefit.\\n\\nin all other respects, her visit began and proceeded very well.\\nher own spirits improved by change of place and subject,\\nby being removed three miles from kellynch; mary\\'s ailments lessened\\nby having a constant companion, and their daily intercourse\\nwith the other family, since there was neither superior affection,\\nconfidence, nor employment in the cottage, to be interrupted by it,\\nwas rather an advantage.  it was certainly carried nearly as far as possible,\\nfor they met every morning, and hardly ever spent an evening asunder;\\nbut she believed they should not have done so well without the sight\\nof mr and mrs musgrove\\'s respectable forms in the usual places,\\nor without the talking, laughing, and singing of their daughters.\\n\\nshe played a great deal better than either of the miss musgroves,\\nbut having no voice, no knowledge of the harp, and no fond parents,\\nto sit by and fancy themselves delighted, her performance was\\nlittle thought of, only out of civility, or to refresh the others,\\nas she was well aware.  she knew that when she played she was\\ngiving pleasure only to herself; but this was no new sensation.\\nexcepting one short period of her life, she had never, since the age\\nof fourteen, never since the loss of her dear mother, known the happiness\\nof being listened to, or encouraged by any just appreciation or real taste.\\nin music she had been always used to feel alone in the world;\\nand mr and mrs musgrove\\'s fond partiality for their own daughters\\'\\nperformance, and total indifference to any other person\\'s,\\ngave her much more pleasure for their sakes, than mortification\\nfor her own.\\n\\nthe party at the great house was sometimes increased by other company.\\nthe neighbourhood was not large, but the musgroves were visited\\nby everybody, and had more dinner-parties, and more callers,\\nmore visitors by invitation and by chance, than any other family.\\nthere were more completely popular.\\n\\nthe girls were wild for dancing; and the evenings ended, occasionally,\\nin an unpremeditated little ball.  there was a family of cousins\\nwithin a walk of uppercross, in less affluent circumstances,\\nwho depended on the musgroves for all their pleasures:  they would come\\nat any time, and help play at anything, or dance anywhere; and anne,\\nvery much preferring the office of musician to a more active post,\\nplayed country dances to them by the hour together; a kindness which\\nalways recommended her musical powers to the notice of mr and mrs musgrove\\nmore than anything else, and often drew this compliment;--\\n\"well done, miss anne! very well done indeed!  lord bless me!\\nhow those little fingers of yours fly about!\"\\n\\nso passed the first three weeks.  michaelmas came; and now anne\\'s heart\\nmust be in kellynch again.  a beloved home made over to others;\\nall the precious rooms and furniture, groves, and prospects,\\nbeginning to own other eyes and other limbs!  she could not\\nthink of much else on the 29th of september; and she had this\\nsympathetic touch in the evening from mary, who, on having occasion\\nto note down the day of the month, exclaimed, \"dear me, is not this\\nthe day the crofts were to come to kellynch?  i am glad i did not\\nthink of it before.  how low it makes me!\"\\n\\nthe crofts took possession with true naval alertness, and were\\nto be visited.  mary deplored the necessity for herself.\\n\"nobody knew how much she should suffer.  she should put it off\\nas long as she could;\" but was not easy till she had talked charles\\ninto driving her over on an early day, and was in a very animated,\\ncomfortable state of imaginary agitation, when she came back.\\nanne had very sincerely rejoiced in there being no means of her going.\\nshe wished, however to see the crofts, and was glad to be within\\nwhen the visit was returned.  they came:  the master of the house\\nwas not at home, but the two sisters were together; and as it chanced\\nthat mrs croft fell to the share of anne, while the admiral sat by mary,\\nand made himself very agreeable by his good-humoured notice\\nof her little boys, she was well able to watch for a likeness,\\nand if it failed her in the features, to catch it in the voice,\\nor in the turn of sentiment and expression.\\n\\nmrs croft, though neither tall nor fat, had a squareness,\\nuprightness, and vigour of form, which gave importance to her person.\\nshe had bright dark eyes, good teeth, and altogether an agreeable face;\\nthough her reddened and weather-beaten complexion, the consequence\\nof her having been almost as much at sea as her husband, made her seem to\\nhave lived some years longer in the world than her real eight-and-thirty.\\nher manners were open, easy, and decided, like one who had\\nno distrust of herself, and no doubts of what to do; without any\\napproach to coarseness, however, or any want of good humour.\\nanne gave her credit, indeed, for feelings of great consideration\\ntowards herself, in all that related to kellynch, and it pleased her:\\nespecially, as she had satisfied herself in the very first half minute,\\nin the instant even of introduction, that there was not the smallest\\nsymptom of any knowledge or suspicion on mrs croft\\'s side, to give a bias\\nof any sort.  she was quite easy on that head, and consequently\\nfull of strength and courage, till for a moment electrified by\\nmrs croft\\'s suddenly saying,--\\n\\n\"it was you, and not your sister, i find, that my brother had\\nthe pleasure of being acquainted with, when he was in this country.\"\\n\\nanne hoped she had outlived the age of blushing; but the age of emotion\\nshe certainly had not.\\n\\n\"perhaps you may not have heard that he is married?\" added mrs croft.\\n\\nshe could now answer as she ought; and was happy to feel,\\nwhen mrs croft\\'s next words explained it to be mr wentworth\\nof whom she spoke, that she had said nothing which might not do\\nfor either brother. she immediately felt how reasonable it was,\\nthat mrs croft should be thinking and speaking of edward,\\nand not of frederick; and with shame at her own forgetfulness\\napplied herself to the knowledge of their former neighbour\\'s\\npresent state with proper interest.\\n\\nthe rest was all tranquillity; till, just as they were moving,\\nshe heard the admiral say to mary--\\n\\n\"we are expecting a brother of mrs croft\\'s here soon; i dare say\\nyou know him by name.\"\\n\\nhe was cut short by the eager attacks of the little boys,\\nclinging to him like an old friend, and declaring he should not go;\\nand being too much engrossed by proposals of carrying them away\\nin his coat pockets, &c., to have another moment for finishing\\nor recollecting what he had begun, anne was left to persuade herself,\\nas well as she could, that the same brother must still be in question.\\nshe could not, however, reach such a degree of certainty,\\nas not to be anxious to hear whether anything had been said on the subject\\nat the other house, where the crofts had previously been calling.\\n\\nthe folks of the great house were to spend the evening of this day\\nat the cottage; and it being now too late in the year for such visits\\nto be made on foot, the coach was beginning to be listened for,\\nwhen the youngest miss musgrove walked in.  that she was coming\\nto apologize, and that they should have to spend the evening by themselves,\\nwas the first black idea; and mary was quite ready to be affronted,\\nwhen louisa made all right by saying, that she only came on foot,\\nto leave more room for the harp, which was bringing in the carriage.\\n\\n\"and i will tell you our reason,\" she added, \"and all about it.\\ni am come on to give you notice, that papa and mamma are\\nout of spirits this evening, especially mamma; she is thinking so much\\nof poor richard!  and we agreed it would be best to have the harp,\\nfor it seems to amuse her more than the piano-forte.  i will tell you\\nwhy she is out of spirits.  when the crofts called this morning,\\n(they called here afterwards, did not they?), they happened to say,\\nthat her brother, captain wentworth, is just returned to england,\\nor paid off, or something, and is coming to see them almost directly;\\nand most unluckily it came into mamma\\'s head, when they were gone,\\nthat wentworth, or something very like it, was the name of\\npoor richard\\'s captain at one time; i do not know when or where,\\nbut a great while before he died, poor fellow!  and upon looking over\\nhis letters and things, she found it was so, and is perfectly sure\\nthat this must be the very man, and her head is quite full of it,\\nand of poor richard!  so we must be as merry as we can, that she may not\\nbe dwelling upon such gloomy things.\"\\n\\nthe real circumstances of this pathetic piece of family history were,\\nthat the musgroves had had the ill fortune of a very troublesome,\\nhopeless son; and the good fortune to lose him before he reached\\nhis twentieth year; that he had been sent to sea because he was stupid\\nand unmanageable on shore; that he had been very little cared for\\nat any time by his family, though quite as much as he deserved;\\nseldom heard of, and scarcely at all regretted, when the intelligence\\nof his death abroad had worked its way to uppercross, two years before.\\n\\nhe had, in fact, though his sisters were now doing all they could for him,\\nby calling him \"poor richard,\" been nothing better than a thick-headed,\\nunfeeling, unprofitable dick musgrove, who had never done anything\\nto entitle himself to more than the abbreviation of his name,\\nliving or dead.\\n\\nhe had been several years at sea, and had, in the course of those removals\\nto which all midshipmen are liable, and especially such midshipmen\\nas every captain wishes to get rid of, been six months on board\\ncaptain frederick wentworth\\'s frigate, the laconia; and from the laconia\\nhe had, under the influence of his captain, written the only two letters\\nwhich his father and mother had ever received from him during the whole\\nof his absence; that is to say, the only two disinterested letters;\\nall the rest had been mere applications for money.\\n\\nin each letter he had spoken well of his captain; but yet,\\nso little were they in the habit of attending to such matters,\\nso unobservant and incurious were they as to the names of men or ships,\\nthat it had made scarcely any impression at the time; and that mrs musgrove\\nshould have been suddenly struck, this very day, with a recollection\\nof the name of wentworth, as connected with her son, seemed one of those\\nextraordinary bursts of mind which do sometimes occur.\\n\\nshe had gone to her letters, and found it all as she supposed;\\nand the re-perusal of these letters, after so long an interval,\\nher poor son gone for ever, and all the strength of his faults forgotten,\\nhad affected her spirits exceedingly, and thrown her into\\ngreater grief for him than she had know on first hearing of his death.\\nmr musgrove was, in a lesser degree, affected likewise; and when\\nthey reached the cottage, they were evidently in want, first,\\nof being listened to anew on this subject, and afterwards,\\nof all the relief which cheerful companions could give them.\\n\\nto hear them talking so much of captain wentworth, repeating his name\\nso often, puzzling over past years, and at last ascertaining that it might,\\nthat it probably would, turn out to be the very same captain wentworth\\nwhom they recollected meeting, once or twice, after their coming back\\nfrom clifton--a very fine young man--but they could not say whether\\nit was seven or eight years ago, was a new sort of trial to anne\\'s nerves.\\nshe found, however, that it was one to which she must inure herself.\\nsince he actually was expected in the country, she must teach herself\\nto be insensible on such points.  and not only did it appear that\\nhe was expected, and speedily, but the musgroves, in their warm gratitude\\nfor the kindness he had shewn poor dick, and very high respect\\nfor his character, stamped as it was by poor dick\\'s having been\\nsix months under his care, and mentioning him in strong,\\nthough not perfectly well-spelt praise, as \"a fine dashing felow,\\nonly two perticular about the schoolmaster,\" were bent on\\nintroducing themselves, and seeking his acquaintance, as soon as\\nthey could hear of his arrival.\\n\\nthe resolution of doing so helped to form the comfort of their evening.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 7\\n\\n\\na very few days more, and captain wentworth was known to be at kellynch,\\nand mr musgrove had called on him, and come back warm in his praise,\\nand he was engaged with the crofts to dine at uppercross,\\nby the end of another week.  it had been a great disappointment\\nto mr musgrove to find that no earlier day could be fixed,\\nso impatient was he to shew his gratitude, by seeing captain wentworth\\nunder his own roof, and welcoming him to all that was strongest\\nand best in his cellars.  but a week must pass; only a week,\\nin anne\\'s reckoning, and then, she supposed, they must meet;\\nand soon she began to wish that she could feel secure even for a week.\\n\\ncaptain wentworth made a very early return to mr musgrove\\'s civility,\\nand she was all but calling there in the same half hour.\\nshe and mary were actually setting forward for the great house,\\nwhere, as she afterwards learnt, they must inevitably have found him,\\nwhen they were stopped by the eldest boy\\'s being at that moment\\nbrought home in consequence of a bad fall.  the child\\'s situation\\nput the visit entirely aside; but she could not hear of her escape\\nwith indifference, even in the midst of the serious anxiety\\nwhich they afterwards felt on his account.\\n\\nhis collar-bone was found to be dislocated, and such injury\\nreceived in the back, as roused the most alarming ideas.\\nit was an afternoon of distress, and anne had every thing to do at once;\\nthe apothecary to send for, the father to have pursued and informed,\\nthe mother to support and keep from hysterics, the servants to control,\\nthe youngest child to banish, and the poor suffering one to attend\\nand soothe; besides sending, as soon as she recollected it,\\nproper notice to the other house, which brought her an accession\\nrather of frightened, enquiring companions, than of very useful assistants.\\n\\nher brother\\'s return was the first comfort; he could take best care\\nof his wife; and the second blessing was the arrival of the apothecary.\\ntill he came and had examined the child, their apprehensions were\\nthe worse for being vague; they suspected great injury, but knew not where;\\nbut now the collar-bone was soon replaced, and though mr robinson\\nfelt and felt, and rubbed, and looked grave, and spoke low words\\nboth to the father and the aunt, still they were all to hope the best,\\nand to be able to part and eat their dinner in tolerable ease of mind;\\nand then it was, just before they parted, that the two young aunts\\nwere able so far to digress from their nephew\\'s state, as to give\\nthe information of captain wentworth\\'s visit; staying five minutes behind\\ntheir father and mother, to endeavour to express how perfectly delighted\\nthey were with him, how much handsomer, how infinitely more agreeable\\nthey thought him than any individual among their male acquaintance,\\nwho had been at all a favourite before.  how glad they had been\\nto hear papa invite him to stay dinner, how sorry when he said\\nit was quite out of his power, and how glad again when he had promised\\nin reply to papa and mamma\\'s farther pressing invitations to come\\nand dine with them on the morrow--actually on the morrow;\\nand he had promised it in so pleasant a manner, as if he felt\\nall the motive of their attention just as he ought.  and in short,\\nhe had looked and said everything with such exquisite grace,\\nthat they could assure them all, their heads were both turned by him;\\nand off they ran, quite as full of glee as of love, and apparently\\nmore full of captain wentworth than of little charles.\\n\\nthe same story and the same raptures were repeated, when the two girls came\\nwith their father, through the gloom of the evening, to make enquiries;\\nand mr musgrove, no longer under the first uneasiness about his heir,\\ncould add his confirmation and praise, and hope there would be now\\nno occasion for putting captain wentworth off, and only be sorry to think\\nthat the cottage party, probably, would not like to leave the little boy,\\nto give him the meeting.  \"oh no; as to leaving the little boy,\"\\nboth father and mother were in much too strong and recent alarm\\nto bear the thought; and anne, in the joy of the escape,\\ncould not help adding her warm protestations to theirs.\\n\\ncharles musgrove, indeed, afterwards, shewed more of inclination;\\n\"the child was going on so well, and he wished so much to be introduced\\nto captain wentworth, that, perhaps, he might join them in the evening;\\nhe would not dine from home, but he might walk in for half an hour.\"\\nbut in this he was eagerly opposed by his wife, with \"oh! no, indeed,\\ncharles, i cannot bear to have you go away.  only think if anything\\nshould happen?\"\\n\\nthe child had a good night, and was going on well the next day.\\nit must be a work of time to ascertain that no injury had been\\ndone to the spine; but mr robinson found nothing to increase alarm,\\nand charles musgrove began, consequently, to feel no necessity\\nfor longer confinement.  the child was to be kept in bed and amused\\nas quietly as possible; but what was there for a father to do?\\nthis was quite a female case, and it would be highly absurd in him,\\nwho could be of no use at home, to shut himself up.  his father\\nvery much wished him to meet captain wentworth, and there being\\nno sufficient reason against it, he ought to go; and it ended in his\\nmaking a bold, public declaration, when he came in from shooting,\\nof his meaning to dress directly, and dine at the other house.\\n\\n\"nothing can be going on better than the child,\" said he;\\n\"so i told my father, just now, that i would come, and he thought me\\nquite right.  your sister being with you, my love, i have no scruple at all.\\nyou would not like to leave him yourself, but you see i can be of no use.\\nanne will send for me if anything is the matter.\"\\n\\nhusbands and wives generally understand when opposition will be vain.\\nmary knew, from charles\\'s manner of speaking, that he was\\nquite determined on going, and that it would be of no use to teaze him.\\nshe said nothing, therefore, till he was out of the room,\\nbut as soon as there was only anne to hear--\\n\\n\"so you and i are to be left to shift by ourselves, with this\\npoor sick child; and not a creature coming near us all the evening!\\ni knew how it would be.  this is always my luck.  if there is\\nanything disagreeable going on men are always sure to get out of it,\\nand charles is as bad as any of them.  very unfeeling!  i must say\\nit is very unfeeling of him to be running away from his poor little boy.\\ntalks of his being going on so well!  how does he know that he is\\ngoing on well, or that there may not be a sudden change half an hour hence?\\ni did not think charles would have been so unfeeling.  so here he is to\\ngo away and enjoy himself, and because i am the poor mother,\\ni am not to be allowed to stir; and yet, i am sure, i am more unfit\\nthan anybody else to be about the child.  my being the mother\\nis the very reason why my feelings should not be tried.  i am not at all\\nequal to it.  you saw how hysterical i was yesterday.\"\\n\\n\"but that was only the effect of the suddenness of your alarm--\\nof the shock.  you will not be hysterical again.  i dare say we shall have\\nnothing to distress us.  i perfectly understand mr robinson\\'s directions,\\nand have no fears; and indeed, mary, i cannot wonder at your husband.\\nnursing does not belong to a man; it is not his province.\\na sick child is always the mother\\'s property:  her own feelings\\ngenerally make it so.\"\\n\\n\"i hope i am as fond of my child as any mother, but i do not know\\nthat i am of any more use in the sick-room than charles,\\nfor i cannot be always scolding and teazing the poor child when it is ill;\\nand you saw, this morning, that if i told him to keep quiet,\\nhe was sure to begin kicking about.  i have not nerves\\nfor the sort of thing.\"\\n\\n\"but, could you be comfortable yourself, to be spending\\nthe whole evening away from the poor boy?\"\\n\\n\"yes; you see his papa can, and why should not i?  jemima is so careful;\\nand she could send us word every hour how he was.  i really think\\ncharles might as well have told his father we would all come.\\ni am not more alarmed about little charles now than he is.\\ni was dreadfully alarmed yesterday, but the case is very different to-day.\"\\n\\n\"well, if you do not think it too late to give notice for yourself,\\nsuppose you were to go, as well as your husband.  leave little charles\\nto my care.  mr and mrs musgrove cannot think it wrong while i remain\\nwith him.\"\\n\\n\"are you serious?\" cried mary, her eyes brightening.  \"dear me!\\nthat\\'s a very good thought, very good, indeed.  to be sure,\\ni may just as well go as not, for i am of no use at home--am i?\\nand it only harasses me.  you, who have not a mother\\'s feelings,\\nare a great deal the properest person.  you can make little charles\\ndo anything; he always minds you at a word.  it will be a great deal better\\nthan leaving him only with jemima.  oh! i shall certainly go;\\ni am sure i ought if i can, quite as much as charles, for they want me\\nexcessively to be acquainted with captain wentworth, and i know\\nyou do not mind being left alone.  an excellent thought of yours,\\nindeed, anne.  i will go and tell charles, and get ready directly.\\nyou can send for us, you know, at a moment\\'s notice, if anything\\nis the matter; but i dare say there will be nothing to alarm you.\\ni should not go, you may be sure, if i did not feel quite at ease\\nabout my dear child.\"\\n\\nthe next moment she was tapping at her husband\\'s dressing-room door,\\nand as anne followed her up stairs, she was in time for\\nthe whole conversation, which began with mary\\'s saying,\\nin a tone of great exultation--\\n\\n\"i mean to go with you, charles, for i am of no more use at home\\nthan you are.  if i were to shut myself up for ever with the child,\\ni should not be able to persuade him to do anything he did not like.\\nanne will stay; anne undertakes to stay at home and take care of him.\\nit is anne\\'s own proposal, and so i shall go with you, which will be\\na great deal better, for i have not dined at the other house since tuesday.\"\\n\\n\"this is very kind of anne,\" was her husband\\'s answer, \"and i should be\\nvery glad to have you go; but it seems rather hard that she should be\\nleft at home by herself, to nurse our sick child.\"\\n\\nanne was now at hand to take up her own cause, and the sincerity\\nof her manner being soon sufficient to convince him, where conviction\\nwas at least very agreeable, he had no farther scruples as to her being\\nleft to dine alone, though he still wanted her to join them in the evening,\\nwhen the child might be at rest for the night, and kindly urged her\\nto let him come and fetch her, but she was quite unpersuadable;\\nand this being the case, she had ere long the pleasure of seeing them\\nset off together in high spirits.  they were gone, she hoped,\\nto be happy, however oddly constructed such happiness might seem;\\nas for herself, she was left with as many sensations of comfort,\\nas were, perhaps, ever likely to be hers.  she knew herself to be\\nof the first utility to the child; and what was it to her\\nif frederick wentworth were only half a mile distant, making himself\\nagreeable to others?\\n\\nshe would have liked to know how he felt as to a meeting.\\nperhaps indifferent, if indifference could exist under such circumstances.\\nhe must be either indifferent or unwilling.  had he wished\\never to see her again, he need not have waited till this time;\\nhe would have done what she could not but believe that in his place\\nshe should have done long ago, when events had been early giving him\\nthe independence which alone had been wanting.\\n\\nher brother and sister came back delighted with their new acquaintance,\\nand their visit in general.  there had been music, singing,\\ntalking, laughing, all that was most agreeable; charming manners\\nin captain wentworth, no shyness or reserve; they seemed all\\nto know each other perfectly, and he was coming the very next morning\\nto shoot with charles.  he was to come to breakfast, but not at the cottage,\\nthough that had been proposed at first; but then he had been pressed\\nto come to the great house instead, and he seemed afraid of being\\nin mrs charles musgrove\\'s way, on account of the child, and therefore,\\nsomehow, they hardly knew how, it ended in charles\\'s being to meet him\\nto breakfast at his father\\'s.\\n\\nanne understood it.  he wished to avoid seeing her.  he had inquired\\nafter her, she found, slightly, as might suit a former slight acquaintance,\\nseeming to acknowledge such as she had acknowledged, actuated, perhaps,\\nby the same view of escaping introduction when they were to meet.\\n\\nthe morning hours of the cottage were always later than those\\nof the other house, and on the morrow the difference was so great\\nthat mary and anne were not more than beginning breakfast when\\ncharles came in to say that they were just setting off, that he was\\ncome for his dogs, that his sisters were following with captain wentworth;\\nhis sisters meaning to visit mary and the child, and captain wentworth\\nproposing also to wait on her for a few minutes if not inconvenient;\\nand though charles had answered for the child\\'s being in no such state\\nas could make it inconvenient, captain wentworth would not be satisfied\\nwithout his running on to give notice.\\n\\nmary, very much gratified by this attention, was delighted to receive him,\\nwhile a thousand feelings rushed on anne, of which this was\\nthe most consoling, that it would soon be over.  and it was soon over.\\nin two minutes after charles\\'s preparation, the others appeared;\\nthey were in the drawing-room.  her eye half met captain wentworth\\'s,\\na bow, a curtsey passed; she heard his voice; he talked to mary,\\nsaid all that was right, said something to the miss musgroves,\\nenough to mark an easy footing; the room seemed full, full of persons\\nand voices, but a few minutes ended it.  charles shewed himself\\nat the window, all was ready, their visitor had bowed and was gone,\\nthe miss musgroves were gone too, suddenly resolving to walk\\nto the end of the village with the sportsmen:  the room was cleared,\\nand anne might finish her breakfast as she could.\\n\\n\"it is over! it is over!\" she repeated to herself again and again,\\nin nervous gratitude.  \"the worst is over!\"\\n\\nmary talked, but she could not attend.  she had seen him.\\nthey had met.  they had been once more in the same room.\\n\\nsoon, however, she began to reason with herself, and try to be feeling less.\\neight years, almost eight years had passed, since all had been given up.\\nhow absurd to be resuming the agitation which such an interval\\nhad banished into distance and indistinctness!  what might not\\neight years do?  events of every description, changes, alienations,\\nremovals--all, all must be comprised in it, and oblivion of the past--\\nhow natural, how certain too!  it included nearly a third part\\nof her own life.\\n\\nalas! with all her reasoning, she found, that to retentive feelings\\neight years may be little more than nothing.\\n\\nnow, how were his sentiments to be read?  was this like\\nwishing to avoid her?  and the next moment she was hating herself\\nfor the folly which asked the question.\\n\\non one other question which perhaps her utmost wisdom\\nmight not have prevented, she was soon spared all suspense;\\nfor, after the miss musgroves had returned and finished their visit\\nat the cottage she had this spontaneous information from mary: --\\n\\n\"captain wentworth is not very gallant by you, anne, though he was\\nso attentive to me.  henrietta asked him what he thought of you,\\nwhen they went away, and he said, `you were so altered he should not\\nhave known you again.\\'\"\\n\\nmary had no feelings to make her respect her sister\\'s in a common way,\\nbut she was perfectly unsuspicious of being inflicting any peculiar wound.\\n\\n\"altered beyond his knowledge.\"  anne fully submitted, in silent,\\ndeep mortification.  doubtless it was so, and she could take no revenge,\\nfor he was not altered, or not for the worse.  she had already\\nacknowledged it to herself, and she could not think differently,\\nlet him think of her as he would.  no:  the years which had destroyed\\nher youth and bloom had only given him a more glowing, manly,\\nopen look, in no respect lessening his personal advantages.\\nshe had seen the same frederick wentworth.\\n\\n\"so altered that he should not have known her again!\"  these were words\\nwhich could not but dwell with her.  yet she soon began to rejoice\\nthat she had heard them.  they were of sobering tendency;\\nthey allayed agitation; they composed, and consequently must\\nmake her happier.\\n\\nfrederick wentworth had used such words, or something like them,\\nbut without an idea that they would be carried round to her.\\nhe had thought her wretchedly altered, and in the first moment of appeal,\\nhad spoken as he felt.  he had not forgiven anne elliot.\\nshe had used him ill, deserted and disappointed him; and worse,\\nshe had shewn a feebleness of character in doing so, which his own decided,\\nconfident temper could not endure.  she had given him up to oblige others.\\nit had been the effect of over-persuasion.  it had been\\nweakness and timidity.\\n\\nhe had been most warmly attached to her, and had never seen a woman since\\nwhom he thought her equal; but, except from some natural sensation\\nof curiosity, he had no desire of meeting her again.  her power with him\\nwas gone for ever.\\n\\nit was now his object to marry.  he was rich, and being turned on shore,\\nfully intended to settle as soon as he could be properly tempted;\\nactually looking round, ready to fall in love with all the speed\\nwhich a clear head and a quick taste could allow.  he had a heart\\nfor either of the miss musgroves, if they could catch it; a heart,\\nin short, for any pleasing young woman who came in his way,\\nexcepting anne elliot.  this was his only secret exception,\\nwhen he said to his sister, in answer to her suppositions:--\\n\\n\"yes, here i am, sophia, quite ready to make a foolish match.\\nanybody between fifteen and thirty may have me for asking.\\na little beauty, and a few smiles, and a few compliments to the navy,\\nand i am a lost man.  should not this be enough for a sailor,\\nwho has had no society among women to make him nice?\"\\n\\nhe said it, she knew, to be contradicted.  his bright proud eye\\nspoke the conviction that he was nice; and anne elliot was\\nnot out of his thoughts, when he more seriously described\\nthe woman he should wish to meet with.  \"a strong mind,\\nwith sweetness of manner,\" made the first and the last of the description.\\n\\n\"that is the woman i want,\" said he.  \"something a little inferior\\ni shall of course put up with, but it must not be much.  if i am a fool,\\ni shall be a fool indeed, for i have thought on the subject\\nmore than most men.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 8\\n\\n\\nfrom this time captain wentworth and anne elliot were repeatedly\\nin the same circle.  they were soon dining in company together\\nat mr musgrove\\'s, for the little boy\\'s state could no longer\\nsupply his aunt with a pretence for absenting herself; and this was\\nbut the beginning of other dinings and other meetings.\\n\\nwhether former feelings were to be renewed must be brought to the proof;\\nformer times must undoubtedly be brought to the recollection of each;\\nthey could not but be reverted to; the year of their engagement\\ncould not but be named by him, in the little narratives or descriptions\\nwhich conversation called forth.  his profession qualified him,\\nhis disposition lead him, to talk; and \"that was in the year six;\"\\n\"that happened before i went to sea in the year six,\" occurred\\nin the course of the first evening they spent together:\\nand though his voice did not falter, and though she had no reason\\nto suppose his eye wandering towards her while he spoke,\\nanne felt the utter impossibility, from her knowledge of his mind,\\nthat he could be unvisited by remembrance any more than herself.\\nthere must be the same immediate association of thought,\\nthough she was very far from conceiving it to be of equal pain.\\n\\nthey had no conversation together, no intercourse but what\\nthe commonest civility required.  once so much to each other!\\nnow nothing!  there had been a time, when of all the large party\\nnow filling the drawing-room at uppercross, they would have found it\\nmost difficult to cease to speak to one another.  with the exception,\\nperhaps, of admiral and mrs croft, who seemed particularly attached\\nand happy, (anne could allow no other exceptions even among\\nthe married couples), there could have been no two hearts so open,\\nno tastes so similar, no feelings so in unison, no countenances so beloved.\\nnow they were as strangers; nay, worse than strangers, for they could\\nnever become acquainted.  it was a perpetual estrangement.\\n\\nwhen he talked, she heard the same voice, and discerned the same mind.\\nthere was a very general ignorance of all naval matters throughout the party;\\nand he was very much questioned, and especially by the two miss musgroves,\\nwho seemed hardly to have any eyes but for him, as to the manner\\nof living on board, daily regulations, food, hours, &c., and their surprise\\nat his accounts, at learning the degree of accommodation and arrangement\\nwhich was practicable, drew from him some pleasant ridicule,\\nwhich reminded anne of the early days when she too had been ignorant,\\nand she too had been accused of supposing sailors to be living on board\\nwithout anything to eat, or any cook to dress it if there were,\\nor any servant to wait, or any knife and fork to use.\\n\\nfrom thus listening and thinking, she was roused by a whisper\\nof mrs musgrove\\'s who, overcome by fond regrets, could not help saying--\\n\\n\"ah! miss anne, if it had pleased heaven to spare my poor son,\\ni dare say he would have been just such another by this time.\"\\n\\nanne suppressed a smile, and listened kindly, while mrs musgrove\\nrelieved her heart a little more; and for a few minutes, therefore,\\ncould not keep pace with the conversation of the others.\\n\\nwhen she could let her attention take its natural course again,\\nshe found the miss musgroves just fetching the navy list\\n(their own navy list, the first that had ever been at uppercross),\\nand sitting down together to pore over it, with the professed view\\nof finding out the ships that captain wentworth had commanded.\\n\\n\"your first was the asp, i remember; we will look for the asp.\"\\n\\n\"you will not find her there.  quite worn out and broken up.\\ni was the last man who commanded her.  hardly fit for service then.\\nreported fit for home service for a year or two, and so i was sent off\\nto the west indies.\"\\n\\nthe girls looked all amazement.\\n\\n\"the admiralty,\" he continued, \"entertain themselves now and then,\\nwith sending a few hundred men to sea, in a ship not fit to be employed.\\nbut they have a great many to provide for; and among the thousands\\nthat may just as well go to the bottom as not, it is impossible\\nfor them to distinguish the very set who may be least missed.\"\\n\\n\"phoo! phoo!\" cried the admiral, \"what stuff these young fellows talk!\\nnever was a better sloop than the asp in her day.  for an old built sloop,\\nyou would not see her equal.  lucky fellow to get her!  he knows there\\nmust have been twenty better men than himself applying for her\\nat the same time.  lucky fellow to get anything so soon,\\nwith no more interest than his.\"\\n\\n\"i felt my luck, admiral, i assure you;\" replied captain wentworth,\\nseriously.  \"i was as well satisfied with my appointment as you can desire.\\nit was a great object with me at that time to be at sea;\\na very great object, i wanted to be doing something.\"\\n\\n\"to be sure you did.  what should a young fellow like you do ashore\\nfor half a year together?  if a man had not a wife, he soon wants\\nto be afloat again.\"\\n\\n\"but, captain wentworth,\" cried louisa, \"how vexed you must have been\\nwhen you came to the asp, to see what an old thing they had given you.\"\\n\\n\"i knew pretty well what she was before that day;\" said he, smiling.\\n\"i had no more discoveries to make than you would have as to\\nthe fashion and strength of any old pelisse, which you had seen\\nlent about among half your acquaintance ever since you could remember,\\nand which at last, on some very wet day, is lent to yourself.\\nah! she was a dear old asp to me.  she did all that i wanted.\\ni knew she would.  i knew that we should either go to the bottom together,\\nor that she would be the making of me; and i never had two days\\nof foul weather all the time i was at sea in her; and after\\ntaking privateers enough to be very entertaining, i had the good luck\\nin my passage home the next autumn, to fall in with the very french frigate\\ni wanted.  i brought her into plymouth; and here another instance of luck.\\nwe had not been six hours in the sound, when a gale came on,\\nwhich lasted four days and nights, and which would have done for\\npoor old asp in half the time; our touch with the great nation\\nnot having much improved our condition.  four-and-twenty hours later,\\nand i should only have been a gallant captain wentworth,\\nin a small paragraph at one corner of the newspapers; and being lost\\nin only a sloop, nobody would have thought about me.\" anne\\'s shudderings\\nwere to herself alone; but the miss musgroves could be as open\\nas they were sincere, in their exclamations of pity and horror.\\n\\n\"and so then, i suppose,\" said mrs musgrove, in a low voice,\\nas if thinking aloud, \"so then he went away to the laconia, and there\\nhe met with our poor boy. charles, my dear,\" (beckoning him to her),\\n\"do ask captain wentworth where it was he first met with your poor brother.\\ni always forgot.\"\\n\\n\"it was at gibraltar, mother, i know.  dick had been left ill at gibraltar,\\nwith a recommendation from his former captain to captain wentworth.\"\\n\\n\"oh! but, charles, tell captain wentworth, he need not be afraid\\nof mentioning poor dick before me, for it would be rather a pleasure\\nto hear him talked of by such a good friend.\"\\n\\ncharles, being somewhat more mindful of the probabilities of the case,\\nonly nodded in reply, and walked away.\\n\\nthe girls were now hunting for the laconia; and captain wentworth\\ncould not deny himself the pleasure of taking the precious volume\\ninto his own hands to save them the trouble, and once more read aloud\\nthe little statement of her name and rate, and present\\nnon-commissioned class, observing over it that she too had been\\none of the best friends man ever had.\\n\\n\"ah! those were pleasant days when i had the laconia!  how fast i\\nmade money in her.  a friend of mine and i had such a lovely cruise\\ntogether off the western islands.  poor harville, sister!\\nyou know how much he wanted money:  worse than myself.  he had a wife.\\nexcellent fellow.  i shall never forget his happiness.  he felt it all,\\nso much for her sake.  i wished for him again the next summer,\\nwhen i had still the same luck in the mediterranean.\"\\n\\n\"and i am sure, sir.\" said mrs musgrove, \"it was a lucky day for us,\\nwhen you were put captain into that ship.  we shall never forget\\nwhat you did.\"\\n\\nher feelings made her speak low; and captain wentworth,\\nhearing only in part, and probably not having dick musgrove at all\\nnear his thoughts, looked rather in suspense, and as if waiting for more.\\n\\n\"my brother,\" whispered one of the girls; \"mamma is thinking\\nof poor richard.\"\\n\\n\"poor dear fellow!\" continued mrs musgrove; \"he was grown so steady,\\nand such an excellent correspondent, while he was under your care!\\nah! it would have been a happy thing, if he had never left you.\\ni assure you, captain wentworth, we are very sorry he ever left you.\"\\n\\nthere was a momentary expression in captain wentworth\\'s face at this speech,\\na certain glance of his bright eye, and curl of his handsome mouth,\\nwhich convinced anne, that instead of sharing in mrs musgrove\\'s kind wishes,\\nas to her son, he had probably been at some pains to get rid of him;\\nbut it was too transient an indulgence of self-amusement to be detected\\nby any who understood him less than herself; in another moment\\nhe was perfectly collected and serious, and almost instantly afterwards\\ncoming up to the sofa, on which she and mrs musgrove were sitting,\\ntook a place by the latter, and entered into conversation with her,\\nin a low voice, about her son, doing it with so much sympathy\\nand natural grace, as shewed the kindest consideration for all\\nthat was real and unabsurd in the parent\\'s feelings.\\n\\nthey were actually on the same sofa, for mrs musgrove had\\nmost readily made room for him; they were divided only by mrs musgrove.\\nit was no insignificant barrier, indeed.  mrs musgrove was of\\na comfortable, substantial size, infinitely more fitted by nature\\nto express good cheer and good humour, than tenderness and sentiment;\\nand while the agitations of anne\\'s slender form, and pensive face,\\nmay be considered as very completely screened, captain wentworth\\nshould be allowed some credit for the self-command with which\\nhe attended to her large fat sighings over the destiny of a son,\\nwhom alive nobody had cared for.\\n\\npersonal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary proportions.\\na large bulky figure has as good a right to be in deep affliction,\\nas the most graceful set of limbs in the world.  but, fair or not fair,\\nthere are unbecoming conjunctions, which reason will patronize in vain--\\nwhich taste cannot tolerate--which ridicule will seize.\\n\\nthe admiral, after taking two or three refreshing turns about the room\\nwith his hands behind him, being called to order by his wife,\\nnow came up to captain wentworth, and without any observation\\nof what he might be interrupting, thinking only of his own thoughts,\\nbegan with--\\n\\n\"if you had been a week later at lisbon, last spring, frederick,\\nyou would have been asked to give a passage to lady mary grierson\\nand her daughters.\"\\n\\n\"should i?  i am glad i was not a week later then.\"\\n\\nthe admiral abused him for his want of gallantry.  he defended himself;\\nthough professing that he would never willingly admit any ladies\\non board a ship of his, excepting for a ball, or a visit,\\nwhich a few hours might comprehend.\\n\\n\"but, if i know myself,\" said he, \"this is from no want of gallantry\\ntowards them.  it is rather from feeling how impossible it is,\\nwith all one\\'s efforts, and all one\\'s sacrifices, to make\\nthe accommodations on board such as women ought to have.\\nthere can be no want of gallantry, admiral, in rating the claims of women\\nto every personal comfort high, and this is what i do.  i hate to hear\\nof women on board, or to see them on board; and no ship under my command\\nshall ever convey a family of ladies anywhere, if i can help it.\"\\n\\nthis brought his sister upon him.\\n\\n\"oh! frederick!  but i cannot believe it of you. --all idle refinement!\\n--women may be as comfortable on board, as in the best house in england.\\ni believe i have lived as much on board as most women, and i know\\nnothing superior to the accommodations of a man-of-war.  i declare\\ni have not a comfort or an indulgence about me, even at kellynch hall,\"\\n(with a kind bow to anne), \"beyond what i always had in most of\\nthe ships i have lived in; and they have been five altogether.\"\\n\\n\"nothing to the purpose,\" replied her brother.  \"you were living\\nwith your husband, and were the only woman on board.\"\\n\\n\"but you, yourself, brought mrs harville, her sister, her cousin,\\nand three children, round from portsmouth to plymouth.  where was this\\nsuperfine, extraordinary sort of gallantry of yours then?\"\\n\\n\"all merged in my friendship, sophia.  i would assist any\\nbrother officer\\'s wife that i could, and i would bring anything\\nof harville\\'s from the world\\'s end, if he wanted it.  but do not imagine\\nthat i did not feel it an evil in itself.\"\\n\\n\"depend upon it, they were all perfectly comfortable.\"\\n\\n\"i might not like them the better for that perhaps.  such a number\\nof women and children have no right to be comfortable on board.\"\\n\\n\"my dear frederick, you are talking quite idly.  pray, what would\\nbecome of us poor sailors\\' wives, who often want to be conveyed to\\none port or another, after our husbands, if everybody had your feelings?\"\\n\\n\"my feelings, you see, did not prevent my taking mrs harville\\nand all her family to plymouth.\"\\n\\n\"but i hate to hear you talking so like a fine gentleman,\\nand as if women were all fine ladies, instead of rational creatures.\\nwe none of us expect to be in smooth water all our days.\"\\n\\n\"ah! my dear,\" said the admiral, \"when he had got a wife,\\nhe will sing a different tune.  when he is married, if we have\\nthe good luck to live to another war, we shall see him do as you and i,\\nand a great many others, have done.  we shall have him very thankful\\nto anybody that will bring him his wife.\"\\n\\n\"ay, that we shall.\"\\n\\n\"now i have done,\" cried captain wentworth.  \"when once married\\npeople begin to attack me with,--`oh! you will think very differently,\\nwhen you are married.\\'  i can only say, `no, i shall not;\\' and then\\nthey say again, `yes, you will,\\' and there is an end of it.\"\\n\\nhe got up and moved away.\\n\\n\"what a great traveller you must have been, ma\\'am!\" said mrs musgrove\\nto mrs croft.\\n\\n\"pretty well, ma\\'am in the fifteen years of my marriage;\\nthough many women have done more.  i have crossed the atlantic\\nfour times, and have been once to the east indies, and back again,\\nand only once; besides being in different places about home:\\ncork, and lisbon, and gibraltar.  but i never went beyond the streights,\\nand never was in the west indies.  we do not call bermuda or bahama,\\nyou know, the west indies.\"\\n\\nmrs musgrove had not a word to say in dissent; she could not accuse herself\\nof having ever called them anything in the whole course of her life.\\n\\n\"and i do assure you, ma\\'am,\" pursued mrs croft, \"that nothing can exceed\\nthe accommodations of a man-of-war; i speak, you know, of the higher rates.\\nwhen you come to a frigate, of course, you are more confined;\\nthough any reasonable woman may be perfectly happy in one of them;\\nand i can safely say, that the happiest part of my life has been spent\\non board a ship.  while we were together, you know, there was nothing\\nto be feared.  thank god!  i have always been blessed with\\nexcellent health, and no climate disagrees with me.  a little disordered\\nalways the first twenty-four hours of going to sea, but never knew\\nwhat sickness was afterwards.  the only time i ever really suffered\\nin body or mind, the only time that i ever fancied myself unwell,\\nor had any ideas of danger, was the winter that i passed by myself at deal,\\nwhen the admiral (captain croft then) was in the north seas.\\ni lived in perpetual fright at that time, and had all manner of\\nimaginary complaints from not knowing what to do with myself,\\nor when i should hear from him next; but as long as we could be together,\\nnothing ever ailed me, and i never met with the smallest inconvenience.\"\\n\\n\"aye, to be sure.  yes, indeed, oh yes!  i am quite of your opinion,\\nmrs croft,\" was mrs musgrove\\'s hearty answer.  \"there is nothing so bad\\nas a separation.  i am quite of your opinion.  i know what it is,\\nfor mr musgrove always attends the assizes, and i am so glad when\\nthey are over, and he is safe back again.\"\\n\\nthe evening ended with dancing.  on its being proposed,\\nanne offered her services, as usual; and though her eyes would sometimes\\nfill with tears as she sat at the instrument, she was extremely glad\\nto be employed, and desired nothing in return but to be unobserved.\\n\\nit was a merry, joyous party, and no one seemed in higher spirits\\nthan captain wentworth.  she felt that he had every thing to elevate\\nhim which general attention and deference, and especially the attention\\nof all the young women, could do.  the miss hayters, the females\\nof the family of cousins already mentioned, were apparently admitted\\nto the honour of being in love with him; and as for henrietta and louisa,\\nthey both seemed so entirely occupied by him, that nothing but\\nthe continued appearance of the most perfect good-will between themselves\\ncould have made it credible that they were not decided rivals.\\nif he were a little spoilt by such universal, such eager admiration,\\nwho could wonder?\\n\\nthese were some of the thoughts which occupied anne, while her fingers\\nwere mechanically at work, proceeding for half an hour together,\\nequally without error, and without consciousness.  once she felt\\nthat he was looking at herself,  observing her altered features,\\nperhaps, trying to trace in them the ruins of the face which had once\\ncharmed him; and once she knew that he must have spoken of her;\\nshe was hardly aware of it, till she heard the answer; but then she was\\nsure of his having asked his partner whether miss elliot never danced?\\nthe answer was, \"oh, no; never; she has quite given up dancing.\\nshe had rather play.  she is never tired of playing.\"  once, too,\\nhe spoke to her.  she had left the instrument on the dancing being over,\\nand he had sat down to try to make out an air which he wished\\nto give the miss musgroves an idea of.  unintentionally she returned\\nto that part of the room; he saw her, and, instantly rising,\\nsaid, with studied politeness--\\n\\n\"i beg your pardon, madam, this is your seat;\" and though she immediately\\ndrew back with a decided negative, he was not to be induced\\nto sit down again.\\n\\nanne did not wish for more of such looks and speeches.\\nhis cold politeness, his ceremonious grace, were worse than anything.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 9\\n\\n\\ncaptain wentworth was come to kellynch as to a home, to stay\\nas long as he liked, being as thoroughly the object of\\nthe admiral\\'s fraternal kindness as of his wife\\'s.  he had intended,\\non first arriving, to proceed very soon into shropshire,\\nand visit the brother settled in that country, but the attractions\\nof uppercross induced him to put this off.  there was so much\\nof friendliness, and of flattery, and of everything most bewitching\\nin his reception there; the old were so hospitable, the young so agreeable,\\nthat he could not but resolve to remain where he was, and take all\\nthe charms and perfections of edward\\'s wife upon credit a little longer.\\n\\nit was soon uppercross with him almost every day.  the musgroves\\ncould hardly be more ready to invite than he to come, particularly\\nin the morning, when he had no companion at home, for the admiral\\nand mrs croft were generally out of doors together, interesting themselves\\nin their new possessions, their grass, and their sheep, and dawdling about\\nin a way not endurable to a third person, or driving out in a gig,\\nlately added to their establishment.\\n\\nhitherto there had been but one opinion of captain wentworth\\namong the musgroves and their dependencies.  it was unvarying,\\nwarm admiration everywhere; but this intimate footing was not more\\nthan established, when a certain charles hayter returned among them,\\nto be a good deal disturbed by it, and to think captain wentworth\\nvery much in the way.\\n\\ncharles hayter was the eldest of all the cousins, and a very amiable,\\npleasing young man, between whom and henrietta there had been\\na considerable appearance of attachment previous to captain wentworth\\'s\\nintroduction.  he was in orders; and having a curacy in the neighbourhood,\\nwhere residence was not required, lived at his father\\'s house,\\nonly two miles from uppercross.  a short absence from home\\nhad left his fair one unguarded by his attentions at this critical period,\\nand when he came back he had the pain of finding very altered manners,\\nand of seeing captain wentworth.\\n\\nmrs musgrove and mrs hayter were sisters.  they had each had money,\\nbut their marriages had made a material difference in\\ntheir degree of consequence.  mr hayter had some property of his own,\\nbut it was insignificant compared with mr musgrove\\'s; and while\\nthe musgroves were in the first class of society in the country,\\nthe young hayters would, from their parents\\' inferior, retired,\\nand unpolished way of living, and their own defective education,\\nhave been hardly in any class at all, but for their connexion\\nwith uppercross, this eldest son of course excepted, who had chosen\\nto be a scholar and a gentleman, and who was very superior\\nin cultivation and manners to all the rest.\\n\\nthe two families had always been on excellent terms, there being no pride\\non one side, and no envy on the other, and only such a consciousness\\nof superiority in the miss musgroves, as made them pleased\\nto improve their cousins.  charles\\'s attentions to henrietta\\nhad been observed by her father and mother without any disapprobation.\\n\"it would not be a great match for her; but if henrietta liked him,\"--\\nand henrietta did seem to like him.\\n\\nhenrietta fully thought so herself, before captain wentworth came;\\nbut from that time cousin charles had been very much forgotten.\\n\\nwhich of the two sisters was preferred by captain wentworth was\\nas yet quite doubtful, as far as anne\\'s observation reached.\\nhenrietta was perhaps the prettiest, louisa had the higher spirits;\\nand she knew not now, whether the more gentle or the more lively character\\nwere most likely to attract him.\\n\\nmr and mrs musgrove, either from seeing little, or from\\nan entire confidence in the discretion of both their daughters,\\nand of all the young men who came near them, seemed to leave everything\\nto take its chance.  there was not the smallest appearance of solicitude\\nor remark about them in the mansion-house; but it was different\\nat the cottage:  the young couple there were more disposed\\nto speculate and wonder; and captain wentworth had not been above\\nfour or five times in the miss musgroves\\' company, and charles hayter\\nhad but just reappeared, when anne had to listen to the opinions\\nof her brother and sister, as to which was the one liked best.\\ncharles gave it for louisa, mary for henrietta, but quite agreeing\\nthat to have him marry either could be extremely delightful.\\n\\ncharles \"had never seen a pleasanter man in his life; and from what\\nhe had once heard captain wentworth himself say, was very sure that\\nhe had not made less than twenty thousand pounds by the war.\\nhere was a fortune at once; besides which, there would be the chance\\nof what might be done in any future war; and he was sure captain wentworth\\nwas as likely a man to distinguish himself as any officer in the navy.\\noh! it would be a capital match for either of his sisters.\"\\n\\n\"upon my word it would,\" replied mary.  \"dear me!  if he should\\nrise to any very great honours!  if he should ever be made a baronet!\\n`lady wentworth\\' sounds very well.  that would be a noble thing,\\nindeed, for henrietta!  she would take place of me then, and henrietta\\nwould not dislike that.  sir frederick and lady wentworth!\\nit would be but a new creation, however, and i never think much\\nof your new creations.\"\\n\\nit suited mary best to think henrietta the one preferred\\non the very account of charles hayter, whose pretensions she wished\\nto see put an end to.  she looked down very decidedly upon the hayters,\\nand thought it would be quite a misfortune to have the existing connection\\nbetween the families renewed--very sad for herself and her children.\\n\\n\"you know,\" said she, \"i cannot think him at all a fit match for henrietta;\\nand considering the alliances which the musgroves have made,\\nshe has no right to throw herself away.  i do not think any young woman\\nhas a right to make a choice that may be disagreeable and inconvenient\\nto the principal part of her family, and be giving bad connections\\nto those who have not been used to them.  and, pray, who is charles hayter?\\nnothing but a country curate.  a most improper match for miss musgrove\\nof uppercross.\"\\n\\nher husband, however, would not agree with her here; for besides having\\na regard for his cousin, charles hayter was an eldest son,\\nand he saw things as an eldest son himself.\\n\\n\"now you are taking nonsense, mary,\" was therefore his answer.\\n\"it would not be a great match for henrietta, but charles has\\na very fair chance, through the spicers, of getting something from\\nthe bishop in the course of a year or two; and you will please to remember,\\nthat he is the eldest son; whenever my uncle dies, he steps into very\\npretty property.  the estate at winthrop is not less than\\ntwo hundred and fifty acres, besides the farm near taunton,\\nwhich is some of the best land in the country.  i grant you,\\nthat any of them but charles would be a very shocking match for henrietta,\\nand indeed it could not be; he is the only one that could be possible;\\nbut he is a very good-natured, good sort of a fellow; and whenever winthrop\\ncomes into his hands, he will make a different sort of place of it,\\nand live in a very different sort of way; and with that property,\\nhe will never be a contemptible man--good, freehold property.  no, no;\\nhenrietta might do worse than marry charles hayter; and if she has him,\\nand louisa can get captain wentworth, i shall be very well satisfied.\"\\n\\n\"charles may say what he pleases,\" cried mary to anne, as soon as\\nhe was out of the room, \"but it would be shocking to have henrietta\\nmarry charles hayter; a very bad thing for her, and still worse\\nfor me; and therefore it is very much to be wished that captain wentworth\\nmay soon put him quite out of her head, and i have very little doubt\\nthat he has.  she took hardly any notice of charles hayter yesterday.\\ni wish you had been there to see her behaviour.  and as to\\ncaptain wentworth\\'s liking louisa as well as henrietta, it is nonsense\\nto say so; for he certainly does like henrietta a great deal the best.\\nbut charles is so positive!  i wish you had been with us yesterday,\\nfor then you might have decided between us; and i am sure you\\nwould have thought as i did, unless you had been determined\\nto give it against me.\"\\n\\na dinner at mr musgrove\\'s had been the occasion when all these things\\nshould have been seen by anne; but she had staid at home,\\nunder the mixed plea of a headache of her own, and some return\\nof indisposition in little charles.  she had thought only of avoiding\\ncaptain wentworth; but an escape from being appealed to as umpire\\nwas now added to the advantages of a quiet evening.\\n\\nas to captain wentworth\\'s views, she deemed it of more consequence\\nthat he should know his own mind early enough not to be endangering\\nthe happiness of either sister, or impeaching his own honour,\\nthan that he should prefer henrietta to louisa, or louisa to henrietta.\\neither of them would, in all probability, make him an affectionate,\\ngood-humoured wife.  with regard to charles hayter, she had delicacy\\nwhich must be pained by any lightness of conduct in a well-meaning\\nyoung woman, and a heart to sympathize in any of the sufferings\\nit occasioned; but if henrietta found herself mistaken in the nature\\nof her feelings, the alternation could not be understood too soon.\\n\\ncharles hayter had met with much to disquiet and mortify him\\nin his cousin\\'s behaviour.  she had too old a regard for him\\nto be so wholly estranged as might in two meetings extinguish\\nevery past hope, and leave him nothing to do but to keep away\\nfrom uppercross:  but there was such a change as became very alarming,\\nwhen such a man as captain wentworth was to be regarded as\\nthe probable cause.  he had been absent only two sundays,\\nand when they parted, had left her interested, even to the height\\nof his wishes, in his prospect of soon quitting his present curacy,\\nand obtaining that of uppercross instead.  it had then seemed the object\\nnearest her heart, that dr shirley, the rector, who for more than\\nforty years had been zealously discharging all the duties of his office,\\nbut was now growing too infirm for many of them, should be quite fixed\\non engaging a curate; should make his curacy quite as good\\nas he could afford, and should give charles hayter the promise of it.\\nthe advantage of his having to come only to uppercross, instead of going\\nsix miles another way; of his having, in every respect, a better curacy;\\nof his belonging to their dear dr shirley, and of dear, good dr shirley\\'s\\nbeing relieved from the duty which he could no longer get through\\nwithout most injurious fatigue, had been a great deal, even to louisa,\\nbut had been almost everything to henrietta.  when he came back, alas!\\nthe zeal of the business was gone by.  louisa could not listen at all\\nto his account of a conversation which he had just held with dr shirley:\\nshe was at a window, looking out for captain wentworth; and even henrietta\\nhad at best only a divided attention to give, and seemed to have forgotten\\nall the former doubt and solicitude of the negotiation.\\n\\n\"well, i am very glad indeed:  but i always thought you would have it;\\ni always thought you sure.  it did not appear to me that--in short,\\nyou know, dr shirley must have a curate, and you had secured his promise.\\nis he coming, louisa?\"\\n\\none morning, very soon after the dinner at the musgroves,\\nat which anne had not been present, captain wentworth walked into\\nthe drawing-room at the cottage, where were only herself and the little\\ninvalid charles, who was lying on the sofa.\\n\\nthe surprise of finding himself almost alone with anne elliot,\\ndeprived his manners of their usual composure:  he started,\\nand could only say, \"i thought the miss musgroves had been here:\\nmrs musgrove told me i should find them here,\" before he walked\\nto the window to recollect himself, and feel how he ought to behave.\\n\\n\"they are up stairs with my sister:  they will be down in a few moments,\\ni dare say,\" had been anne\\'s reply, in all the confusion that was natural;\\nand if the child had not called her to come and do something for him,\\nshe would have been out of the room the next moment, and released\\ncaptain wentworth as well as herself.\\n\\nhe continued at the window; and after calmly and politely saying,\\n\"i hope the little boy is better,\" was silent.\\n\\nshe was obliged to kneel down by the sofa, and remain there\\nto satisfy her patient; and thus they continued a few minutes,\\nwhen, to her very great satisfaction, she heard some other person\\ncrossing the little vestibule.  she hoped, on turning her head,\\nto see the master of the house; but it proved to be one\\nmuch less calculated for making matters easy--charles hayter,\\nprobably not at all better pleased by the sight of captain wentworth\\nthan captain wentworth had been by the sight of anne.\\n\\nshe only attempted to say, \"how do you do?  will you not sit down?\\nthe others will be here presently.\"\\n\\ncaptain wentworth, however, came from his window, apparently\\nnot ill-disposed for conversation; but charles hayter soon put an end\\nto his attempts by seating himself near the table, and taking up\\nthe newspaper; and captain wentworth returned to his window.\\n\\nanother minute brought another addition.  the younger boy,\\na remarkable stout, forward child, of two years old, having got the door\\nopened for him by some one without, made his determined appearance\\namong them, and went straight to the sofa to see what was going on,\\nand put in his claim to anything good that might be giving away.\\n\\nthere being nothing to eat, he could only have some play;\\nand as his aunt would not let him tease his sick brother,\\nhe began to fasten himself upon her, as she knelt, in such a way that,\\nbusy as she was about charles, she could not shake him off.\\nshe spoke to him, ordered, entreated, and insisted in vain.\\nonce she did contrive to push him away, but the boy had\\nthe greater pleasure in getting upon her back again directly.\\n\\n\"walter,\" said she, \"get down this moment.  you are extremely troublesome.\\ni am very angry with you.\"\\n\\n\"walter,\" cried charles hayter, \"why do you not do as you are bid?\\ndo not you hear your aunt speak?  come to me, walter, come to\\ncousin charles.\"\\n\\nbut not a bit did walter stir.\\n\\nin another moment, however, she found herself in the state of\\nbeing released from him; some one was taking him from her,\\nthough he had bent down her head so much, that his little sturdy hands\\nwere unfastened from around her neck, and he was resolutely borne away,\\nbefore she knew that captain wentworth had done it.\\n\\nher sensations on the discovery made her perfectly speechless.\\nshe could not even thank him.  she could only hang over little charles,\\nwith most disordered feelings.  his kindness in stepping forward\\nto her relief, the manner, the silence in which it had passed,\\nthe little particulars of the circumstance, with the conviction soon\\nforced on her by the noise he was studiously making with the child,\\nthat he meant to avoid hearing her thanks, and rather sought\\nto testify that her conversation was the last of his wants,\\nproduced such a confusion of varying, but very painful agitation,\\nas she could not recover from, till enabled by the entrance of mary\\nand the miss musgroves to make over her little patient to their cares,\\nand leave the room.  she could not stay.  it might have been\\nan opportunity of watching the loves and jealousies of the four--\\nthey were now altogether; but she could stay for none of it.\\nit was evident that charles hayter was not well inclined towards\\ncaptain wentworth.  she had a strong impression of his having said,\\nin a vext tone of voice, after captain wentworth\\'s interference,\\n\"you ought to have minded me, walter; i told you not to teaze your aunt;\"\\nand could comprehend his regretting that captain wentworth should do\\nwhat he ought to have done himself.  but neither charles hayter\\'s feelings,\\nnor anybody\\'s feelings, could interest her, till she had a little better\\narranged her own.  she was ashamed of herself, quite ashamed\\nof being so nervous, so overcome by such a trifle; but so it was,\\nand it required a long application of solitude and reflection\\nto recover her.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 10\\n\\n\\nother opportunities of making her observations could not fail to occur.\\nanne had soon been in company with all the four together often enough\\nto have an opinion, though too wise to acknowledge as much at home,\\nwhere she knew it would have satisfied neither husband nor wife;\\nfor while she considered louisa to be rather the favourite,\\nshe could not but think, as far as she might dare to judge from memory\\nand experience, that captain wentworth was not in love with either.\\nthey were more in love with him; yet there it was not love.\\nit was a little fever of admiration; but it might, probably must,\\nend in love with some.  charles hayter seemed aware of being slighted,\\nand yet henrietta had sometimes the air of being divided between them.\\nanne longed for the power of representing to them all what they were about,\\nand of pointing out some of the evils they were exposing themselves to.\\nshe did not attribute guile to any.  it was the highest satisfaction\\nto her to believe captain wentworth not in the least aware\\nof the pain he was occasioning.  there was no triumph, no pitiful triumph\\nin his manner.  he had, probably, never heard, and never thought of\\nany claims of charles hayter.  he was only wrong in accepting\\nthe attentions (for accepting must be the word) of two young women at once.\\n\\nafter a short struggle, however, charles hayter seemed to quit the field.\\nthree days had passed without his coming once to uppercross;\\na most decided change.  he had even refused one regular invitation to dinner;\\nand having been found on the occasion by mr musgrove with some large books\\nbefore him, mr and mrs musgrove were sure all could not be right,\\nand talked, with grave faces, of his studying himself to death.\\nit was mary\\'s hope and belief that he had received a positive dismissal\\nfrom henrietta, and her husband lived under the constant dependence\\nof seeing him to-morrow.  anne could only feel that charles hayter\\nwas wise.\\n\\none morning, about this time charles musgrove and captain wentworth\\nbeing gone a-shooting together, as the sisters in the cottage\\nwere sitting quietly at work, they were visited at the window\\nby the sisters from the mansion-house.\\n\\nit was a very fine november day, and the miss musgroves came\\nthrough the little grounds, and stopped for no other purpose than to say,\\nthat they were going to take a long walk, and therefore concluded\\nmary could not like to go with them; and when mary immediately replied,\\nwith some jealousy at not being supposed a good walker, \"oh, yes,\\ni should like to join you very much, i am very fond of a long walk;\"\\nanne felt persuaded, by the looks of the two girls, that it was precisely\\nwhat they did not wish, and admired again the sort of necessity\\nwhich the family habits seemed to produce, of everything being\\nto be communicated, and everything being to be done together,\\nhowever undesired and inconvenient.  she tried to dissuade mary from going,\\nbut in vain; and that being the case, thought it best to accept\\nthe miss musgroves\\' much more cordial invitation to herself to go likewise,\\nas she might be useful in turning back with her sister, and lessening\\nthe interference in any plan of their own.\\n\\n\"i cannot imagine why they should suppose i should not like a long walk,\"\\nsaid mary, as she went up stairs.  \"everybody is always supposing\\nthat i am not a good walker; and yet they would not have been pleased,\\nif we had refused to join them.  when people come in this manner\\non purpose to ask us, how can one say no?\"\\n\\njust as they were setting off, the gentlemen returned.  they had taken out\\na young dog, who had spoilt their sport, and sent them back early.\\ntheir time and strength, and spirits, were, therefore, exactly ready\\nfor this walk, and they entered into it with pleasure.  could anne\\nhave foreseen such a junction, she would have staid at home; but,\\nfrom some feelings of interest and curiosity, she fancied now that it was\\ntoo late to retract, and the whole six set forward together\\nin the direction chosen by the miss musgroves, who evidently\\nconsidered the walk as under their guidance.\\n\\nanne\\'s object was, not to be in the way of anybody; and where\\nthe narrow paths across the fields made many separations necessary,\\nto keep with her brother and sister.  her pleasure in the walk\\nmust arise from the exercise and the day, from the view of\\nthe last smiles of the year upon the tawny leaves, and withered hedges,\\nand from repeating to herself some few of the thousand poetical\\ndescriptions extant of autumn, that season of peculiar and\\ninexhaustible influence on the mind of taste and tenderness,\\nthat season which had drawn from every poet, worthy of being read,\\nsome attempt at description, or some lines of feeling.\\nshe occupied her mind as much as possible in such like musings\\nand quotations; but it was not possible, that when within reach\\nof captain wentworth\\'s conversation with either of the miss musgroves,\\nshe should not try to hear it; yet she caught little very remarkable.\\nit was mere lively chat, such as any young persons, on an intimate footing,\\nmight fall into.  he was more engaged with louisa than with henrietta.\\nlouisa certainly put more forward for his notice than her sister.\\nthis distinction appeared to increase, and there was one speech\\nof louisa\\'s which struck her.  after one of the many praises of the day,\\nwhich were continually bursting forth, captain wentworth added: --\\n\\n\"what glorious weather for the admiral and my sister!  they meant to take\\na long drive this morning; perhaps we may hail them from\\nsome of these hills.  they talked of coming into this side of the country.\\ni wonder whereabouts they will upset to-day.  oh! it does happen\\nvery often, i assure you; but my sister makes nothing of it;\\nshe would as lieve be tossed out as not.\"\\n\\n\"ah! you make the most of it, i know,\" cried louisa, \"but if it were\\nreally so, i should do just the same in her place.  if i loved a man,\\nas she loves the admiral, i would always be with him, nothing should ever\\nseparate us, and i would rather be overturned by him, than driven safely\\nby anybody else.\"\\n\\nit was spoken with enthusiasm.\\n\\n\"had you?\" cried he, catching the same tone; \"i honour you!\"\\nand there was silence between them for a little while.\\n\\nanne could not immediately fall into a quotation again.  the sweet scenes\\nof autumn were for a while put by, unless some tender sonnet,\\nfraught with the apt analogy of the declining year, with declining\\nhappiness, and the images of youth and hope, and spring, all gone together,\\nblessed her memory.  she roused herself to say, as they struck by order\\ninto another path, \"is not this one of the ways to winthrop?\"\\nbut nobody heard, or, at least, nobody answered her.\\n\\nwinthrop, however, or its environs--for young men are, sometimes\\nto be met with, strolling about near home--was their destination;\\nand after another half mile of gradual ascent through large enclosures,\\nwhere the ploughs at work, and the fresh made path spoke the farmer\\ncounteracting the sweets of poetical despondence, and meaning\\nto have spring again, they gained the summit of the most considerable hill,\\nwhich parted uppercross and winthrop, and soon commanded a full view\\nof the latter, at the foot of the hill on the other side.\\n\\nwinthrop, without beauty and without dignity, was stretched before them\\nan indifferent house, standing low, and hemmed in by the barns and\\nbuildings of a farm-yard.\\n\\nmary exclaimed, \"bless me! here is winthrop.  i declare i had no idea!\\nwell now, i think we had better turn back; i am excessively tired.\"\\n\\nhenrietta, conscious and ashamed, and seeing no cousin charles\\nwalking along any path, or leaning against any gate, was ready\\nto do as mary wished; but \"no!\" said charles musgrove, and \"no, no!\"\\ncried louisa more eagerly, and taking her sister aside, seemed to be\\narguing the matter warmly.\\n\\ncharles, in the meanwhile, was very decidedly declaring his resolution\\nof calling on his aunt, now that he was so near; and very evidently,\\nthough more fearfully, trying to induce his wife to go too.\\nbut this was one of the points on which the lady shewed her strength;\\nand when he recommended the advantage of resting herself a quarter\\nof an hour at winthrop, as she felt so tired, she resolutely answered,\\n\"oh! no, indeed! walking up that hill again would do her more harm\\nthan any sitting down could do her good;\" and, in short,\\nher look and manner declared, that go she would not.\\n\\nafter a little succession of these sort of debates and consultations,\\nit was settled between charles and his two sisters, that he\\nand henrietta should just run down for a few minutes, to see their aunt\\nand cousins, while the rest of the party waited for them at the top\\nof the hill.  louisa seemed the principal arranger of the plan;\\nand, as she went a little way with them, down the hill, still talking\\nto henrietta, mary took the opportunity of looking scornfully around her,\\nand saying to captain wentworth--\\n\\n\"it is very unpleasant, having such connexions!  but, i assure you,\\ni have never been in the house above twice in my life.\"\\n\\nshe received no other answer, than an artificial, assenting smile,\\nfollowed by a contemptuous glance, as he turned away, which anne\\nperfectly knew the meaning of.\\n\\nthe brow of the hill, where they remained, was a cheerful spot:\\nlouisa returned; and mary, finding a comfortable seat for herself\\non the step of a stile, was very well satisfied so long as the others\\nall stood about her; but when louisa drew captain wentworth away,\\nto try for a gleaning of nuts in an adjoining hedge-row,\\nand they were gone by degrees quite out of sight and sound,\\nmary was happy no longer; she quarrelled with her own seat,\\nwas sure louisa had got a much better somewhere, and nothing could\\nprevent her from going to look for a better also.  she turned through\\nthe same gate, but could not see them.  anne found a nice seat\\nfor her, on a dry sunny bank, under the hedge-row, in which\\nshe had no doubt of their still being, in some spot or other.\\nmary sat down for a moment, but it would not do; she was sure louisa\\nhad found a better seat somewhere else, and she would go on\\ntill she overtook her.\\n\\nanne, really tired herself, was glad to sit down; and she very soon heard\\ncaptain wentworth and louisa in the hedge-row, behind her, as if\\nmaking their way back along the rough, wild sort of channel, down the\\ncentre.  they were speaking as they drew near.  louisa\\'s voice was\\nthe first distinguished.  she seemed to be in the middle of some\\neager speech.  what anne first heard was--\\n\\n\"and so, i made her go.  i could not bear that she should be frightened\\nfrom the visit by such nonsense.  what! would i be turned back from\\ndoing a thing that i had determined to do, and that i knew to be right,\\nby the airs and interference of such a person, or of any person i may say?\\nno, i have no idea of being so easily persuaded.  when i have\\nmade up my mind, i have made it; and henrietta seemed entirely\\nto have made up hers to call at winthrop to-day; and yet, she was as near\\ngiving it up, out of nonsensical complaisance!\"\\n\\n\"she would have turned back then, but for you?\"\\n\\n\"she would indeed.  i am almost ashamed to say it.\"\\n\\n\"happy for her, to have such a mind as yours at hand!  after the hints\\nyou gave just now, which did but confirm my own observations,\\nthe last time i was in company with him,  i need not affect\\nto have no comprehension of what is going on.  i see that more than\\na mere dutiful morning visit to your aunt was in question;\\nand woe betide him, and her too, when it comes to things of consequence,\\nwhen they are placed in circumstances requiring fortitude and\\nstrength of mind, if she have not resolution enough to resist\\nidle interference in such a trifle as this.  your sister is\\nan amiable creature; but yours is the character of decision and firmness,\\ni see.  if you value her conduct or happiness, infuse as much\\nof your own spirit into her as you can.  but this, no doubt,\\nyou have been always doing.  it is the worst evil of too yielding\\nand indecisive a character, that no influence over it can be depended on.\\nyou are never sure of a good impression being durable; everybody\\nmay sway it.  let those who would be happy be firm.  here is a nut,\"\\nsaid he, catching one down from an upper bough.  \"to exemplify:\\na beautiful glossy nut, which, blessed with original strength,\\nhas outlived all the storms of autumn.  not a puncture, not\\na weak spot anywhere.  this nut,\" he continued, with playful solemnity,\\n\"while so many of his brethren have fallen and been trodden under foot,\\nis still in possession of all the happiness that a hazel nut can be\\nsupposed capable of.\"  then returning to his former earnest tone--\\n\"my first wish for all whom i am interested in, is that they should be firm.\\nif louisa musgrove would be beautiful and happy in her november of life,\\nshe will cherish all her present powers of mind.\"\\n\\nhe had done, and was unanswered.  it would have surprised anne if louisa\\ncould have readily answered such a speech:  words of such interest,\\nspoken with such serious warmth!  she could imagine what louisa was feeling.\\nfor herself, she feared to move, lest she should be seen.\\nwhile she remained, a bush of low rambling holly protected her,\\nand they were moving on.  before they were beyond her hearing,\\nhowever, louisa spoke again.\\n\\n\"mary is good-natured enough in many respects,\" said she;\\n\"but she does sometimes provoke me excessively, by her nonsense\\nand pride--the elliot pride.  she has a great deal too much\\nof the elliot pride.  we do so wish that charles had married anne instead.\\ni suppose you know he wanted to marry anne?\"\\n\\nafter a moment\\'s pause, captain wentworth said--\\n\\n\"do you mean that she refused him?\"\\n\\n\"oh! yes; certainly.\"\\n\\n\"when did that happen?\"\\n\\n\"i do not exactly know, for henrietta and i were at school at the time;\\nbut i believe about a year before he married mary.  i wish she had\\naccepted him.  we should all have liked her a great deal better;\\nand papa and mamma always think it was her great friend\\nlady russell\\'s doing, that she did not.  they think charles\\nmight not be learned and bookish enough to please lady russell,\\nand that therefore, she persuaded anne to refuse him.\"\\n\\nthe sounds were retreating, and anne distinguished no more.\\nher own emotions still kept her fixed.  she had much to recover from,\\nbefore she could move.  the listener\\'s proverbial fate was\\nnot absolutely hers; she had heard no evil of herself, but she had heard\\na great deal of very painful import.  she saw how her own character\\nwas considered by captain wentworth, and there had been just that degree\\nof feeling and curiosity about her in his manner which must give her\\nextreme agitation.\\n\\nas soon as she could, she went after mary, and having found,\\nand walked back with her to their former station, by the stile,\\nfelt some comfort in their whole party being immediately afterwards\\ncollected, and once more in motion together.  her spirits wanted\\nthe solitude and silence which only numbers could give.\\n\\ncharles and henrietta returned, bringing, as may be conjectured,\\ncharles hayter with them.  the minutiae of the business anne\\ncould not attempt to understand; even captain wentworth did not seem\\nadmitted to perfect confidence here; but that there had been a withdrawing\\non the gentleman\\'s side, and a relenting on the lady\\'s, and that they\\nwere now very glad to be together again, did not admit a doubt.\\nhenrietta looked a little ashamed, but very well pleased;--\\ncharles hayter exceedingly happy:  and they were devoted to each other\\nalmost from the first instant of their all setting forward for uppercross.\\n\\neverything now marked out louisa for captain wentworth;\\nnothing could be plainer; and where many divisions were necessary,\\nor even where they were not, they walked side by side nearly as much\\nas the other two.  in a long strip of meadow land, where there was\\nample space for all, they were thus divided, forming three distinct parties;\\nand to that party of the three which boasted least animation,\\nand least complaisance, anne necessarily belonged.  she joined charles\\nand mary, and was tired enough to be very glad of charles\\'s other arm;\\nbut charles, though in very good humour with her, was out of temper\\nwith his wife.  mary had shewn herself disobliging to him,\\nand was now to reap the consequence, which consequence was\\nhis dropping her arm almost every moment to cut off the heads\\nof some nettles in the hedge with his switch; and when mary began\\nto complain of it, and lament her being ill-used, according to custom,\\nin being on the hedge side, while anne was never incommoded on the other,\\nhe dropped the arms of both to hunt after a weasel which he had\\na momentary glance of, and they could hardly get him along at all.\\n\\nthis long meadow bordered a lane, which their footpath, at the end of it\\nwas to cross, and when the party had all reached the gate of exit,\\nthe carriage advancing in the same direction, which had been\\nsome time heard, was just coming up, and proved to be admiral croft\\'s gig.\\nhe and his wife had taken their intended drive, and were returning home.\\nupon hearing how long a walk the young people had engaged in,\\nthey kindly offered a seat to any lady who might be particularly tired;\\nit would save her a full mile, and they were going through uppercross.\\nthe invitation was general, and generally declined.  the miss musgroves\\nwere not at all tired, and mary was either offended, by not being asked\\nbefore any of the others, or what louisa called the elliot pride\\ncould not endure to make a third in a one horse chaise.\\n\\nthe walking party had crossed the lane, and were surmounting an\\nopposite stile, and the admiral was putting his horse in motion again,\\nwhen captain wentworth cleared the hedge in a moment to say something\\nto his sister.  the something might be guessed by its effects.\\n\\n\"miss elliot, i am sure you are tired,\" cried mrs croft.\\n\"do let us have the pleasure of taking you home.  here is excellent room\\nfor three, i assure you.  if we were all like you, i believe we might\\nsit four.  you must, indeed, you must.\"\\n\\nanne was still in the lane; and though instinctively beginning to decline,\\nshe was not allowed to proceed.  the admiral\\'s kind urgency\\ncame in support of his wife\\'s; they would not be refused;\\nthey compressed themselves into the smallest possible space\\nto leave her a corner, and captain wentworth, without saying a word,\\nturned to her, and quietly obliged her to be assisted into the carriage.\\n\\nyes; he had done it.  she was in the carriage, and felt that he had\\nplaced her there, that his will and his hands had done it,\\nthat she owed it to his perception of her fatigue, and his resolution\\nto give her rest.  she was very much affected by the view of\\nhis disposition towards her, which all these things made apparent.\\nthis little circumstance seemed the completion of all that had gone before.\\nshe understood him.  he could not forgive her, but he could not\\nbe unfeeling.  though condemning her for the past, and considering it\\nwith high and unjust resentment, though perfectly careless of her,\\nand though becoming attached to another, still he could not see her suffer,\\nwithout the desire of giving her relief.  it was a remainder\\nof former sentiment; it was an impulse of pure, though unacknowledged\\nfriendship; it was a proof of his own warm and amiable heart,\\nwhich she could not contemplate without emotions so compounded\\nof pleasure and pain, that she knew not which prevailed.\\n\\nher answers to the kindness and the remarks of her companions\\nwere at first unconsciously given.  they had travelled half their way\\nalong the rough lane, before she was quite awake to what they said.\\nshe then found them talking of \"frederick.\"\\n\\n\"he certainly means to have one or other of those two girls, sophy,\"\\nsaid the admiral; \"but there is no saying which.  he has been\\nrunning after them, too, long enough, one would think, to make up his mind.\\nay, this comes of the peace.  if it were war now, he would have\\nsettled it long ago.  we sailors, miss elliot, cannot afford to make\\nlong courtships in time of war.  how many days was it, my dear,\\nbetween the first time of my seeing you and our sitting down together\\nin our lodgings at north yarmouth?\"\\n\\n\"we had better not talk about it, my dear,\" replied mrs croft, pleasantly;\\n\"for if miss elliot were to hear how soon we came to an understanding,\\nshe would never be persuaded that we could be happy together.\\ni had known you by character, however, long before.\"\\n\\n\"well, and i had heard of you as a very pretty girl, and what were we\\nto wait for besides?  i do not like having such things so long in hand.\\ni wish frederick would spread a little more canvass, and bring us home\\none of these young ladies to kellynch.  then there would always\\nbe company for them.  and very nice young ladies they both are;\\ni hardly know one from the other.\"\\n\\n\"very good humoured, unaffected girls, indeed,\" said mrs croft,\\nin a tone of calmer praise, such as made anne suspect that\\nher keener powers might not consider either of them as quite worthy\\nof her brother; \"and a very respectable family.  one could not be\\nconnected with better people.  my dear admiral, that post!\\nwe shall certainly take that post.\"\\n\\nbut by coolly giving the reins a better direction herself they happily\\npassed the danger; and by once afterwards judiciously putting out\\nher hand they neither fell into a rut, nor ran foul of a dung-cart;\\nand anne, with some amusement at their style of driving,\\nwhich she imagined no bad representation of the general guidance\\nof their affairs, found herself safely deposited by them at the cottage.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 11\\n\\n\\nthe time now approached for lady russell\\'s return:  the day was even fixed;\\nand anne, being engaged to join her as soon as she was resettled,\\nwas looking forward to an early removal to kellynch, and beginning\\nto think how her own comfort was likely to be affected by it.\\n\\nit would place her in the same village with captain wentworth,\\nwithin half a mile of him; they would have to frequent the same church,\\nand there must be intercourse between the two families.\\nthis was against her; but on the other hand, he spent so much of his time\\nat uppercross, that in removing thence she might be considered rather\\nas leaving him behind, than as going towards him; and, upon the whole,\\nshe believed she must, on this interesting question, be the gainer,\\nalmost as certainly as in her change of domestic society,\\nin leaving poor mary for lady russell.\\n\\nshe wished it might be possible for her to avoid ever seeing\\ncaptain wentworth at the hall:  those rooms had witnessed\\nformer meetings which would be brought too painfully before her;\\nbut she was yet more anxious for the possibility of lady russell and\\ncaptain wentworth never meeting anywhere.  they did not like each other,\\nand no renewal of acquaintance now could do any good; and were lady russell\\nto see them together, she might think that he had too much self-possession,\\nand she too little.\\n\\nthese points formed her chief solicitude in anticipating\\nher removal from uppercross, where she felt she had been stationed\\nquite long enough.  her usefulness to little charles would always\\ngive some sweetness to the memory of her two months\\' visit there,\\nbut he was gaining strength apace, and she had nothing else to stay for.\\n\\nthe conclusion of her visit, however, was diversified in a way\\nwhich she had not at all imagined.  captain wentworth, after being unseen\\nand unheard of at uppercross for two whole days, appeared again among them\\nto justify himself by a relation of what had kept him away.\\n\\na letter from his friend, captain harville, having found him out at last,\\nhad brought intelligence of captain harville\\'s being settled\\nwith his family at lyme for the winter; of their being therefore,\\nquite unknowingly, within twenty miles of each other.  captain harville\\nhad never been in good health since a severe wound which he received\\ntwo years before, and captain wentworth\\'s anxiety to see him\\nhad determined him to go immediately to lyme.  he had been there\\nfor four-and-twenty hours.  his acquittal was complete,\\nhis friendship warmly honoured, a lively interest excited for his friend,\\nand his description of the fine country about lyme so feelingly attended to\\nby the party, that an earnest desire to see lyme themselves,\\nand a project for going thither was the consequence.\\n\\nthe young people were all wild to see lyme.  captain wentworth talked\\nof going there again himself, it was only seventeen miles from uppercross;\\nthough november, the weather was by no means bad; and, in short,\\nlouisa, who was the most eager of the eager, having formed\\nthe resolution to go, and besides the pleasure of doing as she liked,\\nbeing now armed with the idea of merit in maintaining her own way,\\nbore down all the wishes of her father and mother for putting it off\\ntill summer; and to lyme they were to go--charles, mary, anne, henrietta,\\nlouisa, and captain wentworth.\\n\\nthe first heedless scheme had been to go in the morning and return at night;\\nbut to this mr musgrove, for the sake of his horses, would not consent;\\nand when it came to be rationally considered, a day in\\nthe middle of november would not leave much time for seeing a new place,\\nafter deducting seven hours, as the nature of the country required,\\nfor going and returning.  they were, consequently, to stay the night there,\\nand not to be expected back till the next day\\'s dinner.  this was felt\\nto be a considerable amendment; and though they all met at the great house\\nat rather an early breakfast hour, and set off very punctually,\\nit was so much past noon before the two carriages, mr musgrove\\'s coach\\ncontaining the four ladies, and charles\\'s curricle, in which\\nhe drove captain wentworth, were descending the long hill into lyme,\\nand entering upon the still steeper street of the town itself,\\nthat it was very evident they would not have more than time\\nfor looking about them, before the light and warmth of the day were gone.\\n\\nafter securing accommodations, and ordering a dinner at one of the inns,\\nthe next thing to be done was unquestionably to walk directly\\ndown to the sea.  they were come too late in the year for any amusement\\nor variety which lyme, as a public place, might offer.  the rooms\\nwere shut up, the lodgers almost all gone, scarcely any family\\nbut of the residents left; and, as there is nothing to admire\\nin the buildings themselves, the remarkable situation of the town,\\nthe principal street almost hurrying into the water, the walk to the cobb,\\nskirting round the pleasant little bay, which, in the season,\\nis animated with bathing machines and company; the cobb itself,\\nits old wonders and new improvements, with the very beautiful\\nline of cliffs stretching out to the east of the town, are what\\nthe stranger\\'s eye will seek; and a very strange stranger it must be,\\nwho does not see charms in the immediate environs of lyme,\\nto make him wish to know it better.  the scenes in its neighbourhood,\\ncharmouth, with its high grounds and extensive sweeps of country,\\nand still more, its sweet, retired bay, backed by dark cliffs,\\nwhere fragments of low rock among the sands, make it the happiest spot\\nfor watching the flow of the tide, for sitting in unwearied contemplation;\\nthe woody varieties of the cheerful village of up lyme; and, above all,\\npinny, with its green chasms between romantic rocks, where\\nthe scattered forest trees and orchards of luxuriant growth,\\ndeclare that many a generation must have passed away since the first\\npartial falling of the cliff prepared the ground for such a state,\\nwhere a scene so wonderful and so lovely is exhibited, as may\\nmore than equal any of the resembling scenes of the far-famed\\nisle of wight:  these places must be visited, and visited again,\\nto make the worth of lyme understood.\\n\\nthe party from uppercross passing down by the now deserted\\nand melancholy looking rooms, and still descending, soon found themselves\\non the sea-shore; and lingering only, as all must linger and gaze\\non a first return to the sea, who ever deserved to look on it at all,\\nproceeded towards the cobb, equally their object in itself\\nand on captain wentworth\\'s account:  for in a small house,\\nnear the foot of an old pier of unknown date, were the harvilles settled.\\ncaptain wentworth turned in to call on his friend; the others walked on,\\nand he was to join them on the cobb.\\n\\nthey were by no means tired of wondering and admiring; and not even louisa\\nseemed to feel that they had parted with captain wentworth long,\\nwhen they saw him coming after them, with three companions,\\nall well known already, by description, to be captain and mrs harville,\\nand a captain benwick, who was staying with them.\\n\\ncaptain benwick had some time ago been first lieutenant of the laconia;\\nand the account which captain wentworth had given of him,\\non his return from lyme before, his warm praise of him as\\nan excellent young man and an officer, whom he had always valued highly,\\nwhich must have stamped him well in the esteem of every listener,\\nhad been followed by a little history of his private life,\\nwhich rendered him perfectly interesting in the eyes of all the ladies.\\nhe had been engaged to captain harville\\'s sister, and was now\\nmourning her loss.  they had been a year or two waiting for fortune\\nand promotion.  fortune came, his prize-money as lieutenant being great;\\npromotion, too, came at last; but fanny harville did not live to know it.\\nshe had died the preceding summer while he was at sea.  captain wentworth\\nbelieved it impossible for man to be more attached to woman\\nthan poor benwick had been to fanny harville, or to be more deeply\\nafflicted under the dreadful change.  he considered his disposition\\nas of the sort which must suffer heavily, uniting very strong feelings\\nwith quiet, serious, and retiring manners, and a decided taste for reading,\\nand sedentary pursuits.  to finish the interest of the story,\\nthe friendship between him and the harvilles seemed, if possible,\\naugmented by the event which closed all their views of alliance,\\nand captain benwick was now living with them entirely.  captain harville\\nhad taken his present house for half a year; his taste, and his health,\\nand his fortune, all directing him to a residence inexpensive,\\nand by the sea; and the grandeur of the country, and the retirement\\nof lyme in the winter, appeared exactly adapted to captain benwick\\'s\\nstate of mind.  the sympathy and good-will excited towards captain benwick\\nwas very great.\\n\\n\"and yet,\" said anne to herself, as they now moved forward\\nto meet the party, \"he has not, perhaps, a more sorrowing heart\\nthan i have.  i cannot believe his prospects so blighted for ever.\\nhe is younger than i am; younger in feeling, if not in fact;\\nyounger as a man.  he will rally again, and be happy with another.\"\\n\\nthey all met, and were introduced.  captain harville was a tall,\\ndark man, with a sensible, benevolent countenance; a little lame;\\nand from strong features and want of health, looking much older\\nthan captain wentworth.  captain benwick looked, and was,\\nthe youngest of the three, and, compared with either of them,\\na little man.  he had a pleasing face and a melancholy air,\\njust as he ought to have, and drew back from conversation.\\n\\ncaptain harville, though not equalling captain wentworth in manners,\\nwas a perfect gentleman, unaffected, warm, and obliging.\\nmrs harville, a degree less polished than her husband, seemed, however,\\nto have the same good feelings; and nothing could be more pleasant\\nthan their desire of considering the whole party as friends of their own,\\nbecause the friends of captain wentworth, or more kindly hospitable\\nthan their entreaties for their all promising to dine with them.\\nthe dinner, already ordered at the inn, was at last, though unwillingly,\\naccepted as a excuse; but they seemed almost hurt that captain wentworth\\nshould have brought any such party to lyme, without considering it\\nas a thing of course that they should dine with them.\\n\\nthere was so much attachment to captain wentworth in all this,\\nand such a bewitching charm in a degree of hospitality so uncommon,\\nso unlike the usual style of give-and-take invitations, and dinners\\nof formality and display, that anne felt her spirits not likely to be\\nbenefited by an increasing acquaintance among his brother-officers.\\n\"these would have been all my friends,\" was her thought;\\nand she had to struggle against a great tendency to lowness.\\n\\non quitting the cobb, they all went in-doors with their new friends,\\nand found rooms so small as none but those who invite from the heart\\ncould think capable of accommodating so many.  anne had\\na moment\\'s astonishment on the subject herself; but it was soon lost\\nin the pleasanter feelings which sprang from the sight of all\\nthe ingenious contrivances and nice arrangements of captain harville,\\nto turn the actual space to the best account, to supply the deficiencies\\nof lodging-house furniture, and defend the windows and doors\\nagainst the winter storms to be expected.  the varieties in\\nthe fitting-up of the rooms, where the common necessaries\\nprovided by the owner, in the common indifferent plight,\\nwere contrasted with some few articles of a rare species of wood,\\nexcellently worked up, and with something curious and valuable\\nfrom all the distant countries captain harville had visited,\\nwere more than amusing to anne; connected as it all was with his profession,\\nthe fruit of its labours, the effect of its influence on his habits,\\nthe picture of repose and domestic happiness it presented,\\nmade it to her a something more, or less, than gratification.\\n\\ncaptain harville was no reader; but he had contrived\\nexcellent accommodations, and fashioned very pretty shelves,\\nfor a tolerable collection of well-bound volumes, the property of\\ncaptain benwick.  his lameness prevented him from taking much exercise;\\nbut a mind of usefulness and ingenuity seemed to furnish him with\\nconstant employment within.  he drew, he varnished, he carpentered,\\nhe glued; he made toys for the children; he fashioned new netting-needles\\nand pins with improvements; and if everything else was done,\\nsat down to his large fishing-net at one corner of the room.\\n\\nanne thought she left great happiness behind her when they\\nquitted the house; and louisa, by whom she found herself walking,\\nburst forth into raptures of admiration and delight on the character\\nof the navy; their friendliness, their brotherliness, their openness,\\ntheir uprightness; protesting that she was convinced of sailors having\\nmore worth and warmth than any other set of men in england;\\nthat they only knew how to live, and they only deserved to be\\nrespected and loved.\\n\\nthey went back to dress and dine; and so well had the scheme\\nanswered already, that nothing was found amiss; though its being\\n\"so entirely out of season,\" and the \"no thoroughfare of lyme,\"\\nand the \"no expectation of company,\" had brought many apologies\\nfrom the heads of the inn.\\n\\nanne found herself by this time growing so much more hardened\\nto being in captain wentworth\\'s company than she had at first imagined\\ncould ever be, that the sitting down to the same table with him now,\\nand the interchange of the common civilities attending on it\\n(they never got beyond), was become a mere nothing.\\n\\nthe nights were too dark for the ladies to meet again till the morrow,\\nbut captain harville had promised them a visit in the evening;\\nand he came, bringing his friend also, which was more than\\nhad been expected, it having been agreed that captain benwick\\nhad all the appearance of being oppressed by the presence of\\nso many strangers.  he ventured among them again, however,\\nthough his spirits certainly did not seem fit for the mirth\\nof the party in general.\\n\\nwhile captains wentworth and harville led the talk on one side of the room,\\nand by recurring to former days, supplied anecdotes in abundance\\nto occupy and entertain the others, it fell to anne\\'s lot to be placed\\nrather apart with captain benwick; and a very good impulse\\nof her nature obliged her to begin an acquaintance with him.\\nhe was shy, and disposed to abstraction; but the engaging mildness of\\nher countenance, and gentleness of her manners, soon had their effect;\\nand anne was well repaid the first trouble of exertion.\\nhe was evidently a young man of considerable taste in reading,\\nthough principally in poetry; and besides the persuasion of having\\ngiven him at least an evening\\'s indulgence in the discussion of subjects,\\nwhich his usual companions had probably no concern in, she had the hope\\nof being of real use to him in some suggestions as to the duty and\\nbenefit of struggling against affliction, which had naturally grown out\\nof their conversation.  for, though shy, he did not seem reserved;\\nit had rather the appearance of feelings glad to burst their\\nusual restraints; and having talked of poetry, the richness of\\nthe present age, and gone through a brief comparison of opinion\\nas to the first-rate poets, trying to ascertain whether marmion\\nor the lady of the lake were to be preferred, and how ranked the giaour\\nand the bride of abydos; and moreover, how the giaour was to be pronounced,\\nhe showed himself so intimately acquainted with all the tenderest songs\\nof the one poet, and all the impassioned descriptions of hopeless agony\\nof the other; he repeated, with such tremulous feeling, the various lines\\nwhich imaged a broken heart, or a mind destroyed by wretchedness,\\nand looked so entirely as if he meant to be understood,\\nthat she ventured to hope he did not always read only poetry,\\nand to say, that she thought it was the misfortune of poetry to be\\nseldom safely enjoyed by those who enjoyed it completely;\\nand that the strong feelings which alone could estimate it truly\\nwere the very feelings which ought to taste it but sparingly.\\n\\nhis looks shewing him not pained, but pleased with this allusion\\nto his situation, she was emboldened to go on; and feeling in herself\\nthe right of seniority of mind, she ventured to recommend\\na larger allowance of prose in his daily study; and on being requested\\nto particularize, mentioned such works of our best moralists,\\nsuch collections of the finest letters, such memoirs of characters\\nof worth and suffering, as occurred to her at the moment\\nas calculated to rouse and fortify the mind by the highest precepts,\\nand the strongest examples of moral and religious endurances.\\n\\ncaptain benwick listened attentively, and seemed grateful for\\nthe interest implied; and though with a shake of the head,\\nand sighs which declared his little faith in the efficacy of any books\\non grief like his, noted down the names of those she recommended,\\nand promised to procure and read them.\\n\\nwhen the evening was over, anne could not but be amused at the idea\\nof her coming to lyme to preach patience and resignation to a young man\\nwhom she had never seen before; nor could she help fearing,\\non more serious reflection, that, like many other great moralists\\nand preachers, she had been eloquent on a point in which her own conduct\\nwould ill bear examination.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 12\\n\\n\\nanne and henrietta, finding themselves the earliest of the party\\nthe next morning, agreed to stroll down to the sea before breakfast.\\nthey went to the sands, to watch the flowing of the tide,\\nwhich a fine south-easterly breeze was bringing in with all the grandeur\\nwhich so flat a shore admitted.  they praised the morning;\\ngloried in the sea; sympathized in the delight of the fresh-feeling\\nbreeze--and were silent; till henrietta suddenly began again with--\\n\\n\"oh! yes,--i am quite convinced that, with very few exceptions,\\nthe sea-air always does good.  there can be no doubt of its having been\\nof the greatest service to dr shirley, after his illness,\\nlast spring twelve-month.  he declares himself, that coming to lyme\\nfor a month, did him more good than all the medicine he took;\\nand, that being by the sea, always makes him feel young again.\\nnow, i cannot help thinking it a pity that he does not live\\nentirely by the sea.  i do think he had better leave uppercross entirely,\\nand fix at lyme.  do not you, anne?  do not you agree with me,\\nthat it is the best thing he could do, both for himself and mrs shirley?\\nshe has cousins here, you know, and many acquaintance, which would\\nmake it cheerful for her, and i am sure she would be glad\\nto get to a place where she could have medical attendance at hand,\\nin case of his having another seizure.  indeed i think it quite melancholy\\nto have such excellent people as dr and mrs shirley, who have been\\ndoing good all their lives, wearing out their last days in a place\\nlike uppercross, where, excepting our family, they seem shut out\\nfrom all the world.  i wish his friends would propose it to him.\\ni really think they ought.  and, as to procuring a dispensation,\\nthere could be no difficulty at his time of life, and with his character.\\nmy only doubt is, whether anything could persuade him to leave his parish.\\nhe is so very strict and scrupulous in his notions; over-scrupulous\\ni must say.  do not you think, anne, it is being over-scrupulous?\\ndo not you think it is quite a mistaken point of conscience,\\nwhen a clergyman sacrifices his health for the sake of duties,\\nwhich may be just as well performed by another person?  and at lyme too,\\nonly seventeen miles off, he would be near enough to hear,\\nif people thought there was anything to complain of.\"\\n\\nanne smiled more than once to herself during this speech,\\nand entered into the subject, as ready to do good by entering into\\nthe feelings of a young lady as of a young man, though here it was good\\nof a lower standard, for what could be offered but general acquiescence?\\nshe said all that was reasonable and proper on the business;\\nfelt the claims of dr shirley to repose as she ought; saw how very\\ndesirable it was that he should have some active, respectable young man,\\nas a resident curate, and was even courteous enough to hint at\\nthe advantage of such resident curate\\'s being married.\\n\\n\"i wish,\" said henrietta, very well pleased with her companion,\\n\"i wish lady russell lived at uppercross, and were intimate\\nwith dr shirley.  i have always heard of lady russell as a woman of\\nthe greatest influence with everybody!  i always look upon her as able\\nto persuade a person to anything!  i am afraid of her, as i have\\ntold you before, quite afraid of her, because she is so very clever;\\nbut i respect her amazingly, and wish we had such a neighbour\\nat uppercross.\"\\n\\nanne was amused by henrietta\\'s manner of being grateful,\\nand amused also that the course of events and the new interests\\nof henrietta\\'s views should have placed her friend at all in favour\\nwith any of the musgrove family; she had only time, however,\\nfor a general answer, and a wish that such another woman\\nwere at uppercross, before all subjects suddenly ceased,\\non seeing louisa and captain wentworth coming towards them.\\nthey came also for a stroll till breakfast was likely to be ready;\\nbut louisa recollecting, immediately afterwards that she had something\\nto procure at a shop, invited them all to go back with her into the town.\\nthey were all at her disposal.\\n\\nwhen they came to the steps, leading upwards from the beach, a gentleman,\\nat the same moment preparing to come down, politely drew back,\\nand stopped to give them way.  they ascended and passed him;\\nand as they passed, anne\\'s face caught his eye, and he looked at her\\nwith a degree of earnest admiration, which she could not be insensible of.\\nshe was looking remarkably well; her very regular, very pretty features,\\nhaving the bloom and freshness of youth restored by the fine wind\\nwhich had been blowing on her complexion, and by the animation of eye\\nwhich it had also produced.  it was evident that the gentleman,\\n(completely a gentleman in manner) admired her exceedingly.\\ncaptain wentworth looked round at her instantly in a way which\\nshewed his noticing of it.  he gave her a momentary glance,\\na glance of brightness, which seemed to say, \"that man is struck with you,\\nand even i, at this moment, see something like anne elliot again.\"\\n\\nafter attending louisa through her business, and loitering about\\na little longer, they returned to the inn; and anne, in passing afterwards\\nquickly from her own chamber to their dining-room, had nearly run against\\nthe very same gentleman, as he came out of an adjoining apartment.\\nshe had before conjectured him to be a stranger like themselves,\\nand determined that a well-looking groom, who was strolling about\\nnear the two inns as they came back, should be his servant.\\nboth master and man being in mourning assisted the idea.\\nit was now proved that he belonged to the same inn as themselves;\\nand this second meeting, short as it was, also proved again\\nby the gentleman\\'s looks, that he thought hers very lovely,\\nand by the readiness and propriety of his apologies, that he was\\na man of exceedingly good manners.  he seemed about thirty,\\nand though not handsome, had an agreeable person.  anne felt that\\nshe should like to know who he was.\\n\\nthey had nearly done breakfast, when the sound of a carriage,\\n(almost the first they had heard since entering lyme) drew half the party\\nto the window.  it was a gentleman\\'s carriage, a curricle,\\nbut only coming round from the stable-yard to the front door;\\nsomebody must be going away.  it was driven by a servant in mourning.\\n\\nthe word curricle made charles musgrove jump up that he might\\ncompare it with his own; the servant in mourning roused anne\\'s curiosity,\\nand the whole six were collected to look, by the time the owner\\nof the curricle was to be seen issuing from the door amidst the bows\\nand civilities of the household, and taking his seat, to drive off.\\n\\n\"ah!\" cried captain wentworth, instantly, and with half a glance at anne,\\n\"it is the very man we passed.\"\\n\\nthe miss musgroves agreed to it; and having all kindly watched him\\nas far up the hill as they could, they returned to the breakfast table.\\nthe waiter came into the room soon afterwards.\\n\\n\"pray,\" said captain wentworth, immediately, \"can you tell us the name\\nof the gentleman who is just gone away?\"\\n\\n\"yes, sir, a mr elliot, a gentleman of large fortune, came in last night\\nfrom sidmouth.  dare say you heard the carriage, sir, while you were\\nat dinner; and going on now for crewkherne, in his way to bath\\nand london.\"\\n\\n\"elliot!\"  many had looked on each other, and many had repeated the name,\\nbefore all this had been got through, even by the smart rapidity\\nof a waiter.\\n\\n\"bless me!\" cried mary; \"it must be our cousin; it must be our mr elliot,\\nit must, indeed!  charles, anne, must not it?  in mourning, you see,\\njust as our mr elliot must be.  how very extraordinary!\\nin the very same inn with us!  anne, must not it be our mr elliot?\\nmy father\\'s next heir?  pray sir,\" turning to the waiter,\\n\"did not you hear, did not his servant say whether he belonged\\nto the kellynch family?\"\\n\\n\"no, ma\\'am, he did not mention no particular family; but he said\\nhis master was a very rich gentleman, and would be a baronight some day.\"\\n\\n\"there! you see!\" cried mary in an ecstasy, \"just as i said!\\nheir to sir walter elliot!  i was sure that would come out,\\nif it was so.  depend upon it, that is a circumstance which his servants\\ntake care to publish, wherever he goes.  but, anne, only conceive\\nhow extraordinary!  i wish i had looked at him more.  i wish we had\\nbeen aware in time, who it was, that he might have been introduced to us.\\nwhat a pity that we should not have been introduced to each other!\\ndo you think he had the elliot countenance?  i hardly looked at him,\\ni was looking at the horses; but i think he had something\\nof the elliot countenance, i wonder the arms did not strike me!\\noh! the great-coat was hanging over the panel, and hid the arms,\\nso it did; otherwise, i am sure, i should have observed them,\\nand the livery too; if the servant had not been in mourning,\\none should have known him by the livery.\"\\n\\n\"putting all these very extraordinary circumstances together,\"\\nsaid captain wentworth, \"we must consider it to be the arrangement\\nof providence, that you should not be introduced to your cousin.\"\\n\\nwhen she could command mary\\'s attention, anne quietly tried\\nto convince her that their father and mr elliot had not, for many years,\\nbeen on such terms as to make the power of attempting an introduction\\nat all desirable.\\n\\nat the same time, however, it was a secret gratification to herself\\nto have seen her cousin, and to know that the future owner of kellynch\\nwas undoubtedly a gentleman, and had an air of good sense.\\nshe would not, upon any account, mention her having met with him\\nthe second time; luckily mary did not much attend to their having\\npassed close by him in their earlier walk, but she would have felt\\nquite ill-used by anne\\'s having actually run against him in the passage,\\nand received his very polite excuses, while she had never been\\nnear him at all; no, that cousinly little interview must remain\\na perfect secret.\\n\\n\"of course,\" said mary, \"you will mention our seeing mr elliot,\\nthe next time you write to bath.  i think my father certainly\\nought to hear of it; do mention all about him.\"\\n\\nanne avoided a direct reply, but it was just the circumstance\\nwhich she considered as not merely unnecessary to be communicated,\\nbut as what ought to be suppressed.  the offence which had been given\\nher father, many years back, she knew; elizabeth\\'s particular share in it\\nshe suspected; and that mr elliot\\'s idea always produced irritation in both\\nwas beyond a doubt.  mary never wrote to bath herself; all the toil\\nof keeping up a slow and unsatisfactory correspondence with elizabeth\\nfell on anne.\\n\\nbreakfast had not been long over, when they were joined by captain\\nand mrs harville and captain benwick; with whom they had appointed\\nto take their last walk about lyme.  they ought to be setting off\\nfor uppercross by one, and in the mean while were to be all together,\\nand out of doors as long as they could.\\n\\nanne found captain benwick getting near her, as soon as they were all\\nfairly in the street.  their conversation the preceding evening\\ndid not disincline him to seek her again; and they walked together\\nsome time, talking as before of mr scott and lord byron,\\nand still as unable as before, and as unable as any other two readers,\\nto think exactly alike of the merits of either, till something\\noccasioned an almost general change amongst their party, and instead of\\ncaptain benwick, she had captain harville by her side.\\n\\n\"miss elliot,\" said he, speaking rather low, \"you have done a good deed\\nin making that poor fellow talk so much.  i wish he could have\\nsuch company oftener.  it is bad for him, i know, to be shut up as he is;\\nbut what can we do?  we cannot part.\"\\n\\n\"no,\" said anne, \"that i can easily believe to be impossible;\\nbut in time, perhaps--we know what time does in every case of affliction,\\nand you must remember, captain harville, that your friend\\nmay yet be called a young mourner--only last summer, i understand.\"\\n\\n\"ay, true enough,\" (with a deep sigh) \"only june.\"\\n\\n\"and not known to him, perhaps, so soon.\"\\n\\n\"not till the first week of august, when he came home from the cape,\\njust made into the grappler.  i was at plymouth dreading to hear of him;\\nhe sent in letters, but the grappler was under orders for portsmouth.\\nthere the news must follow him, but who was to tell it? not i.\\ni would as soon have been run up to the yard-arm.  nobody could do it,\\nbut that good fellow\" (pointing to captain wentworth.)  \"the laconia\\nhad come into plymouth the week before; no danger of her\\nbeing sent to sea again.  he stood his chance for the rest;\\nwrote up for leave of absence, but without waiting the return,\\ntravelled night and day till he got to portsmouth, rowed off\\nto the grappler that instant, and never left the poor fellow for a week.\\nthat\\'s what he did, and nobody else could have saved poor james.\\nyou may think, miss elliot, whether he is dear to us!\"\\n\\nanne did think on the question with perfect decision, and said as much\\nin reply as her own feeling could accomplish, or as his seemed\\nable to bear, for he was too much affected to renew the subject,\\nand when he spoke again, it was of something totally different.\\n\\nmrs harville\\'s giving it as her opinion that her husband would have\\nquite walking enough by the time he reached home, determined the direction\\nof all the party in what was to be their last walk; they would\\naccompany them to their door, and then return and set off themselves.\\nby all their calculations there was just time for this; but as they drew\\nnear the cobb, there was such a general wish to walk along it once more,\\nall were so inclined, and louisa soon grew so determined,\\nthat the difference of a quarter of an hour, it was found,\\nwould be no difference at all; so with all the kind leave-taking,\\nand all the kind interchange of invitations and promises which\\nmay be imagined, they parted from captain and mrs harville\\nat their own door, and still accompanied by captain benwick,\\nwho seemed to cling to them to the last, proceeded to make\\nthe proper adieus to the cobb.\\n\\nanne found captain benwick again drawing near her.  lord byron\\'s\\n\"dark blue seas\" could not fail of being brought forward by\\ntheir present view, and she gladly gave him all her attention as long as\\nattention was possible.  it was soon drawn, perforce another way.\\n\\nthere was too much wind to make the high part of the new cobb pleasant\\nfor the ladies, and they agreed to get down the steps to the lower,\\nand all were contented to pass quietly and carefully down the steep flight,\\nexcepting louisa; she must be jumped down them by captain wentworth.\\nin all their walks, he had had to jump her from the stiles;\\nthe sensation was delightful to her.  the hardness of the pavement\\nfor her feet, made him less willing upon the present occasion;\\nhe did it, however.  she was safely down, and instantly,\\nto show her enjoyment, ran up the steps to be jumped down again.\\nhe advised her against it, thought the jar too great; but no,\\nhe reasoned and talked in vain, she smiled and said, \"i am determined\\ni will:\" he put out his hands; she was too precipitate by half a second,\\nshe fell on the pavement on the lower cobb, and was taken up lifeless!\\nthere was no wound, no blood, no visible bruise; but her eyes were closed,\\nshe breathed not, her face was like death.  the horror of the moment\\nto all who stood around!\\n\\ncaptain wentworth, who had caught her up, knelt with her in his arms,\\nlooking on her with a face as pallid as her own, in an agony of silence.\\n\"she is dead! she is dead!\" screamed mary, catching hold of her\\nhusband, and contributing with his own horror to make him immoveable;\\nand in another moment, henrietta, sinking under the conviction, lost\\nher senses too, and would have fallen on the steps, but for captain\\nbenwick and anne, who caught and supported her between them.\\n\\n\"is there no one to help me?\" were the first words which\\nburst from captain wentworth, in a tone of despair, and as if\\nall his own strength were gone.\\n\\n\"go to him, go to him,\" cried anne, \"for heaven\\'s sake go to him.\\ni can support her myself.  leave me, and go to him.  rub her hands,\\nrub her temples; here are salts; take them, take them.\"\\n\\ncaptain benwick obeyed, and charles at the same moment,\\ndisengaging himself from his wife, they were both with him;\\nand louisa was raised up and supported more firmly between them,\\nand everything was done that anne had prompted, but in vain;\\nwhile captain wentworth, staggering against the wall for his support,\\nexclaimed in the bitterest agony--\\n\\n\"oh god! her father and mother!\"\\n\\n\"a surgeon!\" said anne.\\n\\nhe caught the word; it seemed to rouse him at once, and saying only--\\n\"true, true, a surgeon this instant,\" was darting away,\\nwhen anne eagerly suggested--\\n\\n\"captain benwick, would not it be better for captain benwick?\\nhe knows where a surgeon is to be found.\"\\n\\nevery one capable of thinking felt the advantage of the idea,\\nand in a moment (it was all done in rapid moments) captain benwick had\\nresigned the poor corpse-like  figure entirely to the brother\\'s care,\\nand was off for the town with the utmost rapidity.\\n\\nas to the wretched party left behind, it could scarcely be said\\nwhich of the three, who were completely rational, was suffering most:\\ncaptain wentworth, anne, or charles, who, really a very affectionate\\nbrother, hung over louisa with sobs of grief, and could only turn his eyes\\nfrom one sister, to see the other in a state as insensible,\\nor to witness the hysterical agitations of his wife, calling on him\\nfor help which he could not give.\\n\\nanne, attending with all the strength and zeal, and thought,\\nwhich instinct supplied, to henrietta, still tried, at intervals,\\nto suggest comfort to the others, tried to quiet mary, to animate charles,\\nto assuage the feelings of captain wentworth.  both seemed to look to her\\nfor directions.\\n\\n\"anne, anne,\" cried charles, \"what is to be done next?\\nwhat, in heaven\\'s name, is to be done next?\"\\n\\ncaptain wentworth\\'s eyes were also turned towards her.\\n\\n\"had not she better be carried to the inn?  yes, i am sure:\\ncarry her gently to the inn.\"\\n\\n\"yes, yes, to the inn,\" repeated captain wentworth, comparatively\\ncollected, and eager to be doing something.  \"i will carry her myself.\\nmusgrove, take care of the others.\"\\n\\nby this time the report of the accident had spread among the workmen\\nand boatmen about the cobb, and many were collected near them,\\nto be useful if wanted, at any rate, to enjoy the sight of\\na dead young lady, nay, two dead young ladies, for it proved twice as fine\\nas the first report.  to some of the best-looking of these good people\\nhenrietta was consigned, for, though partially revived,\\nshe was quite helpless; and in this manner, anne walking by her side,\\nand charles attending to his wife, they set forward, treading back\\nwith feelings unutterable, the ground, which so lately, so very lately,\\nand so light of heart, they had passed along.\\n\\nthey were not off the cobb, before the harvilles met them.\\ncaptain benwick had been seen flying by their house, with a countenance\\nwhich showed something to be wrong; and they had set off immediately,\\ninformed and directed as they passed, towards the spot.\\nshocked as captain harville was, he brought senses and nerves\\nthat could be instantly useful; and a look between him and his wife\\ndecided what was to be done.  she must be taken to their house;\\nall must go to their house; and await the surgeon\\'s arrival there.\\nthey would not listen to scruples:  he was obeyed; they were all\\nbeneath his roof; and while louisa, under mrs harville\\'s direction,\\nwas conveyed up stairs, and given possession of her own bed,\\nassistance, cordials, restoratives were supplied by her husband\\nto all who needed them.\\n\\nlouisa had once opened her eyes, but soon closed them again,\\nwithout apparent consciousness.  this had been a proof of life,\\nhowever, of service to her sister; and henrietta, though perfectly\\nincapable of being in the same room with louisa, was kept,\\nby the agitation of hope and fear, from a return of her own insensibility.\\nmary, too, was growing calmer.\\n\\nthe surgeon was with them almost before it had seemed possible.\\nthey were sick with horror, while he examined; but he was not hopeless.\\nthe head had received a severe contusion, but he had seen greater injuries\\nrecovered from:  he was by no means hopeless; he spoke cheerfully.\\n\\nthat he did not regard it as a desperate case, that he did not say\\na few hours must end it, was at first felt, beyond the hope of most;\\nand the ecstasy of such a reprieve, the rejoicing, deep and silent,\\nafter a few fervent ejaculations of gratitude to heaven had been offered,\\nmay be conceived.\\n\\nthe tone, the look, with which \"thank god!\" was uttered\\nby captain wentworth, anne was sure could never be forgotten by her;\\nnor the sight of him afterwards, as he sat near a table, leaning over it\\nwith folded arms and face concealed, as if overpowered by\\nthe various feelings of his soul, and trying by prayer and reflection\\nto calm them.\\n\\nlouisa\\'s limbs had escaped.  there was no injury but to the head.\\n\\nit now became necessary for the party to consider what was best to be done,\\nas to their general situation.  they were now able to speak to each other\\nand consult.  that louisa must remain where she was, however distressing\\nto her friends to be involving the harvilles in such trouble,\\ndid not admit a doubt.  her removal was impossible.  the harvilles\\nsilenced all scruples; and, as much as they could, all gratitude.\\nthey had looked forward and arranged everything before the others\\nbegan to reflect.  captain benwick must give up his room to them,\\nand get another bed elsewhere; and the whole was settled.\\nthey were only concerned that the house could accommodate no more;\\nand yet perhaps, by \"putting the children away in the maid\\'s room,\\nor swinging a cot somewhere,\" they could hardly bear to think of not\\nfinding room for two or three besides, supposing they might wish to stay;\\nthough, with regard to any attendance on miss musgrove, there need not be\\nthe least uneasiness in leaving her to mrs harville\\'s care entirely.\\nmrs harville was a very experienced nurse, and her nursery-maid,\\nwho had lived with her long, and gone about with her everywhere,\\nwas just such another.  between these two, she could want\\nno possible attendance by day or night.  and all this was said\\nwith a truth and sincerity of feeling irresistible.\\n\\ncharles, henrietta, and captain wentworth were the three in consultation,\\nand for a little while it was only an interchange of perplexity and terror.\\n\"uppercross, the necessity of some one\\'s going to uppercross;\\nthe news to be conveyed; how it could be broken to mr and mrs musgrove;\\nthe lateness of the morning; an hour already gone since they\\nought to have been off; the impossibility of being in tolerable time.\"\\nat first, they were capable of nothing more to the purpose\\nthan such exclamations; but, after a while, captain wentworth,\\nexerting himself, said--\\n\\n\"we must be decided, and without the loss of another minute.\\nevery minute is valuable.  some one must resolve on being off\\nfor uppercross instantly.  musgrove, either you or i must go.\"\\n\\ncharles agreed, but declared his resolution of not going away.\\nhe would be as little incumbrance as possible to captain and mrs harville;\\nbut as to leaving his sister in such a state, he neither ought, nor would.\\nso far it was decided; and henrietta at first declared the same.\\nshe, however, was soon persuaded to think differently.  the usefulness\\nof her staying!  she who had not been able to remain in louisa\\'s room,\\nor to look at her, without sufferings which made her worse than helpless!\\nshe was forced to acknowledge that she could do no good,\\nyet was still unwilling to be away, till, touched by the thought\\nof her father and mother, she gave it up; she consented,\\nshe was anxious to be at home.\\n\\nthe plan had reached this point, when anne, coming quietly\\ndown from louisa\\'s room, could not but hear what followed,\\nfor the parlour door was open.\\n\\n\"then it is settled, musgrove,\" cried captain wentworth,\\n\"that you stay, and that i take care of your sister home.\\nbut as to the rest, as to the others, if one stays to assist mrs harville,\\ni think it need be only one.  mrs charles musgrove will, of course,\\nwish to get back to her children; but if anne will stay, no one so proper,\\nso capable as anne.\"\\n\\nshe paused a moment to recover from the emotion of hearing herself\\nso spoken of.  the other two warmly agreed with what he said,\\nand she then appeared.\\n\\n\"you will stay, i am sure; you will stay and nurse her;\" cried he,\\nturning to her and speaking with a glow, and yet a gentleness,\\nwhich seemed almost restoring the past.  she coloured deeply,\\nand he recollected himself and moved away.  she expressed herself\\nmost willing, ready, happy to remain.  \"it was what she had been\\nthinking of, and wishing to be allowed to do.  a bed on the floor\\nin louisa\\'s room would be sufficient for her, if mrs harville\\nwould but think so.\"\\n\\none thing more, and all seemed arranged.  though it was rather desirable\\nthat mr and mrs musgrove should be previously alarmed by some\\nshare of delay; yet the time required by the uppercross horses\\nto take them back, would be a dreadful extension of suspense;\\nand captain wentworth proposed, and charles musgrove agreed,\\nthat it would be much better for him to take a chaise from the inn,\\nand leave mr musgrove\\'s carriage and horses to be sent home\\nthe next morning early, when there would be the farther advantage\\nof sending an account of louisa\\'s night.\\n\\ncaptain wentworth now hurried off to get everything ready on his part,\\nand to be soon followed by the two ladies.  when the plan was\\nmade known to mary, however, there was an end of all peace in it.\\nshe was so wretched and so vehement, complained so much of injustice\\nin being expected to go away instead of anne; anne, who was\\nnothing to louisa, while she was her sister, and had the best right\\nto stay in henrietta\\'s stead!  why was not she to be as useful as anne?\\nand to go home without charles, too, without her husband!\\nno, it was too unkind.  and in short, she said more than her husband\\ncould long withstand, and as none of the others could oppose\\nwhen he gave way, there was no help for it; the change of mary for anne\\nwas inevitable.\\n\\nanne had never submitted more reluctantly to the jealous\\nand ill-judging claims of mary; but so it must be, and they set off\\nfor the town, charles taking care of his sister, and captain benwick\\nattending to her.  she gave a moment\\'s recollection, as they hurried along,\\nto the little circumstances which the same spots had witnessed\\nearlier in the morning.  there she had listened to henrietta\\'s schemes\\nfor dr shirley\\'s leaving uppercross; farther on, she had\\nfirst seen mr elliot; a moment seemed all that could now be given\\nto any one but louisa, or those who were wrapt up in her welfare.\\n\\ncaptain benwick was most considerately attentive to her; and,\\nunited as they all seemed by the distress of the day, she felt\\nan increasing degree of good-will towards him, and a pleasure even\\nin thinking that it might, perhaps, be the occasion of continuing\\ntheir acquaintance.\\n\\ncaptain wentworth was on the watch for them, and a chaise and four in waiting,\\nstationed for their convenience in the lowest part of the street;\\nbut his evident surprise and vexation at the substitution of one sister\\nfor the other, the change in his countenance, the astonishment,\\nthe expressions begun and suppressed, with which charles was listened to,\\nmade but a mortifying reception of anne; or must at least convince her\\nthat she was valued only as she could be useful to louisa.\\n\\nshe endeavoured to be composed, and to be just.  without emulating\\nthe feelings of an emma towards her henry, she would have\\nattended on louisa with a zeal above the common claims of regard,\\nfor his sake; and she hoped he would not long be so unjust\\nas to suppose she would shrink unnecessarily from the office of a friend.\\n\\nin the mean while she was in the carriage.  he had handed them both in,\\nand placed himself between them; and in this manner, under these\\ncircumstances, full of astonishment and emotion to anne, she quitted lyme.\\nhow the long stage would pass; how it was to affect their manners;\\nwhat was to be their sort of intercourse, she could not foresee.\\nit was all quite natural, however.  he was devoted to henrietta;\\nalways turning towards her; and when he spoke at all, always with the view\\nof supporting her hopes and raising her spirits.  in general,\\nhis voice and manner were studiously calm.  to spare henrietta\\nfrom agitation seemed the governing principle.  once only,\\nwhen she had been grieving over the last ill-judged, ill-fated\\nwalk to the cobb, bitterly lamenting that it ever had been thought of,\\nhe burst forth, as if wholly overcome--\\n\\n\"don\\'t talk of it, don\\'t talk of it,\" he cried.  \"oh god! that i had\\nnot given way to her at the fatal moment!  had i done as i ought!\\nbut so eager and so resolute! dear, sweet louisa!\"\\n\\nanne wondered whether it ever occurred to him now, to question the justness\\nof his own previous opinion as to the universal felicity and advantage\\nof firmness of character; and whether it might not strike him that,\\nlike all other qualities of the mind, it should have its proportions\\nand limits.  she thought it could scarcely escape him to feel\\nthat a persuadable temper might sometimes be as much in favour of happiness\\nas a very resolute character.\\n\\nthey got on fast.  anne was astonished to recognise the same hills\\nand the same objects so soon.  their actual speed, heightened by\\nsome dread of the conclusion, made the road appear but half as long\\nas on the day before.  it was growing quite dusk, however,\\nbefore they were in the neighbourhood of uppercross, and there had been\\ntotal silence among them for some time, henrietta leaning back\\nin the corner, with a shawl over her face, giving the hope of her\\nhaving cried herself to sleep; when, as they were going up their last hill,\\nanne found herself all at once addressed by captain wentworth.\\nin a low, cautious voice, he said: --\\n\\n\"i have been considering what we had best do.  she must not\\nappear at first.  she could not stand it.  i have been thinking whether\\nyou had not better remain in the carriage with her, while i go in\\nand break it to mr and mrs musgrove.  do you think this is a good plan?\"\\n\\nshe did:  he was satisfied, and said no more.  but the remembrance\\nof the appeal remained a pleasure to her, as a proof of friendship,\\nand of deference for her judgement, a great pleasure; and when it became\\na sort of parting proof, its value did not lessen.\\n\\nwhen the distressing communication at uppercross was over,\\nand he had seen the father and mother quite as composed as could be hoped,\\nand the daughter all the better for being with them, he announced\\nhis intention of returning in the same carriage to lyme;\\nand when the horses were baited, he was off.\\n\\n(end of volume one.)\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 13\\n\\n\\nthe remainder of anne\\'s time at uppercross, comprehending only two days,\\nwas spent entirely at the mansion house; and she had the satisfaction\\nof knowing herself extremely useful there, both as an immediate companion,\\nand as assisting in all those arrangements for the future, which,\\nin mr and mrs musgrove\\'s distressed state of spirits, would have\\nbeen difficulties.\\n\\nthey had an early account from lyme the next morning.  louisa was\\nmuch the same.  no symptoms worse than before had appeared.\\ncharles came a few hours afterwards, to bring a later and\\nmore particular account.  he was tolerably cheerful.  a speedy cure\\nmust not be hoped, but everything was going on as well\\nas the nature of the case admitted.  in speaking of the harvilles,\\nhe seemed unable to satisfy his own sense of their kindness,\\nespecially of mrs harville\\'s exertions as a nurse.  \"she really left\\nnothing for mary to do.  he and mary had been persuaded to go early\\nto their inn last night.  mary had been hysterical again this morning.\\nwhen he came away, she was going to walk out with captain benwick,\\nwhich, he hoped, would do her good.  he almost wished she had been\\nprevailed on to come home the day before; but the truth was,\\nthat mrs harville left nothing for anybody to do.\"\\n\\ncharles was to return to lyme the same afternoon, and his father\\nhad at first half a mind to go with him, but the ladies could not consent.\\nit would be going only to multiply trouble to the others,\\nand increase his own distress; and a much better scheme followed\\nand was acted upon.  a chaise was sent for from crewkherne,\\nand charles conveyed back a far more useful person in the old nursery-maid\\nof the family, one who having brought up all the children,\\nand seen the very last, the lingering and long-petted master harry,\\nsent to school after his brothers, was now living in her deserted nursery\\nto mend stockings and dress all the blains and bruises she could\\nget near her, and who, consequently, was only too happy in being\\nallowed to go and help nurse dear miss louisa.  vague wishes of\\ngetting sarah thither, had occurred before to mrs musgrove and henrietta;\\nbut without anne, it would hardly have been resolved on,\\nand found practicable so soon.\\n\\nthey were indebted, the next day, to charles hayter, for all\\nthe minute knowledge of louisa, which it was so essential to obtain\\nevery twenty-four hours.  he made it his business to go to lyme,\\nand his account was still encouraging.  the intervals of sense\\nand consciousness were believed to be stronger.  every report agreed\\nin captain wentworth\\'s appearing fixed in lyme.\\n\\nanne was to leave them on the morrow, an event which they all dreaded.\\n\"what should they do without her?  they were wretched comforters\\nfor one another.\"  and so much was said in this way, that anne thought\\nshe could not do better than impart among them the general inclination\\nto which she was privy, and persuaded them all to go to lyme at once.\\nshe had little difficulty; it was soon determined that they would go;\\ngo to-morrow, fix themselves at the inn, or get into lodgings,\\nas it suited, and there remain till dear louisa could be moved.\\nthey must be taking off some trouble from the good people she was with;\\nthey might at least relieve mrs harville from the care of her own children;\\nand in short, they were so happy in the decision, that anne was delighted\\nwith what she had done, and felt that she could not spend her\\nlast morning at uppercross better than in assisting their preparations,\\nand sending them off at an early hour, though her being left\\nto the solitary range of the house was the consequence.\\n\\nshe was the last, excepting the little boys at the cottage,\\nshe was the very last, the only remaining one of all that had filled\\nand animated both houses, of all that had given uppercross\\nits cheerful character.  a few days had made a change indeed!\\n\\nif louisa recovered, it would all be well again.  more than\\nformer happiness would be restored.  there could not be a doubt,\\nto her mind there was none, of what would follow her recovery.\\na few months hence, and the room now so deserted, occupied but by\\nher silent, pensive self, might be filled again with all that was happy\\nand gay, all that was glowing and bright in prosperous love,\\nall that was most unlike anne elliot!\\n\\nan hour\\'s complete leisure for such reflections as these,\\non a dark november day, a small thick rain almost blotting out\\nthe very few objects ever to be discerned from the windows, was enough\\nto make the sound of lady russell\\'s carriage exceedingly welcome;\\nand yet, though desirous to be gone, she could not quit the mansion house,\\nor look an adieu to the cottage, with its black, dripping and\\ncomfortless veranda, or even notice through the misty glasses\\nthe last humble tenements of the village, without a saddened heart.\\nscenes had passed in uppercross which made it precious.\\nit stood the record of many sensations of pain, once severe,\\nbut now softened; and of some instances of relenting feeling,\\nsome breathings of friendship and reconciliation, which could\\nnever be looked for again, and which could never cease to be dear.\\nshe left it all behind her, all but the recollection that\\nsuch things had been.\\n\\nanne had never entered kellynch since her quitting lady russell\\'s house\\nin september.  it had not been necessary, and the few occasions of\\nits being possible for her to go to the hall she had contrived to evade\\nand escape from.  her first return was to resume her place in the modern\\nand elegant apartments of the lodge, and to gladden the eyes\\nof its mistress.\\n\\nthere was some anxiety mixed with lady russell\\'s joy in meeting her.\\nshe knew who had been frequenting uppercross.  but happily,\\neither anne was improved in plumpness and looks, or lady russell\\nfancied her so; and anne, in receiving her compliments on the occasion,\\nhad the amusement of connecting them with the silent admiration\\nof her cousin, and of hoping that she was to be blessed with\\na second spring of youth and beauty.\\n\\nwhen they came to converse, she was soon sensible of some mental change.\\nthe subjects of which her heart had been full on leaving kellynch,\\nand which she had felt slighted, and been compelled to smother\\namong the musgroves, were now become but of secondary interest.\\nshe had lately lost sight even of her father and sister and bath.\\ntheir concerns had been sunk under those of uppercross;\\nand when lady russell reverted to their former hopes and fears,\\nand spoke her satisfaction in the house in camden place,\\nwhich had been taken, and her regret that mrs clay should still\\nbe with them, anne would have been ashamed to have it known\\nhow much more she was thinking of lyme and louisa musgrove,\\nand all her acquaintance there; how much more interesting to her\\nwas the home and the friendship of the harvilles and captain benwick,\\nthan her own father\\'s house in camden place, or her own sister\\'s intimacy\\nwith mrs clay.  she was actually forced to exert herself\\nto meet lady russell with anything like the appearance of equal solicitude,\\non topics which had by nature the first claim on her.\\n\\nthere was a little awkwardness at first in their discourse\\non another subject.  they must speak of the accident at lyme.\\nlady russell had not been arrived five minutes the day before,\\nwhen a full account of the whole had burst on her; but still it must\\nbe talked of, she must make enquiries, she must regret the imprudence,\\nlament the result, and captain wentworth\\'s name must be mentioned by both.\\nanne was conscious of not doing it so well as lady russell.\\nshe could not speak the name, and look straight forward to\\nlady russell\\'s eye, till she had adopted the expedient of telling her\\nbriefly what she thought of the attachment between him and louisa.\\nwhen this was told, his name distressed her no longer.\\n\\nlady russell had only to listen composedly, and wish them happy,\\nbut internally her heart revelled in angry pleasure, in pleased contempt,\\nthat the man who at twenty-three had seemed to understand somewhat\\nof the value of an anne elliot, should, eight years afterwards,\\nbe charmed by a louisa musgrove.\\n\\nthe first three or four days passed most quietly, with no circumstance\\nto mark them excepting the receipt of a note or two from lyme,\\nwhich found their way to anne, she could not tell how, and brought\\na rather improving account of louisa.  at the end of that period,\\nlady russell\\'s politeness could repose no longer, and the fainter\\nself-threatenings of the past became in a decided tone,\\n\"i must call on mrs croft; i really must call upon her soon.\\nanne, have you courage to go with me, and pay a visit in that house?\\nit will be some trial to us both.\"\\n\\nanne did not shrink from it; on the contrary, she truly felt as she said,\\nin observing--\\n\\n\"i think you are very likely to suffer the most of the two;\\nyour feelings are less reconciled to the change than mine.\\nby remaining in the neighbourhood, i am become inured to it.\"\\n\\nshe could have said more on the subject; for she had in fact\\nso high an opinion of the crofts, and considered her father\\nso very fortunate in his tenants, felt the parish to be so sure\\nof a good example, and the poor of the best attention and relief,\\nthat however sorry and ashamed for the necessity of the removal,\\nshe could not but in conscience feel that they were gone\\nwho deserved not to stay, and that kellynch hall had passed\\ninto better hands than its owners\\'.  these convictions must unquestionably\\nhave their own pain, and severe was its kind; but they precluded\\nthat pain which lady russell would suffer in entering the house again,\\nand returning through the well-known apartments.\\n\\nin such moments anne had no power of saying to herself,\\n\"these rooms ought to belong only to us.  oh, how fallen\\nin their destination!  how unworthily occupied!  an ancient family\\nto be so driven away!  strangers filling their place!\"\\nno, except when she thought of her mother, and remembered where\\nshe had been used to sit and preside, she had no sigh of that description\\nto heave.\\n\\nmrs croft always met her with a kindness which gave her the pleasure\\nof fancying herself a favourite, and on the present occasion,\\nreceiving her in that house, there was particular attention.\\n\\nthe sad accident at lyme was soon the prevailing topic,\\nand on comparing their latest accounts of the invalid, it appeared\\nthat each lady dated her intelligence from the same hour of yestermorn;\\nthat captain wentworth had been in kellynch yesterday (the first time\\nsince the accident), had brought anne the last note, which she had\\nnot been able to trace the exact steps of; had staid a few hours\\nand then returned again to lyme, and without any present intention\\nof quitting it any more.  he had enquired after her, she found,\\nparticularly; had expressed his hope of miss elliot\\'s not being\\nthe worse for her exertions, and had spoken of those exertions as great.\\nthis was handsome, and gave her more pleasure than almost anything else\\ncould have done.\\n\\nas to the sad catastrophe itself, it could be canvassed only in one style\\nby a couple of steady, sensible women, whose judgements had to work\\non ascertained events; and it was perfectly decided that it had been\\nthe consequence of much thoughtlessness and much imprudence;\\nthat its effects were most alarming, and that it was frightful to think,\\nhow long miss musgrove\\'s recovery might yet be doubtful, and how liable\\nshe would still remain to suffer from the concussion hereafter!\\nthe admiral wound it up summarily by exclaiming--\\n\\n\"ay, a very bad business indeed.  a new sort of way this,\\nfor a young fellow to be making love, by breaking his mistress\\'s head,\\nis not it, miss elliot?  this is breaking a head and giving a plaster,\\ntruly!\"\\n\\nadmiral croft\\'s manners were not quite of the tone to suit lady russell,\\nbut they delighted anne.  his goodness of heart and simplicity\\nof character were irresistible.\\n\\n\"now, this must be very bad for you,\" said he, suddenly rousing from\\na little reverie, \"to be coming and finding us here.  i had not\\nrecollected it before, i declare, but it must be very bad.\\nbut now, do not stand upon ceremony.  get up and go over all the rooms\\nin the house if you like it.\"\\n\\n\"another time, sir, i thank you, not now.\"\\n\\n\"well, whenever it suits you.  you can slip in from the shrubbery\\nat any time; and there you will find we keep our umbrellas hanging up\\nby that door.  a good place is not it?  but,\" (checking himself),\\n\"you will not think it a good place, for yours were always kept\\nin the butler\\'s room.  ay, so it always is, i believe.\\none man\\'s ways may be as good as another\\'s, but we all like our own best.\\nand so you must judge for yourself, whether it would be better for you\\nto go about the house or not.\"\\n\\nanne, finding she might decline it, did so, very gratefully.\\n\\n\"we have made very few changes either,\" continued the admiral,\\nafter thinking a moment.  \"very few.  we told you about the laundry-door,\\nat uppercross.  that has been a very great improvement.\\nthe wonder was, how any family upon earth could bear with the inconvenience\\nof its opening as it did, so long!  you will tell sir walter\\nwhat we have done, and that mr shepherd thinks it the greatest improvement\\nthe house ever had.  indeed, i must do ourselves the justice to say,\\nthat the few alterations we have made have been all very much\\nfor the better.  my wife should have the credit of them, however.\\ni have done very little besides sending away some of the large\\nlooking-glasses from my dressing-room, which was your father\\'s.\\na very good man, and very much the gentleman i am sure:\\nbut i should think, miss elliot,\" (looking with serious reflection),\\n\"i should think he must be rather a dressy man for his time of life.\\nsuch a number of looking-glasses! oh lord! there was no getting away\\nfrom one\\'s self.  so i got sophy to lend me a hand, and we soon\\nshifted their quarters; and now i am quite snug, with my\\nlittle shaving glass in one corner, and another great thing\\nthat i never go near.\"\\n\\nanne, amused in spite of herself, was rather distressed for an answer,\\nand the admiral, fearing he might not have been civil enough,\\ntook up the subject again, to say--\\n\\n\"the next time you write to your good father, miss elliot,\\npray give him my compliments and mrs croft\\'s, and say that we are\\nsettled here quite to our liking, and have no fault at all to find\\nwith the place.  the breakfast-room chimney smokes a little,\\ni grant you, but it is only when the wind is due north and blows hard,\\nwhich may not happen three times a winter.  and take it altogether,\\nnow that we have been into most of the houses hereabouts and can judge,\\nthere is not one that we like better than this.  pray say so,\\nwith my compliments.  he will be glad to hear it.\"\\n\\nlady russell and mrs croft were very well pleased with each other:\\nbut the acquaintance which this visit began was fated not to proceed\\nfar at present; for when it was returned, the crofts announced\\nthemselves to be going away for a few weeks, to visit their connexions\\nin the north of the county, and probably might not be at home again\\nbefore lady russell would be removing to bath.\\n\\nso ended all danger to anne of meeting captain wentworth at kellynch hall,\\nor of seeing him in company with her friend.  everything was safe enough,\\nand she smiled over the many anxious feelings she had wasted\\non the subject.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 14\\n\\n\\nthough charles and mary had remained at lyme much longer after\\nmr and mrs musgrove\\'s going than anne conceived they could have been\\nat all wanted, they were yet the first of the family to be at home again;\\nand as soon as possible after their return to uppercross\\nthey drove over to the lodge.  they had left louisa beginning to sit up;\\nbut her head, though clear, was exceedingly weak, and her nerves\\nsusceptible to the highest extreme of tenderness; and though\\nshe might be pronounced to be altogether doing very well,\\nit was still impossible to say when she might be able to bear\\nthe removal home; and her father and mother, who must return\\nin time to receive their younger children for the christmas holidays,\\nhad hardly a hope of being allowed to bring her with them.\\n\\nthey had been all in lodgings together.  mrs musgrove had\\ngot mrs harville\\'s children away as much as she could, every possible\\nsupply from uppercross had been furnished, to lighten the inconvenience\\nto the harvilles, while the harvilles had been wanting them\\nto come to dinner every day; and in short, it seemed to have been\\nonly a struggle on each side as to which should be most disinterested\\nand hospitable.\\n\\nmary had had her evils; but upon the whole, as was evident\\nby her staying so long, she had found more to enjoy than to suffer.\\ncharles hayter had been at lyme oftener than suited her; and when\\nthey dined with the harvilles there had been only a maid-servant to wait,\\nand at first mrs harville had always given mrs musgrove precedence;\\nbut then, she had received so very handsome an apology from her\\non finding out whose daughter she was, and there had been so much\\ngoing on every day, there had been so many walks between their lodgings\\nand the harvilles, and she had got books from the library,\\nand changed them so often, that the balance had certainly been\\nmuch in favour of lyme.  she had been taken to charmouth too,\\nand she had bathed, and she had gone to church, and there were a great many\\nmore people to look at in the church at lyme than at uppercross;\\nand all this, joined to the sense of being so very useful,\\nhad made really an agreeable fortnight.\\n\\nanne enquired after captain benwick, mary\\'s face was clouded directly.\\ncharles laughed.\\n\\n\"oh! captain benwick is very well, i believe, but he is\\na very odd young man.  i do not know what he would be at.\\nwe asked him to come home with us for a day or two:  charles undertook\\nto give him some shooting, and he seemed quite delighted, and, for my part,\\ni thought it was all settled; when behold! on tuesday night,\\nhe made a very awkward sort of excuse; `he never shot\\' and he had\\n`been quite misunderstood,\\' and he had promised this and he had\\npromised that, and the end of it was, i found, that he did not mean to come.\\ni suppose he was afraid of finding it dull; but upon my word\\ni should have thought we were lively enough at the cottage\\nfor such a heart-broken man as captain benwick.\"\\n\\ncharles laughed again and said, \"now mary, you know very well\\nhow it really was.  it was all your doing,\" (turning to anne.)\\n\"he fancied that if he went with us, he should find you close by:\\nhe fancied everybody to be living in uppercross; and when he discovered\\nthat lady russell lived three miles off, his heart failed him,\\nand he had not courage to come.  that is the fact, upon my honour,\\nmary knows it is.\"\\n\\nbut mary did not give into it very graciously, whether from\\nnot considering captain benwick entitled by birth and situation\\nto be in love with an elliot, or from not wanting to believe\\nanne a greater attraction to uppercross than herself, must be\\nleft to be guessed.  anne\\'s good-will, however, was not to be lessened\\nby what she heard.  she boldly acknowledged herself flattered,\\nand continued her enquiries.\\n\\n\"oh! he talks of you,\" cried charles, \"in such terms--\"\\nmary interrupted him. \"i declare, charles, i never heard him\\nmention anne twice all the time i was there.  i declare, anne,\\nhe never talks of you at all.\"\\n\\n\"no,\" admitted charles, \"i do not know that he ever does, in a general\\nway; but however, it is a very clear thing that he admires you exceedingly.\\nhis head is full of some books that he is reading upon your recommendation,\\nand he wants to talk to you about them; he has found out something or other\\nin one of them which he thinks--oh! i cannot pretend to remember it,\\nbut it was something very fine--i overheard him telling henrietta\\nall about it; and then `miss elliot\\' was spoken of in the highest terms!\\nnow mary, i declare it was so, i heard it myself, and you were\\nin the other room.  `elegance, sweetness, beauty.\\' oh! there was no end\\nof miss elliot\\'s charms.\"\\n\\n\"and i am sure,\" cried mary, warmly, \"it was a very little to his credit,\\nif he did.  miss harville only died last june.  such a heart\\nis very little worth having; is it, lady russell?  i am sure\\nyou will agree with me.\"\\n\\n\"i must see captain benwick before i decide,\" said lady russell, smiling.\\n\\n\"and that you are very likely to do very soon, i can tell you, ma\\'am,\"\\nsaid charles.  \"though he had not nerves for coming away with us,\\nand setting off again afterwards to pay a formal visit here,\\nhe will make his way over to kellynch one day by himself,\\nyou may depend on it.  i told him the distance and the road,\\nand i told him of the church\\'s being so very well worth seeing;\\nfor as he has a taste for those sort of things, i thought that would\\nbe a good excuse, and he listened with all his understanding and soul;\\nand i am sure from his manner that you will have him calling here soon.\\nso, i give you notice, lady russell.\"\\n\\n\"any acquaintance of anne\\'s will always be welcome to me,\"\\nwas lady russell\\'s kind answer.\\n\\n\"oh! as to being anne\\'s acquaintance,\" said mary, \"i think he is rather\\nmy acquaintance, for i have been seeing him every day this last fortnight.\"\\n\\n\"well, as your joint acquaintance, then, i shall be very happy\\nto see captain benwick.\"\\n\\n\"you will not find anything very agreeable in him, i assure you, ma\\'am.\\nhe is one of the dullest young men that ever lived.  he has walked with me,\\nsometimes, from one end of the sands to the other, without saying a word.\\nhe is not at all a well-bred young man.  i am sure you will not like him.\"\\n\\n\"there we differ, mary,\" said anne.  \"i think lady russell would like him.\\ni think she would be so much pleased with his mind, that she would\\nvery soon see no deficiency in his manner.\"\\n\\n\"so do i, anne,\" said charles.  \"i am sure lady russell would like him.\\nhe is just lady russell\\'s sort.  give him a book, and he will\\nread all day long.\"\\n\\n\"yes, that he will!\" exclaimed mary, tauntingly.  \"he will sit poring\\nover his book, and not know when a person speaks to him, or when one\\ndrop\\'s one\\'s scissors, or anything that happens.  do you think\\nlady russell would like that?\"\\n\\nlady russell could not help laughing.  \"upon my word,\" said she,\\n\"i should not have supposed that my opinion of any one could have\\nadmitted of such difference of conjecture, steady and matter of fact\\nas i may call myself.  i have really a curiosity to see the person\\nwho can give occasion to such directly opposite notions.\\ni wish he may be induced to call here.  and when he does, mary,\\nyou may depend upon hearing my opinion; but i am determined\\nnot to judge him beforehand.\"\\n\\n\"you will not like him, i will answer for it.\"\\n\\nlady russell began talking of something else.  mary spoke with animation\\nof their meeting with, or rather missing, mr elliot so extraordinarily.\\n\\n\"he is a man,\" said lady russell, \"whom i have no wish to see.\\nhis declining to be on cordial terms with the head of his family,\\nhas left a very strong impression in his disfavour with me.\"\\n\\nthis decision checked mary\\'s eagerness, and stopped her short\\nin the midst of the elliot countenance.\\n\\nwith regard to captain wentworth, though anne hazarded no enquiries,\\nthere was voluntary communication sufficient.  his spirits had been\\ngreatly recovering lately as might be expected.  as louisa improved,\\nhe had improved, and he was now quite a different creature\\nfrom what he had been the first week.  he had not seen louisa;\\nand was so extremely fearful of any ill consequence to her\\nfrom an interview, that he did not press for it at all; and,\\non the contrary, seemed to have a plan of going away for a week\\nor ten days, till her head was stronger.  he had talked of going\\ndown to plymouth for a week, and wanted to persuade captain benwick\\nto go with him; but, as charles maintained to the last, captain benwick\\nseemed much more disposed to ride over to kellynch.\\n\\nthere can be no doubt that lady russell and anne were both\\noccasionally thinking of captain benwick, from this time.\\nlady russell could not hear the door-bell without feeling that it might\\nbe his herald; nor could anne return from any stroll of solitary indulgence\\nin her father\\'s grounds, or any visit of charity in the village,\\nwithout wondering whether she might see him or hear of him.\\ncaptain benwick came not, however.  he was either less disposed for it\\nthan charles had imagined, or he was too shy; and after giving him\\na week\\'s indulgence, lady russell determined him to be unworthy\\nof the interest which he had been beginning to excite.\\n\\nthe musgroves came back to receive their happy boys and girls from school,\\nbringing with them mrs harville\\'s little children, to improve the noise\\nof uppercross, and lessen that of lyme.  henrietta remained with louisa;\\nbut all the rest of the family were again in their usual quarters.\\n\\nlady russell and anne paid their compliments to them once,\\nwhen anne could not but feel that uppercross was already quite alive again.\\nthough neither henrietta, nor louisa, nor charles hayter,\\nnor captain wentworth were there, the room presented as strong a contrast\\nas could be wished to the last state she had seen it in.\\n\\nimmediately surrounding mrs musgrove were the little harvilles,\\nwhom she was sedulously guarding from the tyranny of the two children\\nfrom the cottage, expressly arrived to amuse them.  on one side\\nwas a table occupied by some chattering girls, cutting up silk\\nand gold paper; and on the other were tressels and trays,\\nbending under the weight of brawn and cold pies, where riotous boys\\nwere holding high revel; the whole completed by a roaring christmas fire,\\nwhich seemed determined to be heard, in spite of all the noise\\nof the others.  charles and mary also came in, of course,\\nduring their visit, and mr musgrove made a point of paying his respects\\nto lady russell, and sat down close to her for ten minutes,\\ntalking with a very raised voice, but from the clamour of the children\\non his knees, generally in vain.  it was a fine family-piece.\\n\\nanne, judging from her own temperament, would have deemed\\nsuch a domestic hurricane a bad restorative of the nerves,\\nwhich louisa\\'s illness must have so greatly shaken.  but mrs musgrove,\\nwho got anne near her on purpose to thank her most cordially,\\nagain and again, for all her attentions to them, concluded\\na short recapitulation of what she had suffered herself by observing,\\nwith a happy glance round the room, that after all she had gone through,\\nnothing was so likely to do her good as a little quiet cheerfulness\\nat home.\\n\\nlouisa was now recovering apace.  her mother could even think of her\\nbeing able to join their party at home, before her brothers and sisters\\nwent to school again.  the harvilles had promised to come with her\\nand stay at uppercross, whenever she returned.  captain wentworth was gone,\\nfor the present, to see his brother in shropshire.\\n\\n\"i hope i shall remember, in future,\" said lady russell, as soon as\\nthey were reseated in the carriage, \"not to call at uppercross\\nin the christmas holidays.\"\\n\\neverybody has their taste in noises as well as in other matters;\\nand sounds are quite innoxious, or most distressing, by their sort\\nrather than their quantity.  when lady russell not long afterwards,\\nwas entering bath on a wet afternoon, and driving through\\nthe long course of streets from the old bridge to camden place,\\namidst the dash of other carriages, the heavy rumble of carts and drays,\\nthe bawling of newspapermen, muffin-men and milkmen, and the ceaseless\\nclink of pattens, she made no complaint.  no, these were noises\\nwhich belonged to the winter pleasures; her spirits rose\\nunder their influence; and like mrs musgrove, she was feeling,\\nthough not saying, that after being long in the country, nothing could be\\nso good for her as a little quiet cheerfulness.\\n\\nanne did not share these feelings.  she persisted in a very determined,\\nthough very silent disinclination for bath; caught the first dim view\\nof the extensive buildings, smoking in rain, without any wish\\nof seeing them better; felt their progress through the streets to be,\\nhowever disagreeable, yet too rapid; for who would be glad to see her\\nwhen she arrived?  and looked back, with fond regret, to the bustles\\nof uppercross and the seclusion of kellynch.\\n\\nelizabeth\\'s last letter had communicated a piece of news of some interest.\\nmr elliot was in bath.  he had called in camden place; had called\\na second time, a third; had been pointedly attentive.  if elizabeth\\nand her father did not deceive themselves, had been taking much pains\\nto seek the acquaintance, and proclaim the value of the connection,\\nas he had formerly taken pains to shew neglect.  this was very wonderful\\nif it were true; and lady russell was in a state of very agreeable\\ncuriosity and perplexity about mr elliot, already recanting the sentiment\\nshe had so lately expressed to mary, of his being \"a man whom she had\\nno wish to see.\"  she had a great wish to see him.  if he really sought\\nto reconcile himself like a dutiful branch, he must be forgiven\\nfor having dismembered himself from the paternal tree.\\n\\nanne was not animated to an equal pitch by the circumstance,\\nbut she felt that she would rather see mr elliot again than not,\\nwhich was more than she could say for many other persons in bath.\\n\\nshe was put down in camden place; and lady russell then drove\\nto her own lodgings, in rivers street.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 15\\n\\n\\nsir walter had taken a very good house in camden place,\\na lofty dignified situation, such as becomes a man of consequence;\\nand both he and elizabeth were settled there, much to their satisfaction.\\n\\nanne entered it with a sinking heart, anticipating an imprisonment\\nof many months, and anxiously saying to herself, \"oh! when shall i\\nleave you again?\"  a degree of unexpected cordiality, however,\\nin the welcome she received, did her good.  her father and sister\\nwere glad to see her, for the sake of shewing her the house and furniture,\\nand met her with kindness.  her making a fourth, when they\\nsat down to dinner, was noticed as an advantage.\\n\\nmrs clay was very pleasant, and very smiling, but her courtesies and smiles\\nwere more a matter of course.  anne had always felt that she would\\npretend what was proper on her arrival, but the complaisance of the others\\nwas unlooked for.  they were evidently in excellent spirits,\\nand she was soon to listen to the causes.  they had no inclination\\nto listen to her.  after laying out for some compliments of being\\ndeeply regretted in their old neighbourhood, which anne could not pay,\\nthey had only a few faint enquiries to make, before the talk must be\\nall their own.  uppercross excited no interest, kellynch very little:\\nit was all bath.\\n\\nthey had the pleasure of assuring her that bath more than answered\\ntheir expectations in every respect.  their house was undoubtedly\\nthe best in camden place; their drawing-rooms had many decided advantages\\nover all the others which they had either seen or heard of,\\nand the superiority was not less in the style of the fitting-up,\\nor the taste of the furniture.  their acquaintance was\\nexceedingly sought after.  everybody was wanting to visit them.\\nthey had drawn back from many introductions, and still were\\nperpetually having cards left by people of whom they knew nothing.\\n\\nhere were funds of enjoyment.  could anne wonder that her father\\nand sister were happy?  she might not wonder, but she must sigh\\nthat her father should feel no degradation in his change, should see\\nnothing to regret in the duties and dignity of the resident landholder,\\nshould find so much to be vain of in the littlenesses of a town;\\nand she must sigh, and smile, and wonder too, as elizabeth threw open\\nthe folding-doors and walked with exultation from one drawing-room\\nto the other, boasting of their space; at the possibility of that woman,\\nwho had been mistress of kellynch hall, finding extent to be proud of\\nbetween two walls, perhaps thirty feet asunder.\\n\\nbut this was not all which they had to make them happy.\\nthey had mr elliot too.  anne had a great deal to hear of mr elliot.\\nhe was not only pardoned, they were delighted with him.\\nhe had been in bath about a fortnight; (he had passed through bath\\nin november, in his way to london, when the intelligence of\\nsir walter\\'s being settled there had of course reached him,\\nthough only twenty-four hours in the place, but he had not been able\\nto avail himself of it;) but he had now been a fortnight in bath,\\nand his first object on arriving, had been to leave his card\\nin camden place, following it up by such assiduous endeavours to meet,\\nand when they did meet, by such great openness of conduct,\\nsuch readiness to apologize for the past, such solicitude to be received\\nas a relation again, that their former good understanding\\nwas completely re-established.\\n\\nthey had not a fault to find in him.  he had explained away\\nall the appearance of neglect on his own side.  it had originated\\nin misapprehension entirely.  he had never had an idea of\\nthrowing himself off; he had feared that he was thrown off,\\nbut knew not why, and delicacy had kept him silent.  upon the hint\\nof having spoken disrespectfully or carelessly of the family\\nand the family honours, he was quite indignant.  he, who had ever boasted\\nof being an elliot, and whose feelings, as to connection,\\nwere only too strict to suit the unfeudal tone of the present day.\\nhe was astonished, indeed, but his character and general conduct\\nmust refute it.  he could refer sir walter to all who knew him;\\nand certainly, the pains he had been taking on this, the first opportunity\\nof reconciliation, to be restored to the footing of a relation\\nand heir-presumptive, was a strong proof of his opinions on the subject.\\n\\nthe circumstances of his marriage, too, were found to admit of\\nmuch extenuation.  this was an article not to be entered on by himself;\\nbut a very intimate friend of his, a colonel wallis, a highly\\nrespectable man, perfectly the gentleman, (and not an ill-looking man,\\nsir walter added), who was living in very good style in marlborough\\nbuildings, and had, at his own particular request, been admitted\\nto their acquaintance through mr elliot, had mentioned one or two things\\nrelative to the marriage, which made a material difference\\nin the discredit of it.\\n\\ncolonel wallis had known mr elliot long, had been well acquainted\\nalso with his wife, had perfectly understood the whole story.\\nshe was certainly not a woman of family, but well educated,\\naccomplished, rich, and excessively in love with his friend.\\nthere had been the charm.  she had sought him.  without that attraction,\\nnot all her money would have tempted elliot, and sir walter was,\\nmoreover, assured of her having been a very fine woman.\\nhere was a great deal to soften the business.  a very fine woman\\nwith a large fortune, in love with him!  sir walter seemed to admit it\\nas complete apology; and though elizabeth could not see the circumstance\\nin quite so favourable a light, she allowed it be a great extenuation.\\n\\nmr elliot had called repeatedly, had dined with them once,\\nevidently delighted by the distinction of being asked, for they\\ngave no dinners in general; delighted, in short, by every proof\\nof cousinly notice, and placing his whole happiness in being\\non intimate terms in camden place.\\n\\nanne listened, but without quite understanding it.  allowances,\\nlarge allowances, she knew, must be made for the ideas of those who spoke.\\nshe heard it all under embellishment.  all that sounded extravagant\\nor irrational in the progress of the reconciliation might have no origin\\nbut in the language of the relators.  still, however, she had\\nthe sensation of there being something more than immediately appeared,\\nin mr elliot\\'s wishing, after an interval of so many years,\\nto be well received by them.  in a worldly view, he had nothing to gain\\nby being on terms with sir walter; nothing to risk by a state of variance.\\nin all probability he was already the richer of the two,\\nand the kellynch estate would as surely be his hereafter as the title.\\na sensible man, and he had looked like a very sensible man,\\nwhy should it be an object to him?  she could only offer one solution;\\nit was, perhaps, for elizabeth\\'s sake.  there might really have been\\na liking formerly, though convenience and accident had drawn him\\na different way; and now that he could afford to please himself,\\nhe might mean to pay his addresses to her.  elizabeth was certainly\\nvery handsome, with well-bred, elegant manners, and her character\\nmight never have been penetrated by mr elliot, knowing her but in public,\\nand when very young himself.  how her temper and understanding\\nmight bear the investigation of his present keener time of life\\nwas another concern and rather a fearful one.  most earnestly did she wish\\nthat he might not be too nice, or too observant if elizabeth\\nwere his object; and that elizabeth was disposed to believe herself so,\\nand that her friend mrs clay was encouraging the idea, seemed apparent\\nby a glance or two between them, while mr elliot\\'s frequent visits\\nwere talked of.\\n\\nanne mentioned the glimpses she had had of him at lyme, but without\\nbeing much attended to.  \"oh! yes, perhaps, it had been mr elliot.\\nthey did not know.  it might be him, perhaps.\"  they could not listen\\nto her description of him.  they were describing him themselves;\\nsir walter especially.  he did justice to his very gentlemanlike\\nappearance, his air of elegance and fashion, his good shaped face,\\nhis sensible eye; but, at the same time, \"must lament his being\\nvery much under-hung, a defect which time seemed to have increased;\\nnor could he pretend to say that ten years had not altered\\nalmost every feature for the worse.  mr elliot appeared to think\\nthat he (sir walter) was looking exactly as he had done when\\nthey last parted;\" but sir walter had \"not been able to return\\nthe compliment entirely, which had embarrassed him.  he did not mean\\nto complain, however.  mr elliot was better to look at than most men,\\nand he had no objection to being seen with him anywhere.\"\\n\\nmr elliot, and his friends in marlborough buildings, were talked of\\nthe whole evening.  \"colonel wallis had been so impatient to be\\nintroduced to them! and mr elliot so anxious that he should!\"\\nand there was a mrs wallis, at present known only to them by description,\\nas she was in daily expectation of her confinement; but mr elliot\\nspoke of her as \"a most charming woman, quite worthy of being known\\nin camden place,\" and as soon as she recovered they were to be acquainted.\\nsir walter thought much of mrs wallis; she was said to be\\nan excessively pretty woman, beautiful.  \"he longed to see her.\\nhe hoped she might make some amends for the many very plain faces\\nhe was continually passing in the streets.  the worst of bath was\\nthe number of its plain women.  he did not mean to say that there were\\nno pretty women, but the number of the plain was out of all proportion.\\nhe had frequently observed, as he walked, that one handsome face\\nwould be followed by thirty, or five-and-thirty frights; and once,\\nas he had stood in a shop on bond street, he had counted\\neighty-seven women go by, one after another, without there being\\na tolerable face among them.  it had been a frosty morning,\\nto be sure, a sharp frost, which hardly one woman in a thousand\\ncould stand the test of.  but still, there certainly were\\na dreadful multitude of ugly women in bath; and as for the men!\\nthey were infinitely worse.  such scarecrows as the streets were full of!\\nit was evident how little the women were used to the sight of anything\\ntolerable, by the effect which a man of decent appearance produced.\\nhe had never walked anywhere arm-in-arm with colonel wallis\\n(who was a fine military figure, though sandy-haired) without observing\\nthat every woman\\'s eye was upon him; every woman\\'s eye was sure to be\\nupon colonel wallis.\"  modest sir walter!  he was not allowed\\nto escape, however.  his daughter and mrs clay united in hinting\\nthat colonel wallis\\'s companion might have as good a figure\\nas colonel wallis, and certainly was not sandy-haired.\\n\\n\"how is mary looking?\" said sir walter, in the height of his good humour.\\n\"the last time i saw her she had a red nose, but i hope that may not\\nhappen every day.\"\\n\\n\"oh! no, that must have been quite accidental.  in general she has been\\nin very good health and very good looks since michaelmas.\"\\n\\n\"if i thought it would not tempt her to go out in sharp winds,\\nand grow coarse, i would send her a new hat and pelisse.\"\\n\\nanne was considering whether she should venture to suggest that a gown,\\nor a cap, would not be liable to any such misuse, when a knock at the door\\nsuspended everything.  \"a knock at the door! and so late!\\nit was ten o\\'clock.  could it be mr elliot?  they knew he was to dine\\nin lansdown crescent.  it was possible that he might stop in his way home\\nto ask them how they did.  they could think of no one else.\\nmrs clay decidedly thought it mr elliot\\'s knock.\"  mrs clay was right.\\nwith all the state which a butler and foot-boy could give,\\nmr elliot was ushered into the room.\\n\\nit was the same, the very same man, with no difference but of dress.\\nanne drew a little back, while the others received his compliments,\\nand her sister his apologies for calling at so unusual an hour,\\nbut \"he could not be so near without wishing to know that neither she\\nnor her friend had taken cold the day before,\" &c. &c; which was\\nall as politely done, and as politely taken, as possible, but her part\\nmust follow then.  sir walter talked of his youngest daughter;\\n\"mr elliot must give him leave to present him to his youngest daughter\"\\n(there was no occasion for remembering mary); and anne, smiling and\\nblushing, very becomingly shewed to mr elliot the pretty features\\nwhich he had by no means forgotten, and instantly saw, with amusement\\nat his little start of surprise, that he had not been at all aware\\nof who she was.  he looked completely astonished, but not more astonished\\nthan pleased; his eyes brightened! and with the most perfect alacrity\\nhe welcomed the relationship, alluded to the past, and entreated\\nto be received as an acquaintance already.  he was quite as good-looking\\nas he had appeared at lyme, his countenance improved by speaking,\\nand his manners were so exactly what they ought to be, so polished,\\nso easy, so particularly agreeable, that she could compare them\\nin excellence to only one person\\'s manners.  they were not the same,\\nbut they were, perhaps, equally good.\\n\\nhe sat down with them, and improved their conversation very much.\\nthere could be no doubt of his being a sensible man.  ten minutes\\nwere enough to certify that.  his tone, his expressions,\\nhis choice of subject, his knowing where to stop; it was all\\nthe operation of a sensible, discerning mind.  as soon as he could,\\nhe began to talk to her of lyme, wanting to compare opinions\\nrespecting the place, but especially wanting to speak of the circumstance\\nof their happening to be guests in the same inn at the same time;\\nto give his own route, understand something of hers, and regret that\\nhe should have lost such an opportunity of paying his respects to her.\\nshe gave him a short account of her party and business at lyme.\\nhis regret increased as he listened.  he had spent his whole\\nsolitary evening in the room adjoining theirs; had heard voices,\\nmirth continually; thought they must be a most delightful set of people,\\nlonged to be with them, but certainly without the smallest suspicion\\nof his possessing the shadow of a right to introduce himself.\\nif he had but asked who the party were!  the name of musgrove would\\nhave told him enough.  \"well, it would serve to cure him of\\nan absurd practice of never asking a question at an inn,\\nwhich he had adopted, when quite a young man, on the principal\\nof its being very ungenteel to be curious.\\n\\n\"the notions of a young man of one or two and twenty,\" said he,\\n\"as to what is necessary in manners to make him quite the thing,\\nare more absurd, i believe, than those of any other set of beings\\nin the world.  the folly of the means they often employ\\nis only to be equalled by the folly of what they have in view.\"\\n\\nbut he must not be addressing his reflections to anne alone:\\nhe knew it; he was soon diffused again among the others,\\nand it was only at intervals that he could return to lyme.\\n\\nhis enquiries, however, produced at length an account of the scene\\nshe had been engaged in there, soon after his leaving the place.\\nhaving alluded to \"an accident,\"  he must hear the whole.\\nwhen he questioned, sir walter and elizabeth began to question also,\\nbut the difference in their manner of doing it could not be unfelt.\\nshe could only compare mr elliot to lady russell, in the wish\\nof really comprehending what had passed, and in the degree of concern\\nfor what she must have suffered in witnessing it.\\n\\nhe staid an hour with them.  the elegant little clock on the mantel-\\npiece had struck \"eleven with its silver sounds,\" and the watchman\\nwas beginning to be heard at a distance telling the same tale,\\nbefore mr elliot or any of them seemed to feel that he had been there long.\\n\\nanne could not have supposed it possible that her first evening in\\ncamden place could have passed so well!\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 16\\n\\n\\nthere was one point which anne, on returning to her family,\\nwould have been more thankful to ascertain even than mr elliot\\'s\\nbeing in love with elizabeth, which was, her father\\'s not being\\nin love with mrs clay; and she was very far from easy about it,\\nwhen she had been at home a few hours.  on going down to breakfast\\nthe next morning, she found there had just been a decent pretence\\non the lady\\'s side of meaning to leave them.  she could imagine mrs clay\\nto have said, that \"now miss anne was come, she could not suppose herself\\nat all wanted;\" for elizabeth was replying in a sort of whisper,\\n\"that must not be any reason, indeed.  i assure you i feel it none.\\nshe is nothing to me, compared with you;\"  and she was in full time\\nto hear her father say, \"my dear madam, this must not be.  as yet,\\nyou have seen nothing of bath.  you have been here only to be useful.\\nyou must not run away from us now.  you must stay to be acquainted\\nwith mrs wallis, the beautiful mrs wallis.  to your fine mind,\\ni well know the sight of beauty is a real gratification.\"\\n\\nhe spoke and looked so much in earnest, that anne was not surprised\\nto see mrs clay stealing a glance at elizabeth and herself.\\nher countenance, perhaps, might express some watchfulness;\\nbut the praise of the fine mind did not appear to excite a thought\\nin her sister.  the lady could not but yield to such joint entreaties,\\nand promise to stay.\\n\\nin the course of the same morning, anne and her father chancing to be\\nalone together, he began to compliment her on her improved looks;\\nhe thought her \"less thin in her person, in her cheeks; her skin,\\nher complexion, greatly improved; clearer, fresher.  had she been\\nusing any thing in particular?\"  \"no, nothing.\"  \"merely gowland,\"\\nhe supposed.  \"no, nothing at all.\"  \"ha! he was surprised at that;\"\\nand added, \"certainly you cannot do better than to continue as you are;\\nyou cannot be better than well; or i should recommend gowland,\\nthe constant use of gowland, during the spring months.  mrs clay has been\\nusing it at my recommendation, and you see what it has done for her.\\nyou see how it has carried away her freckles.\"\\n\\nif elizabeth could but have heard this!  such personal praise\\nmight have struck her, especially as it did not appear to anne\\nthat the freckles were at all lessened.  but everything must\\ntake its chance.  the evil of a marriage would be much diminished,\\nif elizabeth were also to marry.  as for herself, she might always\\ncommand a home with lady russell.\\n\\nlady russell\\'s composed mind and polite manners were put to some trial\\non this point, in her intercourse in camden place.  the sight of mrs clay\\nin such favour, and of anne so overlooked, was a perpetual provocation\\nto her there; and vexed her as much when she was away, as a person in bath\\nwho drinks the water, gets all the new publications, and has\\na very large acquaintance, has time to be vexed.\\n\\nas mr elliot became known to her, she grew more charitable,\\nor more indifferent, towards the others.  his manners were\\nan immediate recommendation; and on conversing with him she found\\nthe solid so fully supporting the superficial, that she was at first,\\nas she told anne, almost ready to exclaim, \"can this be mr elliot?\"\\nand could not seriously picture to herself a more agreeable\\nor estimable man.  everything united in him; good understanding,\\ncorrect opinions, knowledge of the world, and a warm heart.\\nhe had strong feelings of family attachment and family honour,\\nwithout pride or weakness; he lived with the liberality of a man of fortune,\\nwithout display; he judged for himself in everything essential,\\nwithout defying public opinion in any point of worldly decorum.\\nhe was steady, observant, moderate, candid; never run away with by spirits\\nor by selfishness, which fancied itself strong feeling; and yet,\\nwith a sensibility to what was amiable and lovely, and a value\\nfor all the felicities of domestic life, which characters of\\nfancied enthusiasm and violent agitation seldom really possess.\\nshe was sure that he had not been happy in marriage.  colonel wallis\\nsaid it, and lady russell saw it; but it had been no unhappiness\\nto sour his mind, nor (she began pretty soon to suspect) to prevent his\\nthinking of a second choice.  her satisfaction in mr elliot\\noutweighed all the plague of mrs clay.\\n\\nit was now some years since anne had begun to learn that she\\nand her excellent friend could sometimes think differently;\\nand it did not surprise her, therefore, that lady russell\\nshould see nothing suspicious or inconsistent, nothing to require\\nmore motives than appeared, in mr elliot\\'s great desire of a reconciliation.\\nin lady russell\\'s view, it was perfectly natural that mr elliot,\\nat a mature time of life, should feel it a most desirable object,\\nand what would very generally recommend him among all sensible people,\\nto be on good terms with the head of his family; the simplest process\\nin the world of time upon a head naturally clear, and only erring\\nin the heyday of youth.  anne presumed, however, still to smile about it,\\nand at last to mention \"elizabeth.\"  lady russell listened, and looked,\\nand made only this cautious reply:--\"elizabeth! very well;\\ntime will explain.\"\\n\\nit was a reference to the future, which anne, after a little observation,\\nfelt she must submit to.  she could determine nothing at present.\\nin that house elizabeth must be first; and she was in the habit\\nof such general observance as \"miss elliot,\" that any particularity\\nof attention seemed almost impossible.  mr elliot, too,\\nit must be remembered, had not been a widower seven months.\\na little delay on his side might be very excusable.  in fact,\\nanne could never see the crape round his hat, without fearing that\\nshe was the inexcusable one, in attributing to him such imaginations;\\nfor though his marriage had not been very happy, still it had existed\\nso many years that she could not comprehend a very rapid recovery\\nfrom the awful impression of its being dissolved.\\n\\nhowever it might end, he was without any question their\\npleasantest acquaintance in bath:  she saw nobody equal to him;\\nand it was a great indulgence now and then to talk to him about lyme,\\nwhich he seemed to have as lively a wish to see again, and to see more of,\\nas herself.  they went through the particulars of their first meeting\\na great many times.  he gave her to understand that he had\\nlooked at her with some earnestness.  she knew it well;\\nand she remembered another person\\'s look also.\\n\\nthey did not always think alike.  his value for rank and connexion\\nshe perceived was greater than hers.  it was not merely complaisance,\\nit must be a liking to the cause, which made him enter warmly\\ninto her father and sister\\'s solicitudes on a subject which\\nshe thought unworthy to excite them.  the bath paper one morning\\nannounced the arrival of the dowager viscountess dalrymple,\\nand her daughter, the honourable miss carteret; and all the comfort\\nof no.--, camden place, was swept away for many days; for the dalrymples\\n(in anne\\'s opinion, most unfortunately) were cousins of the elliots;\\nand the agony was how to introduce themselves properly.\\n\\nanne had never seen her father and sister before in contact with nobility,\\nand she must acknowledge herself disappointed.  she had hoped\\nbetter things from their high ideas of their own situation in life,\\nand was reduced to form a wish which she had never foreseen;\\na wish that they had more pride; for \"our cousins lady dalrymple\\nand miss carteret;\" \"our cousins, the dalrymples,\" sounded in her ears\\nall day long.\\n\\nsir walter had once been in company with the late viscount,\\nbut had never seen any of the rest of the family; and the difficulties\\nof the case arose from there having been a suspension of all intercourse\\nby letters of ceremony, ever since the death of that said late viscount,\\nwhen, in consequence of a dangerous illness of sir walter\\'s\\nat the same time, there had been an unlucky omission at kellynch.\\nno letter of condolence had been sent to ireland.  the neglect\\nhad been visited on the head of the sinner; for when poor lady elliot\\ndied herself, no letter of condolence was received at kellynch,\\nand, consequently, there was but too much reason to apprehend\\nthat the dalrymples considered the relationship as closed.\\nhow to have this anxious business set to rights, and be admitted\\nas cousins again, was the question:  and it was a question which,\\nin a more rational manner, neither lady russell nor mr elliot\\nthought unimportant.  \"family connexions were always worth preserving,\\ngood company always worth seeking; lady dalrymple had taken a house,\\nfor three months, in laura place, and would be living in style.\\nshe had been at bath the year before, and lady russell had heard her\\nspoken of as a charming woman.  it was very desirable that\\nthe connexion should be renewed, if it could be done, without any\\ncompromise of propriety on the side of the elliots.\"\\n\\nsir walter, however, would choose his own means, and at last wrote\\na very fine letter of ample explanation, regret, and entreaty,\\nto his right honourable cousin.  neither lady russell nor mr elliot\\ncould admire the letter; but it did all that was wanted,\\nin bringing three lines of scrawl from the dowager viscountess.\\n\"she was very much honoured, and should be happy in their acquaintance.\"\\nthe toils of the business were over, the sweets began.  they visited\\nin laura place, they had the cards of dowager viscountess dalrymple,\\nand the honourable miss carteret, to be arranged wherever they might\\nbe most visible:  and \"our cousins in laura place,\"--\"our cousin,\\nlady dalrymple and miss carteret,\" were talked of to everybody.\\n\\nanne was ashamed.  had lady dalrymple and her daughter even been\\nvery agreeable, she would still have been ashamed of the agitation\\nthey created, but they were nothing.  there was no superiority of manner,\\naccomplishment, or understanding.  lady dalrymple had acquired\\nthe name of \"a charming woman,\" because she had a smile and a civil answer\\nfor everybody.  miss carteret, with still less to say, was so plain\\nand so awkward, that she would never have been tolerated in camden place\\nbut for her birth.\\n\\nlady russell confessed she had expected something better; but yet\\n\"it was an acquaintance worth having;\" and when anne ventured to speak\\nher opinion of them to mr elliot, he agreed to their being nothing\\nin themselves, but still maintained that, as a family connexion,\\nas good company, as those who would collect good company around them,\\nthey had their value.  anne smiled and said,\\n\\n\"my idea of good company, mr elliot, is the company of clever,\\nwell-informed people, who have a great deal of conversation;\\nthat is what i call good company.\"\\n\\n\"you are mistaken,\" said he gently, \"that is not good company;\\nthat is the best.  good company requires only birth, education,\\nand manners, and with regard to education is not very nice.\\nbirth and good manners are essential; but a little learning is\\nby no means a dangerous thing in good company; on the contrary,\\nit will do very well.  my cousin anne shakes her head.\\nshe is not satisfied.  she is fastidious.  my dear cousin\"\\n(sitting down by her), \"you have a better right to be fastidious\\nthan almost any other woman i know; but will it answer?\\nwill it make you happy?  will it not be wiser to accept the society\\nof those good ladies in laura place, and enjoy all the advantages\\nof the connexion as far as possible?  you may depend upon it,\\nthat they will move in the first set in bath this winter,\\nand as rank is rank, your being known to be related to them\\nwill have its use in fixing your family (our family let me say)\\nin that degree of consideration which we must all wish for.\"\\n\\n\"yes,\" sighed anne, \"we shall, indeed, be known to be related to them!\"\\nthen recollecting herself, and not wishing to be answered, she added,\\n\"i certainly do think there has been by far too much trouble taken\\nto procure the acquaintance.  i suppose\" (smiling) \"i have more pride\\nthan any of you; but i confess it does vex me, that we should be\\nso solicitous to have the relationship acknowledged, which we may\\nbe very sure is a matter of perfect indifference to them.\"\\n\\n\"pardon me, dear cousin, you are unjust in your own claims.\\nin london, perhaps, in your present quiet style of living,\\nit might be as you say:  but in bath; sir walter elliot and his family\\nwill always be worth knowing:  always acceptable as acquaintance.\"\\n\\n\"well,\" said anne, \"i certainly am proud, too proud to enjoy a welcome\\nwhich depends so entirely upon place.\"\\n\\n\"i love your indignation,\" said he; \"it is very natural.\\nbut here you are in bath, and the object is to be established here\\nwith all the credit and dignity which ought to belong to sir walter elliot.\\nyou talk of being proud; i am called proud, i know, and i shall not wish\\nto believe myself otherwise; for our pride, if investigated,\\nwould have the same object, i have no doubt, though the kind may seem\\na little different.  in one point, i am sure, my dear cousin,\"\\n(he continued, speaking lower, though there was no one else in the room)\\n\"in one point, i am sure, we must feel alike.  we must feel that\\nevery addition to your father\\'s society, among his equals or superiors,\\nmay be of use in diverting his thoughts from those who are beneath him.\"\\n\\nhe looked, as he spoke, to the seat which mrs clay had been\\nlately occupying:  a sufficient explanation of what he particularly meant;\\nand though anne could not believe in their having the same sort of pride,\\nshe was pleased with him for not liking mrs clay; and her conscience\\nadmitted that his wishing to promote her father\\'s getting\\ngreat acquaintance was more than excusable in the view of defeating her.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 17\\n\\n\\nwhile sir walter and elizabeth were assiduously pushing their\\ngood fortune in laura place, anne was renewing an acquaintance\\nof a very different description.\\n\\nshe had called on her former governess, and had heard from her\\nof there being an old school-fellow in bath, who had the two strong claims\\non her attention of past kindness and present suffering.  miss hamilton,\\nnow mrs smith, had shewn her kindness in one of those periods of her life\\nwhen it had been most valuable.  anne had gone unhappy to school,\\ngrieving for the loss of a mother whom she had dearly loved,\\nfeeling her separation from home, and suffering as a girl of fourteen,\\nof strong sensibility and not high spirits, must suffer at such a time;\\nand miss hamilton, three years older than herself, but still from the want\\nof near relations and a settled home, remaining another year at school,\\nhad been useful and good to her in a way which had considerably lessened\\nher misery, and could never be remembered with indifference.\\n\\nmiss hamilton had left school, had married not long afterwards,\\nwas said to have married a man of fortune, and this was all\\nthat anne had known of her, till now that their governess\\'s account\\nbrought her situation forward in a more decided but very different form.\\n\\nshe was a widow and poor.  her husband had been extravagant;\\nand at his death, about two years before, had left his affairs\\ndreadfully involved.  she had had difficulties of every sort\\nto contend with, and in addition to these distresses had been afflicted\\nwith a severe rheumatic fever, which, finally settling in her legs,\\nhad made her for the present a cripple.  she had come to bath\\non that account, and was now in lodgings near the hot baths,\\nliving in a very humble way, unable even to afford herself\\nthe comfort of a servant, and of course almost excluded from society.\\n\\ntheir mutual friend answered for the satisfaction which a visit\\nfrom miss elliot would give mrs smith, and anne therefore\\nlost no time in going.  she mentioned nothing of what she had heard,\\nor what she intended, at home.  it would excite no proper interest there.\\nshe only consulted lady russell, who entered thoroughly into her sentiments,\\nand was most happy to convey her as near to mrs smith\\'s lodgings\\nin westgate buildings, as anne chose to be taken.\\n\\nthe visit was paid, their acquaintance re-established, their interest\\nin each other more than re-kindled.  the first ten minutes\\nhad its awkwardness and its emotion.  twelve years were gone\\nsince they had parted, and each presented a somewhat different person\\nfrom what the other had imagined.  twelve years had changed anne\\nfrom the blooming, silent, unformed girl of fifteen, to the elegant\\nlittle woman of seven-and-twenty, with every beauty except bloom,\\nand with manners as consciously right as they were invariably gentle;\\nand twelve years had transformed the fine-looking, well-grown miss hamilton,\\nin all the glow of health and confidence of superiority, into a poor,\\ninfirm, helpless widow, receiving the visit of her former protegee\\nas a favour; but all that was uncomfortable in the meeting had soon\\npassed away, and left only the interesting charm of remembering\\nformer partialities and talking over old times.\\n\\nanne found in mrs smith the good sense and agreeable manners which\\nshe had almost ventured to depend on, and a disposition to converse\\nand be cheerful beyond her expectation.  neither the dissipations\\nof the past--and she had lived very much in the world--nor the restrictions\\nof the present, neither sickness nor sorrow seemed to have\\nclosed her heart or ruined her spirits.\\n\\nin the course of a second visit she talked with great openness,\\nand anne\\'s astonishment increased.  she could scarcely imagine\\na more cheerless situation in itself than mrs smith\\'s.  she had been\\nvery fond of her husband:  she had buried him.  she had been\\nused to affluence:  it was gone.  she had no child to connect her\\nwith life and happiness again, no relations to assist in the arrangement\\nof perplexed affairs, no health to make all the rest supportable.\\nher accommodations were limited to a noisy parlour, and a dark bedroom\\nbehind, with no possibility of moving from one to the other without\\nassistance, which there was only one servant in the house to afford,\\nand she never quitted the house but to be conveyed into the warm bath.\\nyet, in spite of all this, anne had reason to believe that she had\\nmoments only of languor and depression, to hours of occupation\\nand enjoyment.  how could it be?  she watched, observed, reflected,\\nand finally determined that this was not a case of fortitude\\nor of resignation only.  a submissive spirit might be patient,\\na strong understanding would supply resolution, but here was something more;\\nhere was that elasticity of mind, that disposition to be comforted,\\nthat power of turning readily from evil to good, and of finding employment\\nwhich carried her out of herself, which was from nature alone.\\nit was the choicest gift of heaven; and anne viewed her friend\\nas one of those instances in which, by a merciful appointment,\\nit seems designed to counterbalance almost every other want.\\n\\nthere had been a time, mrs smith told her, when her spirits\\nhad nearly failed.  she could not call herself an invalid now,\\ncompared with her state on first reaching bath.  then she had, indeed,\\nbeen a pitiable object; for she had caught cold on the journey,\\nand had hardly taken possession of her lodgings before she was again\\nconfined to her bed and suffering under severe and constant pain;\\nand all this among strangers, with the absolute necessity of having\\na regular nurse, and finances at that moment particularly unfit\\nto meet any extraordinary expense.  she had weathered it, however,\\nand could truly say that it had done her good.  it had increased\\nher comforts by making her feel herself to be in good hands.\\nshe had seen too much of the world, to expect sudden or disinterested\\nattachment anywhere, but her illness had proved to her that her landlady\\nhad a character to preserve, and would not use her ill; and she had been\\nparticularly fortunate in her nurse, as a sister of her landlady,\\na nurse by profession, and who had always a home in that house\\nwhen unemployed, chanced to be at liberty just in time to attend her.\\n\"and she,\" said mrs smith, \"besides nursing me most admirably,\\nhas really proved an invaluable acquaintance.  as soon as i could\\nuse my hands she taught me to knit, which has been a great amusement;\\nand she put me in the way of making these little thread-cases,\\npin-cushions and card-racks, which you always find me so busy about,\\nand which supply me with the means of doing a little good\\nto one or two very poor families in this neighbourhood.\\nshe had a large acquaintance, of course professionally, among those\\nwho can afford to buy, and she disposes of my merchandise.\\nshe always takes the right time for applying.  everybody\\'s heart is open,\\nyou know, when they have recently escaped from severe pain,\\nor are recovering the blessing of health, and nurse rooke\\nthoroughly understands when to speak.  she is a shrewd, intelligent,\\nsensible woman.  hers is a line for seeing human nature; and she has\\na fund of good sense and observation, which, as a companion, make her\\ninfinitely superior to thousands of those who having only received\\n`the best education in the world,\\' know nothing worth attending to.\\ncall it gossip, if you will, but when nurse rooke has half an hour\\'s\\nleisure to bestow on me, she is sure to have something to relate\\nthat is entertaining and profitable:  something that makes one\\nknow one\\'s species better.  one likes to hear what is going on,\\nto be au fait as to the newest modes of being trifling and silly.\\nto me, who live so much alone, her conversation, i assure you, is a treat.\"\\n\\nanne, far from wishing to cavil at the pleasure, replied,\\n\"i can easily believe it.  women of that class have great opportunities,\\nand if they are intelligent may be well worth listening to.\\nsuch varieties of human nature as they are in the habit of witnessing!\\nand it is not merely in its follies, that they are well read;\\nfor they see it occasionally under every circumstance that can be\\nmost interesting or affecting.  what instances must pass before them\\nof ardent, disinterested, self-denying attachment, of heroism, fortitude,\\npatience, resignation:  of all the conflicts and all the sacrifices\\nthat ennoble us most.  a sick chamber may often furnish\\nthe worth of volumes.\"\\n\\n\"yes,\" said mrs smith more doubtingly, \"sometimes it may,\\nthough i fear its lessons are not often in the elevated style you describe.\\nhere and there, human nature may be great in times of trial;\\nbut generally speaking, it is its weakness and not its strength\\nthat appears in a sick chamber:  it is selfishness and impatience\\nrather than generosity and fortitude, that one hears of.\\nthere is so little real friendship in the world! and unfortunately\"\\n(speaking low and tremulously) \"there are so many who forget\\nto think seriously till it is almost too late.\"\\n\\nanne saw the misery of such feelings.  the husband had not been\\nwhat he ought, and the wife had been led among that part of mankind\\nwhich made her think worse of the world than she hoped it deserved.\\nit was but a passing emotion however with mrs smith; she shook it off,\\nand soon added in a different tone--\\n\\n\"i do not suppose the situation my friend mrs rooke is in at present,\\nwill furnish much either to interest or edify me.  she is only nursing\\nmrs wallis of marlborough buildings; a mere pretty, silly, expensive,\\nfashionable woman, i believe; and of course will have nothing to report\\nbut of lace and finery.  i mean to make my profit of mrs wallis, however.\\nshe has plenty of money, and i intend she shall buy all\\nthe high-priced things i have in hand now.\"\\n\\nanne had called several times on her friend, before the existence\\nof such a person was known in camden place.  at last, it became necessary\\nto speak of her. sir walter, elizabeth and mrs clay, returned one morning\\nfrom laura place, with a sudden invitation from lady dalrymple\\nfor the same evening, and anne was already engaged, to spend that evening\\nin westgate buildings.  she was not sorry for the excuse.\\nthey were only asked, she was sure, because lady dalrymple being\\nkept at home by a bad cold, was glad to make use of the relationship\\nwhich had been so pressed on her; and she declined on her own account\\nwith great alacrity--\"she was engaged to spend the evening\\nwith an old schoolfellow.\"  they were not much interested in anything\\nrelative to anne; but still there were questions enough asked,\\nto make it understood what this old schoolfellow was; and elizabeth\\nwas disdainful, and sir walter severe.\\n\\n\"westgate buildings!\" said he, \"and who is miss anne elliot\\nto be visiting in westgate buildings?  a mrs smith.  a widow mrs smith;\\nand who was her husband?  one of five thousand mr smiths whose names\\nare to be met with everywhere.  and what is her attraction?\\nthat she is old and sickly.  upon my word, miss anne elliot,\\nyou have the most extraordinary taste!  everything that revolts\\nother people, low company, paltry rooms, foul air, disgusting associations\\nare inviting to you.  but surely you may put off this old lady\\ntill to-morrow:  she is not so near her end, i presume,\\nbut that she may hope to see another day.  what is her age?  forty?\"\\n\\n\"no, sir, she is not one-and-thirty; but i do not think i can\\nput off my engagement, because it is the only evening for some time\\nwhich will at once suit her and myself.  she goes into the warm bath\\nto-morrow, and for the rest of the week, you know, we are engaged.\"\\n\\n\"but what does lady russell think of this acquaintance?\" asked elizabeth.\\n\\n\"she sees nothing to blame in it,\" replied anne; \"on the contrary,\\nshe approves it, and has generally taken me when i have\\ncalled on mrs smith.\\n\\n\"westgate buildings must have been rather surprised by the appearance\\nof a carriage drawn up near its pavement,\" observed sir walter.\\n\"sir henry russell\\'s widow, indeed, has no honours to distinguish her arms,\\nbut still it is a handsome equipage, and no doubt is well known\\nto convey a miss elliot.  a widow mrs smith lodging in westgate buildings!\\na poor widow barely able to live, between thirty and forty;\\na mere mrs smith, an every-day mrs smith, of all people and all names\\nin the world, to be the chosen friend of miss anne elliot,\\nand to be preferred by her to her own family connections among the nobility\\nof england and ireland!  mrs smith!  such a name!\"\\n\\nmrs clay, who had been present while all this passed, now thought it\\nadvisable to leave the room, and anne could have said much,\\nand did long to say a little in defence of her friend\\'s\\nnot very dissimilar claims to theirs, but her sense of personal respect\\nto her father prevented her.  she made no reply.  she left it\\nto himself to recollect, that mrs smith was not the only widow\\nin bath between thirty and forty, with little to live on,\\nand no surname of dignity.\\n\\nanne kept her appointment; the others kept theirs, and of course\\nshe heard the next morning that they had had a delightful evening.\\nshe had been the only one of the set absent, for sir walter\\nand elizabeth had not only been quite at her ladyship\\'s service themselves,\\nbut had actually been happy to be employed by her in collecting others,\\nand had been at the trouble of inviting both lady russell and mr elliot;\\nand mr elliot had made a point of leaving colonel wallis early,\\nand lady russell had fresh arranged all her evening engagements\\nin order to wait on her.  anne had the whole history of all that\\nsuch an evening could supply from lady russell.  to her,\\nits greatest interest must be, in having been very much talked of\\nbetween her friend and mr elliot; in having been wished for, regretted,\\nand at the same time honoured for staying away in such a cause.\\nher kind, compassionate visits to this old schoolfellow,\\nsick and reduced, seemed to have quite delighted mr elliot.\\nhe thought her a most extraordinary young woman; in her temper, manners,\\nmind, a model of female excellence.  he could meet even lady russell\\nin a discussion of her merits; and anne could not be given to understand\\nso much by her friend, could not know herself to be so highly rated\\nby a sensible man, without many of those agreeable sensations\\nwhich her friend meant to create.\\n\\nlady russell was now perfectly decided in her opinion of mr elliot.\\nshe was as much convinced of his meaning to gain anne in time as of\\nhis deserving her, and was beginning to calculate the number of weeks\\nwhich would free him from all the remaining restraints of widowhood,\\nand leave him at liberty to exert his most open powers of pleasing.\\nshe would not speak to anne with half the certainty she felt on the subject,\\nshe would venture on little more than hints of what might be hereafter,\\nof a possible attachment on his side, of the desirableness of the alliance,\\nsupposing such attachment to be real and returned.  anne heard her,\\nand made no violent exclamations; she only smiled, blushed,\\nand gently shook her head.\\n\\n\"i am no match-maker, as you well know,\" said lady russell,\\n\"being much too well aware of the uncertainty of all human events\\nand calculations.  i only mean that if mr elliot should some time hence\\npay his addresses to you, and if you should be disposed to accept him,\\ni think there would be every possibility of your being happy together.\\na most suitable connection everybody must consider it, but i think\\nit might be a very happy one.\"\\n\\n\"mr elliot is an exceedingly agreeable man, and in many respects\\ni think highly of him,\" said anne; \"but we should not suit.\"\\n\\nlady russell let this pass, and only said in rejoinder, \"i own that\\nto be able to regard you as the future mistress of kellynch,\\nthe future lady elliot, to look forward and see you occupying\\nyour dear mother\\'s place, succeeding to all her rights,\\nand all her popularity, as well as to all her virtues, would be\\nthe highest possible gratification to me.  you are your mother\\'s self\\nin countenance and disposition; and if i might be allowed to fancy you\\nsuch as she was, in situation and name, and home, presiding and blessing\\nin the same spot, and only superior to her in being more highly valued!\\nmy dearest anne, it would give me more delight than is often felt\\nat my time of life!\"\\n\\nanne was obliged to turn away, to rise, to walk to a distant table,\\nand, leaning there in pretended employment, try to subdue the feelings\\nthis picture excited.  for a few moments her imagination and her heart\\nwere bewitched.  the idea of becoming what her mother had been;\\nof having the precious name of \"lady elliot\" first revived in herself;\\nof being restored to kellynch, calling it her home again,\\nher home for ever, was a charm which she could not immediately resist.\\nlady russell said not another word, willing to leave the matter\\nto its own operation; and believing that, could mr elliot at that moment\\nwith propriety have spoken for himself!--she believed, in short,\\nwhat anne did not believe.  the same image of mr elliot speaking\\nfor himself brought anne to composure again.  the charm of kellynch\\nand of \"lady elliot\" all faded away.  she never could accept him.\\nand it was not only that her feelings were still adverse to any man\\nsave one; her judgement, on a serious consideration of the possibilities\\nof such a case was against mr elliot.\\n\\nthough they had now been acquainted a month, she could not be satisfied\\nthat she really knew his character.  that he was a sensible man,\\nan agreeable man, that he talked well, professed good opinions,\\nseemed to judge properly and as a man of principle, this was all\\nclear enough.  he certainly knew what was right, nor could she fix\\non any one article of moral duty evidently transgressed; but yet she would\\nhave been afraid to answer for his conduct.  she distrusted the past,\\nif not the present.  the names which occasionally dropt\\nof former associates, the allusions to former practices and pursuits,\\nsuggested suspicions not favourable of what he had been.\\nshe saw that there had been bad habits; that sunday travelling\\nhad been a common thing; that there had been a period of his life\\n(and probably not a short one) when he had been, at least,\\ncareless in all serious matters; and, though he might now think\\nvery differently, who could answer for the true sentiments of a clever,\\ncautious man, grown old enough to appreciate a fair character?\\nhow could it ever be ascertained that his mind was truly cleansed?\\n\\nmr elliot was rational, discreet, polished, but he was not open.\\nthere was never any burst of feeling, any warmth of indignation or delight,\\nat the evil or good of others.  this, to anne, was a decided imperfection.\\nher early impressions were incurable.  she prized the frank,\\nthe open-hearted, the eager character beyond all others.\\nwarmth and enthusiasm did captivate her still.  she felt that she could\\nso much more depend upon the sincerity of those who sometimes looked\\nor said a careless or a hasty thing, than of those whose presence of mind\\nnever varied, whose tongue never slipped.\\n\\nmr elliot was too generally agreeable.  various as were the tempers\\nin her father\\'s house, he pleased them all.  he endured too well,\\nstood too well with every body.  he had spoken to her with some\\ndegree of openness of mrs clay; had appeared completely to see\\nwhat mrs clay was about, and to hold her in contempt; and yet\\nmrs clay found him as agreeable as any body.\\n\\nlady russell saw either less or more than her young friend,\\nfor she saw nothing to excite distrust.  she could not imagine\\na man more exactly what he ought to be than mr elliot; nor did she\\never enjoy a sweeter feeling than the hope of seeing him receive\\nthe hand of her beloved anne in kellynch church, in the course of\\nthe following autumn.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 18\\n\\n\\nit was the beginning of february; and anne, having been a month in bath,\\nwas growing very eager for news from uppercross and lyme.\\nshe wanted to hear much more than mary had communicated.\\nit was three weeks since she had heard at all.  she only knew\\nthat henrietta was at home again; and that louisa, though considered to be\\nrecovering fast, was still in lyme; and she was thinking of them all\\nvery intently one evening, when a thicker letter than usual from mary\\nwas delivered to her; and, to quicken the pleasure and surprise,\\nwith admiral and mrs croft\\'s compliments.\\n\\nthe crofts must be in bath!  a circumstance to interest her.\\nthey were people whom her heart turned to very naturally.\\n\\n\"what is this?\" cried sir walter.  \"the crofts have arrived in bath?\\nthe crofts who rent kellynch?  what have they brought you?\"\\n\\n\"a letter from uppercross cottage, sir.\"\\n\\n\"oh! those letters are convenient passports.  they secure an introduction.\\ni should have visited admiral croft, however, at any rate.\\ni know what is due to my tenant.\"\\n\\nanne could listen no longer; she could not even have told how\\nthe poor admiral\\'s complexion escaped; her letter engrossed her.\\nit had been begun several days back.\\n\\n\\n            \"february 1st.\\n\\n\"my dear anne,--i make no apology for my silence, because i know\\nhow little people think of letters in such a place as bath.\\nyou must be a great deal too happy to care for uppercross, which,\\nas you well know, affords little to write about.  we have had\\na very dull christmas; mr and mrs musgrove have not had one dinner party\\nall the holidays.  i do not reckon the hayters as anybody.\\nthe holidays, however, are over at last:  i believe no children ever had\\nsuch long ones.  i am sure i had not.  the house was cleared yesterday,\\nexcept of the little harvilles; but you will be surprised to hear\\nthey have never gone home.  mrs harville must be an odd mother\\nto part with them so long.  i do not understand it.  they are\\nnot at all nice children, in my opinion; but mrs musgrove seems to\\nlike them quite as well, if not better, than her grandchildren.\\nwhat dreadful weather we have had!  it may not be felt in bath,\\nwith your nice pavements; but in the country it is of some consequence.\\ni have not had a creature call on me since the second week in january,\\nexcept charles hayter, who had been calling much oftener than was welcome.\\nbetween ourselves, i think it a great pity henrietta did not remain at lyme\\nas long as louisa; it would have kept her a little out of his way.\\nthe carriage is gone to-day, to bring louisa and the harvilles to-morrow.\\nwe are not asked to dine with them, however, till the day after,\\nmrs musgrove is so afraid of her being fatigued by the journey,\\nwhich is not very likely, considering the care that will be taken of her;\\nand it would be much more convenient to me to dine there to-morrow.\\ni am glad you find mr elliot so agreeable, and wish i could be acquainted\\nwith him too; but i have my usual luck:  i am always out of the way\\nwhen any thing desirable is going on; always the last of my family\\nto be noticed.  what an immense time mrs clay has been staying\\nwith elizabeth!  does she never mean to go away?  but perhaps\\nif she were to leave the room vacant, we might not be invited.\\nlet me know what you think of this.  i do not expect my children\\nto be asked, you know.  i can leave them at the great house very well,\\nfor a month or six weeks.  i have this moment heard that the crofts\\nare going to bath almost immediately; they think the admiral gouty.\\ncharles heard it quite by chance; they have not had the civility\\nto give me any notice, or of offering to take anything.\\ni do not think they improve at all as neighbours.  we see nothing of them,\\nand this is really an instance of gross inattention.  charles joins me\\nin love, and everything proper.  yours affectionately,\\n\\n  \"mary m---.\\n\\n\"i am sorry to say that i am very far from well; and jemima has\\njust told me that the butcher says there is a bad sore-throat\\nvery much about.  i dare say i shall catch it; and my sore-throats,\\nyou know, are always worse than anybody\\'s.\"\\n\\n\\nso ended the first part, which had been afterwards put into an envelope,\\ncontaining nearly as much more.\\n\\n\\n\"i kept my letter open, that i might send you word how louisa\\nbore her journey, and now i am extremely glad i did, having a great deal\\nto add.  in the first place, i had a note from mrs croft yesterday,\\noffering to convey anything to you; a very kind, friendly note indeed,\\naddressed to me, just as it ought; i shall therefore be able to\\nmake my letter as long as i like.  the admiral does not seem very ill,\\nand i sincerely hope bath will do him all the good he wants.\\ni shall be truly glad to have them back again.  our neighbourhood\\ncannot spare such a pleasant family.  but now for louisa.\\ni have something to communicate that will astonish you not a little.\\nshe and the harvilles came on tuesday very safely, and in the evening\\nwe went to ask her how she did, when we were rather surprised\\nnot to find captain benwick of the party, for he had been invited\\nas well as the harvilles; and what do you think was the reason?\\nneither more nor less than his being in love with louisa,\\nand not choosing to venture to uppercross till he had had an answer\\nfrom mr musgrove; for it was all settled between him and her\\nbefore she came away, and he had written to her father by captain harville.\\ntrue, upon my honour!  are not you astonished?  i shall be surprised\\nat least if you ever received a hint of it, for i never did.\\nmrs musgrove protests solemnly that she knew nothing of the matter.\\nwe are all very well pleased, however, for though it is not equal to her\\nmarrying captain wentworth, it is infinitely better than charles hayter;\\nand mr musgrove has written his consent, and captain benwick\\nis expected to-day.  mrs harville says her husband feels a good deal\\non his poor sister\\'s account; but, however, louisa is a great favourite\\nwith both.  indeed, mrs harville and i quite agree that we love her\\nthe better for having nursed her.  charles wonders what captain wentworth\\nwill say; but if you remember, i never thought him attached to louisa;\\ni never could see anything of it.  and this is the end, you see,\\nof captain benwick\\'s being supposed to be an admirer of yours.\\nhow charles could take such a thing into his head was always\\nincomprehensible to me.  i hope he will be more agreeable now.\\ncertainly not a great match for louisa musgrove, but a million times better\\nthan marrying among the hayters.\"\\n\\n\\nmary need not have feared her sister\\'s being in any degree prepared\\nfor the news.  she had never in her life been more astonished.\\ncaptain benwick and louisa musgrove!  it was almost too wonderful\\nfor belief, and it was with the greatest effort that she could remain\\nin the room, preserve an air of calmness, and answer the common questions\\nof the moment.  happily for her, they were not many.  sir walter\\nwanted to know whether the crofts travelled with four horses,\\nand whether they were likely to be situated in such a part of bath\\nas it might suit miss elliot and himself to visit in; but had\\nlittle curiosity beyond.\\n\\n\"how is mary?\" said elizabeth; and without waiting for an answer,\\n\"and pray what brings the crofts to bath?\"\\n\\n\"they come on the admiral\\'s account.  he is thought to be gouty.\"\\n\\n\"gout and decrepitude!\" said sir walter.  \"poor old gentleman.\"\\n\\n\"have they any acquaintance here?\" asked elizabeth.\\n\\n\"i do not know; but i can hardly suppose that, at admiral croft\\'s\\ntime of life, and in his profession, he should not have many acquaintance\\nin such a place as this.\"\\n\\n\"i suspect,\" said sir walter coolly, \"that admiral croft\\nwill be best known in bath as the renter of kellynch hall.\\nelizabeth, may we venture to present him and his wife in laura place?\"\\n\\n\"oh, no! i think not.  situated as we are with lady dalrymple, cousins,\\nwe ought to be very careful not to embarrass her with acquaintance\\nshe might not approve.  if we were not related, it would not signify;\\nbut as cousins, she would feel scrupulous as to any proposal of ours.\\nwe had better leave the crofts to find their own level.\\nthere are several odd-looking men walking about here, who,\\ni am told, are sailors.  the crofts will associate with them.\"\\n\\nthis was sir walter and elizabeth\\'s share of interest in the letter;\\nwhen mrs clay had paid her tribute of more decent attention,\\nin an enquiry after mrs charles musgrove, and her fine little boys,\\nanne was at liberty.\\n\\nin her own room, she tried to comprehend it.  well might charles wonder\\nhow captain wentworth would feel!  perhaps he had quitted the field,\\nhad given louisa up, had ceased to love, had found he did not love her.\\nshe could not endure the idea of treachery or levity, or anything\\nakin to ill usage between him and his friend.  she could not endure\\nthat such a friendship as theirs should be severed unfairly.\\n\\ncaptain benwick and louisa musgrove!  the high-spirited,\\njoyous-talking louisa musgrove, and the dejected, thinking,\\nfeeling, reading, captain benwick, seemed each of them everything\\nthat would not suit the other.  their minds most dissimilar!\\nwhere could have been the attraction?  the answer soon presented itself.\\nit had been in situation.  they had been thrown together several weeks;\\nthey had been living in the same small family party:  since henrietta\\'s\\ncoming away, they must have been depending almost entirely on each other,\\nand louisa, just recovering from illness, had been in an interesting state,\\nand captain benwick was not inconsolable.  that was a point which anne\\nhad not been able to avoid suspecting before; and instead of drawing\\nthe same conclusion as mary, from the present course of events,\\nthey served only to confirm the idea of his having felt some\\ndawning of tenderness toward herself.  she did not mean, however,\\nto derive much more from it to gratify her vanity, than mary\\nmight have allowed.  she was persuaded that any tolerably pleasing\\nyoung woman who had listened and seemed to feel for him would have\\nreceived the same compliment.  he had an affectionate heart.\\nhe must love somebody.\\n\\nshe saw no reason against their being happy.  louisa had fine\\nnaval fervour to begin with, and they would soon grow more alike.\\nhe would gain cheerfulness, and she would learn to be an enthusiast\\nfor scott and lord byron; nay, that was probably learnt already;\\nof course they had fallen in love over poetry.  the idea of\\nlouisa musgrove turned into a person of literary taste,\\nand sentimental reflection was amusing, but she had no doubt\\nof its being so.  the day at lyme, the fall from the cobb,\\nmight influence her health, her nerves, her courage, her character to\\nthe end of her life, as thoroughly as it appeared to have\\ninfluenced her fate.\\n\\nthe conclusion of the whole was, that if the woman who had been sensible\\nof captain wentworth\\'s merits could be allowed to prefer another man,\\nthere was nothing in the engagement to excite lasting wonder;\\nand if captain wentworth lost no friend by it, certainly nothing\\nto be regretted.  no, it was not regret which made anne\\'s heart\\nbeat in spite of herself, and brought the colour into her cheeks\\nwhen she thought of captain wentworth unshackled and free.\\nshe had some feelings which she was ashamed to investigate.\\nthey were too much like joy, senseless joy!\\n\\nshe longed to see the crofts; but when the meeting took place,\\nit was evident that no rumour of the news had yet reached them.\\nthe visit of ceremony was paid and returned; and louisa musgrove\\nwas mentioned, and captain benwick, too, without even half a smile.\\n\\nthe crofts had placed themselves in lodgings in gay street,\\nperfectly to sir walter\\'s satisfaction.  he was not at all ashamed\\nof the acquaintance, and did, in fact, think and talk a great deal more\\nabout the admiral, than the admiral ever thought or talked about him.\\n\\nthe crofts knew quite as many people in bath as they wished for,\\nand considered their intercourse with the elliots as a mere matter of form,\\nand not in the least likely to afford them any pleasure.\\nthey brought with them their country habit of being almost always together.\\nhe was ordered to walk to keep off the gout, and mrs croft\\nseemed to go shares with him in everything, and to walk\\nfor her life to do him good.  anne saw them wherever she went.\\nlady russell took her out in her carriage almost every morning,\\nand she never failed to think of them, and never failed to see them.\\nknowing their feelings as she did, it was a most attractive picture\\nof happiness to her.  she always watched them as long as she could,\\ndelighted to fancy she understood what they might be talking of,\\nas they walked along in happy independence, or equally delighted\\nto see the admiral\\'s hearty shake of the hand when he encountered\\nan old friend, and observe their eagerness of conversation\\nwhen occasionally forming into a little knot of the navy, mrs croft\\nlooking as intelligent and keen as any of the officers around her.\\n\\nanne was too much engaged with lady russell to be often walking herself;\\nbut it so happened that one morning, about a week or ten days\\nafter the croft\\'s arrival, it suited her best to leave her friend,\\nor her friend\\'s carriage, in the lower part of the town,\\nand return alone to camden place, and in walking up milsom street\\nshe had the good fortune to meet with the admiral.  he was standing\\nby himself at a printshop window, with his hands behind him,\\nin earnest contemplation of some print, and she not only might have\\npassed him unseen, but was obliged to touch as well as address him\\nbefore she could catch his notice.  when he did perceive and\\nacknowledge her, however, it was done with all his usual frankness\\nand good humour.  \"ha! is it you?  thank you, thank you.\\nthis is treating me like a friend.  here i am, you see,\\nstaring at a picture.  i can never get by this shop without stopping.\\nbut what a thing here is, by way of a boat!  do look at it.\\ndid you ever see the like?  what queer fellows your fine painters must be,\\nto think that anybody would venture their lives in such a shapeless\\nold cockleshell as that?  and yet here are two gentlemen\\nstuck up in it mightily at their ease, and looking about them at the rocks\\nand mountains, as if they were not to be upset the next moment,\\nwhich they certainly must be.  i wonder where that boat was built!\"\\n(laughing heartily); \"i would not venture over a horsepond in it.\\nwell,\" (turning away), \"now, where are you bound?  can i go anywhere\\nfor you, or with you?  can i be of any use?\"\\n\\n\"none, i thank you, unless you will give me the pleasure of your company\\nthe little way our road lies together.  i am going home.\"\\n\\n\\n\"that i will, with all my heart, and farther, too.  yes, yes\\nwe will have a snug walk together, and i have something to tell you\\nas we go along.  there, take my arm; that\\'s right; i do not\\nfeel comfortable if i have not a woman there.  lord! what a boat it is!\"\\ntaking a last look at the picture, as they began to be in motion.\\n\\n\"did you say that you had something to tell me, sir?\"\\n\\n\"yes, i have, presently.  but here comes a friend, captain brigden;\\ni shall only say, `how d\\'ye do?\\' as we pass, however.  i shall not stop.\\n`how d\\'ye do?\\'  brigden stares to see anybody with me but my wife.\\nshe, poor soul, is tied by the leg.  she has a blister on one of her heels,\\nas large as a three-shilling piece.  if you look across the street,\\nyou will see admiral brand coming down and his brother.  shabby fellows,\\nboth of them!  i am glad they are not on this side of the way.\\nsophy cannot bear them.  they played me a pitiful trick once:\\ngot away with some of my best men.  i will tell you the whole story\\nanother time.  there comes old sir archibald drew and his grandson.\\nlook, he sees us; he kisses his hand to you; he takes you for my wife.\\nah! the peace has come too soon for that younker.  poor old sir archibald!\\nhow do you like bath, miss elliot?  it suits us very well.\\nwe are always meeting with some old friend or other; the streets\\nfull of them every morning; sure to have plenty of chat;\\nand then we get away from them all, and shut ourselves in our lodgings,\\nand draw in our chairs, and are snug as if we were at kellynch,\\nay, or as we used to be even at north yarmouth and deal.\\nwe do not like our lodgings here the worse, i can tell you,\\nfor putting us in mind of those we first had at north yarmouth.\\nthe wind blows through one of the cupboards just in the same way.\"\\n\\nwhen they were got a little farther, anne ventured to press again\\nfor what he had to communicate.  she hoped when clear of milsom street\\nto have her curiosity gratified; but she was still obliged to wait,\\nfor the admiral had made up his mind not to begin till they had\\ngained the greater space and quiet of belmont; and as she was\\nnot really mrs croft, she must let him have his own way.\\nas soon as they were fairly ascending belmont, he began--\\n\\n\"well, now you shall hear something that will surprise you.\\nbut first of all, you must tell me the name of the young lady\\ni am going to talk about.  that young lady, you know, that we have\\nall been so concerned for.  the miss musgrove, that all this has been\\nhappening to.  her christian name:  i always forget her christian name.\"\\n\\nanne had been ashamed to appear to comprehend so soon as she really\\ndid; but now she could safely suggest the name of \"louisa.\"\\n\\n\"ay, ay, miss louisa musgrove, that is the name.  i wish young ladies\\nhad not such a number of fine christian names.  i should never be out\\nif they were all sophys, or something of that sort.  well,\\nthis miss louisa, we all thought, you know, was to marry frederick.\\nhe was courting her week after week.  the only wonder was,\\nwhat they could be waiting for, till the business at lyme came;\\nthen, indeed, it was clear enough that they must wait till her brain\\nwas set to right.  but even then there was something odd in their\\nway of going on.  instead of staying at lyme, he went off to plymouth,\\nand then he went off to see edward.  when we came back from minehead\\nhe was gone down to edward\\'s, and there he has been ever since.\\nwe have seen nothing of him since november.  even sophy could\\nnot understand it.  but now, the matter has take the strangest turn of all;\\nfor this young lady, the same miss musgrove, instead of being\\nto marry frederick, is to marry james benwick.  you know james benwick.\"\\n\\n\"a little.  i am a little acquainted with captain benwick.\"\\n\\n\"well, she is to marry him.  nay, most likely they are married already,\\nfor i do not know what they should wait for.\"\\n\\n\"i thought captain benwick a very pleasing young man,\" said anne,\\n\"and i understand that he bears an excellent character.\"\\n\\n\"oh! yes, yes, there is not a word to be said against james benwick.\\nhe is only a commander, it is true, made last summer, and these are\\nbad times for getting on, but he has not another fault that i know of.\\nan excellent, good-hearted fellow, i assure you; a very active,\\nzealous officer too, which is more than you would think for, perhaps,\\nfor that soft sort of manner does not do him justice.\"\\n\\n\"indeed you are mistaken there, sir; i should never augur want of spirit\\nfrom captain benwick\\'s manners.  i thought them particularly pleasing,\\nand i will answer for it, they would generally please.\"\\n\\n\"well, well, ladies are the best judges; but james benwick is rather too\\npiano for me; and though very likely it is all our partiality,\\nsophy and i cannot help thinking frederick\\'s manners better than his.\\nthere is something about frederick more to our taste.\"\\n\\nanne was caught.  she had only meant to oppose the too common idea\\nof spirit and gentleness being incompatible with each other,\\nnot at all to represent captain benwick\\'s manners as the very best\\nthat could possibly be; and, after a little hesitation,\\nshe was beginning to say, \"i was not entering into any comparison\\nof the two friends,\" but the admiral interrupted her with--\\n\\n\"and the thing is certainly true.  it is not a mere bit of gossip.\\nwe have it from frederick himself.  his sister had a letter\\nfrom him yesterday, in which he tells us of it, and he had just had it\\nin a letter from harville, written upon the spot, from uppercross.\\ni fancy they are all at uppercross.\"\\n\\nthis was an opportunity which anne could not resist; she said, therefore,\\n\"i hope, admiral, i hope there is nothing in the style of captain\\nwentworth\\'s letter to make you and mrs croft particularly uneasy.\\nit did seem, last autumn, as if there were an attachment between him\\nand louisa musgrove; but i hope it may be understood to have worn out\\non each side equally, and without violence.  i hope his letter\\ndoes not breathe the spirit of an ill-used man.\"\\n\\n\"not at all, not at all; there is not an oath or a murmur\\nfrom beginning to end.\"\\n\\nanne looked down to hide her smile.\\n\\n\"no, no; frederick is not a man to whine and complain; he has\\ntoo much spirit for that.  if the girl likes another man better,\\nit is very fit she should have him.\"\\n\\n\"certainly.  but what i mean is, that i hope there is nothing\\nin captain wentworth\\'s manner of writing to make you suppose\\nhe thinks himself ill-used by his friend, which might appear,\\nyou know, without its being absolutely said.  i should be very sorry\\nthat such a friendship as has subsisted between him and captain benwick\\nshould be destroyed, or even wounded, by a circumstance of this sort.\"\\n\\n\"yes, yes, i understand you.  but there is nothing at all of that nature\\nin the letter.  he does not give the least fling at benwick;\\ndoes not so much as say, `i wonder at it, i have a reason of my own\\nfor wondering at it.\\'  no, you would not guess, from his way of writing,\\nthat he had ever thought of this miss (what\\'s her name?) for himself.\\nhe very handsomely hopes they will be happy together; and there is\\nnothing very unforgiving in that, i think.\"\\n\\nanne did not receive the perfect conviction which the admiral meant\\nto convey, but it would have been useless to press the enquiry farther.\\nshe therefore satisfied herself with common-place remarks or quiet\\nattention, and the admiral had it all his own way.\\n\\n\"poor frederick!\" said he at last.  \"now he must begin all over again\\nwith somebody else.  i think we must get him to bath.  sophy must write,\\nand beg him to come to bath.  here are pretty girls enough, i am sure.\\nit would be of no use to go to uppercross again, for that other\\nmiss musgrove, i find, is bespoke by her cousin, the young parson.\\ndo not you think, miss elliot, we had better try to get him to bath?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 19\\n\\n\\nwhile admiral croft was taking this walk with anne, and expressing\\nhis wish of getting captain wentworth to bath, captain wentworth\\nwas already on his way thither.  before mrs croft had written,\\nhe was arrived, and the very next time anne walked out, she saw him.\\n\\nmr elliot was attending his two cousins and mrs clay.  they were\\nin milsom street.  it began to rain, not much, but enough to\\nmake shelter desirable for women, and quite enough to make it\\nvery desirable for miss elliot to have the advantage of being\\nconveyed home in lady dalrymple\\'s carriage, which was seen waiting\\nat a little distance; she, anne, and mrs clay, therefore,\\nturned into molland\\'s, while mr elliot stepped to lady dalrymple,\\nto request her assistance.  he soon joined them again, successful,\\nof course; lady dalrymple would be most happy to take them home,\\nand would call for them in a few minutes.\\n\\nher ladyship\\'s carriage was a barouche, and did not hold\\nmore than four with any comfort.  miss carteret was with her mother;\\nconsequently it was not reasonable to expect accommodation\\nfor all the three camden place ladies.  there could be no doubt\\nas to miss elliot.  whoever suffered inconvenience, she must suffer none,\\nbut it occupied a little time to settle the point of civility\\nbetween the other two.  the rain was a mere trifle, and anne was\\nmost sincere in preferring a walk with mr elliot.  but the rain was also\\na mere trifle to mrs clay; she would hardly allow it even to drop at all,\\nand her boots were so thick! much thicker than miss anne\\'s;\\nand, in short, her civility rendered her quite as anxious to be left\\nto walk with mr elliot as anne could be, and it was discussed between them\\nwith a generosity so polite and so determined, that the others were\\nobliged to settle it for them; miss elliot maintaining that mrs clay\\nhad a little cold already, and mr elliot deciding on appeal,\\nthat his cousin anne\\'s boots were rather the thickest.\\n\\nit was fixed accordingly, that mrs clay should be of the party\\nin the carriage; and they had just reached this point, when anne,\\nas she sat near the window, descried, most decidedly and distinctly,\\ncaptain wentworth walking down the street.\\n\\nher start was perceptible only to herself; but she instantly felt that\\nshe was the greatest simpleton in the world, the most unaccountable\\nand absurd!  for a few minutes she saw nothing before her;\\nit was all confusion.  she was lost, and when she had scolded\\nback her senses, she found the others still waiting for the carriage,\\nand mr elliot (always obliging) just setting off for union street\\non a commission of mrs clay\\'s.\\n\\nshe now felt a great inclination to go to the outer door;\\nshe wanted to see if it rained.  why was she to suspect herself\\nof another motive?  captain wentworth must be out of sight.\\nshe left her seat, she would go; one half of her should not be always\\nso much wiser than the other half, or always suspecting the other\\nof being worse than it was.  she would see if it rained.\\nshe was sent back, however, in a moment by the entrance of\\ncaptain wentworth himself, among a party of gentlemen and ladies,\\nevidently his acquaintance, and whom he must have joined\\na little below milsom street.  he was more obviously struck\\nand confused by the sight of her than she had ever observed before;\\nhe looked quite red.  for the first time, since their renewed acquaintance,\\nshe felt that she was betraying the least sensibility of the two.\\nshe had the advantage of him in the preparation of the last few moments.\\nall the overpowering, blinding, bewildering, first effects\\nof strong surprise were over with her.  still, however,\\nshe had enough to feel!  it was agitation, pain, pleasure,\\na something between delight and misery.\\n\\nhe spoke to her, and then turned away.  the character of his manner\\nwas embarrassment.  she could not have called it either cold or friendly,\\nor anything so certainly as embarrassed.\\n\\nafter a short interval, however, he came towards her, and spoke again.\\nmutual enquiries on common subjects passed:  neither of them, probably,\\nmuch the wiser for what they heard, and anne continuing fully sensible\\nof his being less at ease than formerly.  they had by dint of being\\nso very much together, got to speak to each other with a considerable\\nportion of apparent indifference and calmness; but he could not do it now.\\ntime had changed him, or louisa had changed him.  there was consciousness\\nof some sort or other.  he looked very well, not as if he had been\\nsuffering in health or spirits, and he talked of uppercross,\\nof the musgroves, nay, even of louisa, and had even a momentary look\\nof his own arch significance as he named her; but yet it was\\ncaptain wentworth not comfortable, not easy, not able to feign that he was.\\n\\nit did not surprise, but it grieved anne to observe that elizabeth\\nwould not know him.  she saw that he saw elizabeth, that elizabeth saw him,\\nthat there was complete internal recognition on each side;\\nshe was convinced that he was ready to be acknowledged as an acquaintance,\\nexpecting it, and she had the pain of seeing her sister turn away\\nwith unalterable coldness.\\n\\nlady dalrymple\\'s carriage, for which miss elliot was growing\\nvery impatient, now drew up; the servant came in to announce it.\\nit was beginning to rain again, and altogether there was a delay,\\nand a bustle, and a talking, which must make all the little crowd\\nin the shop understand that lady dalrymple was calling to convey\\nmiss elliot.  at last miss elliot and her friend, unattended but\\nby the servant, (for there was no cousin returned), were walking off;\\nand captain wentworth, watching them, turned again to anne,\\nand by manner, rather than words, was offering his services to her.\\n\\n\"i am much obliged to you,\" was her answer, \"but i am not going with them.\\nthe carriage would not accommodate so many.  i walk:  i prefer walking.\"\\n\\n\"but it rains.\"\\n\\n\"oh! very little,  nothing that i regard.\"\\n\\nafter a moment\\'s pause he said:  \"though i came only yesterday,\\ni have equipped myself properly for bath already, you see,\"\\n(pointing to a new umbrella); \"i wish you would make use of it,\\nif you are determined to walk; though i think it would be more prudent\\nto let me get you a chair.\"\\n\\nshe was very much obliged to him, but declined it all, repeating\\nher conviction, that the rain would come to nothing at present,\\nand adding, \"i am only waiting for mr elliot.  he will be here in a moment,\\ni am sure.\"\\n\\nshe had hardly spoken the words when mr elliot walked in.\\ncaptain wentworth recollected him perfectly.  there was no difference\\nbetween him and the man who had stood on the steps at lyme,\\nadmiring anne as she passed, except in the air and look and manner\\nof the privileged relation and friend.  he came in with eagerness,\\nappeared to see and think only of her, apologised for his stay,\\nwas grieved to have kept her waiting, and anxious to get her away\\nwithout further loss of time and before the rain increased;\\nand in another moment they walked off together, her arm under his,\\na gentle and embarrassed glance, and a \"good morning to you!\"\\nbeing all that she had time for, as she passed away.\\n\\nas soon as they were out of sight, the ladies of captain wentworth\\'s party\\nbegan talking of them.\\n\\n\"mr elliot does not dislike his cousin, i fancy?\"\\n\\n\"oh! no, that is clear enough.  one can guess what will happen there.\\nhe is always with them; half lives in the family, i believe.\\nwhat a very good-looking man!\"\\n\\n\"yes, and miss atkinson, who dined with him once at the wallises,\\nsays he is the most agreeable man she ever was in company with.\"\\n\\n\"she is pretty, i think; anne elliot; very pretty, when one comes\\nto look at her.  it is not the fashion to say so, but i confess\\ni admire her more than her sister.\"\\n\\n\"oh! so do i.\"\\n\\n\"and so do i.  no comparison.  but the men are all wild after miss elliot.\\nanne is too delicate for them.\"\\n\\nanne would have been particularly obliged to her cousin, if he would have\\nwalked by her side all the way to camden place, without saying a word.\\nshe had never found it so difficult to listen to him, though nothing\\ncould exceed his solicitude and care, and though his subjects\\nwere principally such as were wont to be always interesting:\\npraise, warm, just, and discriminating, of lady russell,\\nand insinuations highly rational against mrs clay.  but just now\\nshe could think only of captain wentworth.  she could not understand\\nhis present feelings, whether he were really suffering much\\nfrom disappointment or not; and till that point were settled,\\nshe could not be quite herself.\\n\\nshe hoped to be wise and reasonable in time; but alas! alas!\\nshe must confess to herself that she was not wise yet.\\n\\nanother circumstance very essential for her to know, was how long\\nhe meant to be in bath; he had not mentioned it, or she could not\\nrecollect it.  he might be only passing through.  but it was more probable\\nthat he should be come to stay.  in that case, so liable as every body was\\nto meet every body in bath, lady russell would in all likelihood\\nsee him somewhere.  would she recollect him?  how would it all be?\\n\\nshe had already been obliged to tell lady russell that louisa musgrove\\nwas to marry captain benwick.  it had cost her something to encounter\\nlady russell\\'s surprise; and now, if she were by any chance\\nto be thrown into company with captain wentworth, her imperfect knowledge\\nof the matter might add another shade of prejudice against him.\\n\\nthe following morning anne was out with her friend, and for the first hour,\\nin an incessant and fearful sort of watch for him in vain; but at last,\\nin returning down pulteney street, she distinguished him\\non the right hand pavement at such a distance as to have him in view\\nthe greater part of the street.  there were many other men about him,\\nmany groups walking the same way, but there was no mistaking him.\\nshe looked instinctively at lady russell; but not from any mad idea\\nof her recognising him so soon as she did herself.  no, it was\\nnot to be supposed that lady russell would perceive him till they\\nwere nearly opposite.  she looked at her however, from time to time,\\nanxiously; and when the moment approached which must point him out,\\nthough not daring to look again (for her own countenance she knew\\nwas unfit to be seen), she was yet perfectly conscious of\\nlady russell\\'s eyes being turned exactly in the direction for him--\\nof her being, in short, intently observing him.  she could thoroughly\\ncomprehend the sort of fascination he must possess over lady russell\\'s mind,\\nthe difficulty it must be for her to withdraw her eyes, the astonishment\\nshe must be feeling that eight or nine years should have passed over him,\\nand in foreign climes and in active service too, without robbing him\\nof one personal grace!\\n\\nat last, lady russell drew back her head.  \"now, how would she\\nspeak of him?\"\\n\\n\"you will wonder,\" said she, \"what has been fixing my eye so long;\\nbut i was looking after some window-curtains, which lady alicia and\\nmrs frankland were telling me of last night.  they described\\nthe drawing-room window-curtains of one of the houses on this\\nside of the way, and this part of the street, as being the handsomest\\nand best hung of any in bath, but could not recollect the exact number,\\nand i have been trying to find out which it could be; but i confess\\ni can see no curtains hereabouts that answer their description.\"\\n\\nanne sighed and blushed and smiled, in pity and disdain,\\neither at her friend or herself.  the part which provoked her most,\\nwas that in all this waste of foresight and caution, she should have\\nlost the right moment for seeing whether he saw them.\\n\\na day or two passed without producing anything.  the theatre or the rooms,\\nwhere he was most likely to be, were not fashionable enough\\nfor the elliots, whose evening amusements were solely in the\\nelegant stupidity of private parties, in which they were getting\\nmore and more engaged; and anne, wearied of such a state of stagnation,\\nsick of knowing nothing, and fancying herself stronger because\\nher strength was not tried, was quite impatient for the concert evening.\\nit was a concert for the benefit of a person patronised by lady dalrymple.\\nof course they must attend.  it was really expected to be a good one,\\nand captain wentworth was very fond of music.  if she could only have\\na few minutes conversation with him again, she fancied she should\\nbe satisfied; and as to the power of addressing him, she felt all over\\ncourage if the opportunity occurred.  elizabeth had turned from him,\\nlady russell overlooked him; her nerves were strengthened\\nby these circumstances; she felt that she owed him attention.\\n\\nshe had once partly promised mrs smith to spend the evening with her;\\nbut in a short hurried call she excused herself and put it off,\\nwith the more decided promise of a longer visit on the morrow.\\nmrs smith gave a most good-humoured acquiescence.\\n\\n\"by all means,\" said she; \"only tell me all about it, when you do come.\\nwho is your party?\"\\n\\nanne named them all.  mrs smith made no reply; but when she was\\nleaving her said, and with an expression half serious, half arch,\\n\"well, i heartily wish your concert may answer; and do not fail me\\nto-morrow if you can come; for i begin to have a foreboding\\nthat i may not have many more visits from you.\"\\n\\nanne was startled and confused; but after standing in a moment\\'s suspense,\\nwas obliged, and not sorry to be obliged, to hurry away.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 20\\n\\n\\nsir walter, his two daughters, and mrs clay, were the earliest\\nof all their party at the rooms in the evening; and as lady dalrymple\\nmust be waited for, they took their station by one of the fires\\nin the octagon room.  but hardly were they so settled, when the door\\nopened again, and captain wentworth walked in alone.  anne was\\nthe nearest to him, and making yet a little advance, she instantly spoke.\\nhe was preparing only to bow and pass on, but her gentle \"how do you do?\"\\nbrought him out of the straight line to stand near her, and make enquiries\\nin return, in spite of the formidable father and sister in the back ground.\\ntheir being in the back ground was a support to anne; she knew nothing\\nof their looks, and felt equal to everything which she believed\\nright to be done.\\n\\nwhile they were speaking, a whispering between her father and elizabeth\\ncaught her ear.  she could not distinguish, but she must guess the subject;\\nand on captain wentworth\\'s making a distant bow, she comprehended\\nthat her father had judged so well as to give him that\\nsimple acknowledgement of acquaintance, and she was just in time\\nby a side glance to see a slight curtsey from elizabeth herself.\\nthis, though late, and reluctant, and ungracious, was yet\\nbetter than nothing, and her spirits improved.\\n\\nafter talking, however, of the weather, and bath, and the concert,\\ntheir conversation began to flag, and so little was said at last,\\nthat she was expecting him to go every moment, but he did not;\\nhe seemed in no hurry to leave her; and presently with renewed spirit,\\nwith a little smile, a little glow, he said--\\n\\n\"i have hardly seen you since our day at lyme.  i am afraid you must have\\nsuffered from the shock, and the more from its not overpowering you\\nat the time.\"\\n\\nshe assured him that she had not.\\n\\n\"it was a frightful hour,\" said he, \"a frightful day!\" and he\\npassed his hand across his eyes, as if the remembrance were still\\ntoo painful, but in a moment, half smiling again, added,\\n\"the day has produced some effects however; has had some consequences\\nwhich must be considered as the very reverse of frightful.\\nwhen you had the presence of mind to suggest that benwick would be\\nthe properest person to fetch a surgeon, you could have little idea\\nof his being eventually one of those most concerned in her recovery.\"\\n\\n\"certainly i could have none.  but it appears--i should hope it would be\\na very happy match.  there are on both sides good principles\\nand good temper.\"\\n\\n\"yes,\" said he, looking not exactly forward; \"but there, i think,\\nends the resemblance.  with all my soul i wish them happy, and rejoice\\nover every circumstance in favour of it.  they have no difficulties\\nto contend with at home, no opposition, no caprice, no delays.\\nthe musgroves are behaving like themselves, most honourably and kindly,\\nonly anxious with true parental hearts to promote their daughter\\'s comfort.\\nall this is much, very much in favour of their happiness;\\nmore than perhaps--\"\\n\\nhe stopped.  a sudden recollection seemed to occur, and to give him\\nsome taste of that emotion which was reddening anne\\'s cheeks\\nand fixing her eyes on the ground.  after clearing his throat, however,\\nhe proceeded thus--\\n\\n\"i confess that i do think there is a disparity, too great a disparity,\\nand in a point no less essential than mind.  i regard louisa musgrove\\nas a very amiable, sweet-tempered girl, and not deficient in understanding,\\nbut benwick is something more.  he is a clever man, a reading man;\\nand i confess, that i do consider his attaching himself to her\\nwith some surprise.  had it been the effect of gratitude,\\nhad he learnt to love her, because he believed her to be preferring him,\\nit would have been another thing.  but i have no reason to suppose it so.\\nit seems, on the contrary, to have been a perfectly spontaneous,\\nuntaught feeling on his side, and this surprises me.  a man like him,\\nin his situation! with a heart pierced, wounded, almost broken!\\nfanny harville was a very superior creature, and his attachment to her\\nwas indeed attachment.  a man does not recover from such\\na devotion of the heart to such a woman.  he ought not; he does not.\"\\n\\neither from the consciousness, however, that his friend had recovered,\\nor from other consciousness, he went no farther; and anne who,\\nin spite of the agitated voice in which the latter part had been uttered,\\nand in spite of all the various noises of the room, the almost ceaseless\\nslam of the door, and ceaseless buzz of persons walking through,\\nhad distinguished every word, was struck, gratified, confused,\\nand beginning to breathe very quick, and feel an hundred things\\nin a moment.  it was impossible for her to enter on such a subject;\\nand yet, after a pause, feeling the necessity of speaking,\\nand having not the smallest wish for a total change, she only deviated\\nso far as to say--\\n\\n\"you were a good while at lyme, i think?\"\\n\\n\"about a fortnight.  i could not leave it till louisa\\'s doing well\\nwas quite ascertained.  i had been too deeply concerned in the mischief\\nto be soon at peace.  it had been my doing, solely mine.\\nshe would not have been obstinate if i had not been weak.\\nthe country round lyme is very fine.  i walked and rode a great deal;\\nand the more i saw, the more i found to admire.\"\\n\\n\"i should very much like to see lyme again,\" said anne.\\n\\n\"indeed!  i should not have supposed that you could have found\\nanything in lyme to inspire such a feeling.  the horror and distress\\nyou were involved in, the stretch of mind, the wear of spirits!\\ni should have thought your last impressions of lyme must have been\\nstrong disgust.\"\\n\\n\"the last hours were certainly very painful,\" replied anne;\\n\"but when pain is over, the remembrance of it often becomes a pleasure.\\none does not love a place the less for having suffered in it,\\nunless it has been all suffering, nothing but suffering, which was\\nby no means the case at lyme.  we were only in anxiety and distress\\nduring the last two hours, and previously there had been a great deal\\nof enjoyment.  so much novelty and beauty! i have travelled so little,\\nthat every fresh place would be interesting to me; but there is real beauty\\nat lyme; and in short\" (with a faint blush at some recollections),\\n\"altogether my impressions of the place are very agreeable.\"\\n\\nas she ceased, the entrance door opened again, and the very party appeared\\nfor whom they were waiting.  \"lady dalrymple, lady dalrymple,\"\\nwas the rejoicing sound; and with all the eagerness compatible\\nwith anxious elegance, sir walter and his two ladies stepped forward\\nto meet her.  lady dalrymple and miss carteret, escorted by mr elliot\\nand colonel wallis, who had happened to arrive nearly at the same instant,\\nadvanced into the room.  the others joined them, and it was\\na group in which anne found herself also necessarily included.\\nshe was divided from captain wentworth.  their interesting,\\nalmost too interesting conversation must be broken up for a time,\\nbut slight was the penance compared with the happiness which brought it on!\\nshe had learnt, in the last ten minutes, more of his feelings\\ntowards louisa, more of all his feelings than she dared to think of;\\nand she gave herself up to the demands of the party, to the needful\\ncivilities of the moment, with exquisite, though agitated sensations.\\nshe was in good humour with all.  she had received ideas which\\ndisposed her to be courteous and kind to all, and to pity every one,\\nas being less happy than herself.\\n\\nthe delightful emotions were a little subdued, when on stepping back\\nfrom the group, to be joined again by captain wentworth, she saw\\nthat he was gone.  she was just in time to see him turn into\\nthe concert room.  he was gone; he had disappeared, she felt\\na moment\\'s regret.  but \"they should meet again.  he would look for her,\\nhe would find her out before the evening were over, and at present,\\nperhaps, it was as well to be asunder.  she was in need of\\na little interval for recollection.\"\\n\\nupon lady russell\\'s appearance soon afterwards, the whole party\\nwas collected, and all that remained was to marshal themselves,\\nand proceed into the concert room; and be of all the consequence\\nin their power, draw as many eyes, excite as many whispers,\\nand disturb as many people as they could.\\n\\nvery, very happy were both elizabeth and anne elliot as they walked in.\\nelizabeth arm in arm with miss carteret, and looking on the broad back\\nof the dowager viscountess dalrymple before her, had nothing to wish for\\nwhich did not seem within her reach; and anne--but it would be\\nan insult to the nature of anne\\'s felicity, to draw any comparison\\nbetween it and her sister\\'s; the origin of one all selfish vanity,\\nof the other all generous attachment.\\n\\nanne saw nothing, thought nothing of the brilliancy of the room.\\nher happiness was from within.  her eyes were bright and her cheeks glowed;\\nbut she knew nothing about it.  she was thinking only of\\nthe last half hour, and as they passed to their seats, her mind took\\na hasty range over it.  his choice of subjects, his expressions,\\nand still more his manner and look, had been such as she could see\\nin only one light.  his opinion of louisa musgrove\\'s inferiority,\\nan opinion which he had seemed solicitous to give, his wonder\\nat captain benwick, his feelings as to a first, strong attachment;\\nsentences begun which he could not finish, his half averted eyes\\nand more than half expressive glance, all, all declared that he had\\na heart returning to her at least; that anger, resentment, avoidance,\\nwere no more; and that they were succeeded, not merely by friendship\\nand regard, but by the tenderness of the past.  yes, some share of\\nthe tenderness of the past.  she could not contemplate the change\\nas implying less.  he must love her.\\n\\nthese were thoughts, with their attendant visions, which occupied\\nand flurried her too much to leave her any power of observation;\\nand she passed along the room without having a glimpse of him,\\nwithout even trying to discern him.  when their places were determined on,\\nand they were all properly arranged, she looked round to see\\nif he should happen to be in the same part of the room, but he was not;\\nher eye could not reach him; and the concert being just opening,\\nshe must consent for a time to be happy in a humbler way.\\n\\nthe party was divided and disposed of on two contiguous benches:\\nanne was among those on the foremost, and mr elliot had manoeuvred so well,\\nwith the assistance of his friend colonel wallis, as to have a seat by her.\\nmiss elliot, surrounded by her cousins, and the principal object\\nof colonel wallis\\'s gallantry, was quite contented.\\n\\nanne\\'s mind was in a most favourable state for the entertainment\\nof the evening; it was just occupation enough:  she had feelings for\\nthe tender, spirits for the gay, attention for the scientific,\\nand patience for the wearisome; and had never liked a concert better,\\nat least during the first act.  towards the close of it,\\nin the interval succeeding an italian song, she explained\\nthe words of the song to mr elliot.  they had a concert bill between them.\\n\\n\"this,\" said she, \"is nearly the sense, or rather the meaning of the words,\\nfor certainly the sense of an italian love-song must not be talked of,\\nbut it is as nearly the meaning as i can give; for i do not pretend\\nto understand the language.  i am a very poor italian scholar.\"\\n\\n\"yes, yes, i see you are.  i see you know nothing of the matter.\\nyou have only knowledge enough of the language to translate at sight\\nthese inverted, transposed, curtailed italian lines, into clear,\\ncomprehensible, elegant english.  you need not say anything more\\nof your ignorance.  here is complete proof.\"\\n\\n\"i will not oppose such kind politeness; but i should be sorry to be\\nexamined by a real proficient.\"\\n\\n\"i have not had the pleasure of visiting in camden place so long,\"\\nreplied he, \"without knowing something of miss anne elliot;\\nand i do regard her as one who is too modest for the world in general\\nto be aware of half her accomplishments, and too highly accomplished\\nfor modesty to be natural in any other woman.\"\\n\\n\"for shame! for shame! this is too much flattery.  i forget what we are\\nto have next,\" turning to the bill.\\n\\n\"perhaps,\" said mr elliot, speaking low, \"i have had a longer acquaintance\\nwith your character than you are aware of.\"\\n\\n\"indeed!  how so?  you can have been acquainted with it only since\\ni came to bath, excepting as you might hear me previously spoken of\\nin my own family.\"\\n\\n\"i knew you by report long before you came to bath.  i had heard you\\ndescribed by those who knew you intimately.  i have been acquainted\\nwith you by character many years.  your person, your disposition,\\naccomplishments, manner; they were all present to me.\"\\n\\nmr elliot was not disappointed in the interest he hoped to raise.\\nno one can withstand the charm of such a mystery.  to have been\\ndescribed long ago to a recent acquaintance, by nameless people,\\nis irresistible; and anne was all curiosity.  she wondered,\\nand questioned him eagerly; but in vain.  he delighted in being asked,\\nbut he would not tell.\\n\\n\"no, no, some time or other, perhaps, but not now.  he would mention\\nno names now; but such, he could assure her, had been the fact.\\nhe had many years ago received such a description of miss anne elliot\\nas had inspired him with the highest idea of her merit, and excited\\nthe warmest curiosity to know her.\"\\n\\nanne could think of no one so likely to have spoken with\\npartiality of her many years ago as the mr wentworth of monkford,\\ncaptain wentworth\\'s brother.  he might have been in mr elliot\\'s company,\\nbut she had not courage to ask the question.\\n\\n\"the name of anne elliot,\" said he, \"has long had an interesting sound to me.\\nvery long has it possessed a charm over my fancy; and, if i dared,\\ni would breathe my wishes that the name might never change.\"\\n\\nsuch, she believed, were his words; but scarcely had she\\nreceived their sound, than her attention was caught by other sounds\\nimmediately behind her, which rendered every thing else trivial.\\nher father and lady dalrymple were speaking.\\n\\n\"a well-looking man,\" said sir walter, \"a very well-looking man.\"\\n\\n\"a very fine young man indeed!\" said lady dalrymple.  \"more air\\nthan one often sees in bath.  irish, i dare say.\"\\n\\n\"no, i just know his name.  a bowing acquaintance.  wentworth;\\ncaptain wentworth of the navy.  his sister married my tenant\\nin somersetshire, the croft, who rents kellynch.\"\\n\\nbefore sir walter had reached this point, anne\\'s eyes had caught\\nthe right direction, and distinguished captain wentworth standing\\namong a cluster of men at a little distance.  as her eyes fell on him,\\nhis seemed to be withdrawn from her.  it had that appearance.\\nit seemed as if she had been one moment too late; and as long as she\\ndared observe, he did not look again:  but the performance\\nwas recommencing, and she was forced to seem to restore her attention\\nto the orchestra and look straight forward.\\n\\nwhen she could give another glance, he had moved away.  he could not have\\ncome nearer to her if he would; she was so surrounded and shut in:\\nbut she would rather have caught his eye.\\n\\nmr elliot\\'s speech, too, distressed her.  she had no longer\\nany inclination to talk to him.  she wished him not so near her.\\n\\nthe first act was over.  now she hoped for some beneficial change;\\nand, after a period of nothing-saying amongst the party, some of them\\ndid decide on going in quest of tea.  anne was one of the few who\\ndid not choose to move.  she remained in her seat, and so did lady russell;\\nbut she had the pleasure of getting rid of mr elliot; and she did not mean,\\nwhatever she might feel on lady russell\\'s account, to shrink from\\nconversation with captain wentworth, if he gave her the opportunity.\\nshe was persuaded by lady russell\\'s countenance that she had seen him.\\n\\nhe did not come however.  anne sometimes fancied she discerned him\\nat a distance, but he never came.  the anxious interval\\nwore away unproductively.  the others returned, the room filled again,\\nbenches were reclaimed and repossessed, and another hour of pleasure\\nor of penance was to be sat out, another hour of music was to give\\ndelight or the gapes, as real or affected taste for it prevailed.\\nto anne, it chiefly wore the prospect of an hour of agitation.\\nshe could not quit that room in peace without seeing captain wentworth\\nonce more, without the interchange of one friendly look.\\n\\nin re-settling themselves there were now many changes, the result of which\\nwas favourable for her.  colonel wallis declined sitting down again,\\nand mr elliot was invited by elizabeth and miss carteret, in a manner\\nnot to be refused, to sit between them; and by some other removals,\\nand a little scheming of her own,  anne was enabled to place herself\\nmuch nearer the end of the bench than she had been before,\\nmuch more within reach of a passer-by.  she could not do so,\\nwithout comparing herself with miss larolles, the inimitable miss larolles;\\nbut still she did it, and not with much happier effect;\\nthough by what seemed prosperity in the shape of an early abdication\\nin her next neighbours, she found herself at the very end of the bench\\nbefore the concert closed.\\n\\nsuch was her situation, with a vacant space at hand, when captain wentworth\\nwas again in sight.  she saw him not far off.  he saw her too;\\nyet he looked grave, and seemed irresolute, and only by very slow degrees\\ncame at last near enough to speak to her.  she felt that something\\nmust be the matter.  the change was indubitable.  the difference\\nbetween his present air and what it had been in the octagon room\\nwas strikingly great.  why was it?  she thought of her father,\\nof lady russell.  could there have been any unpleasant glances?\\nhe began by speaking of the concert gravely, more like the captain\\nwentworth of uppercross; owned himself disappointed, had expected singing;\\nand in short, must confess that he should not be sorry when it was over.\\nanne replied, and spoke in defence of the performance so well,\\nand yet in allowance for his feelings so pleasantly, that his countenance\\nimproved, and he replied again with almost a smile.  they talked\\nfor a few minutes more; the improvement held; he even looked down\\ntowards the bench, as if he saw a place on it well worth occupying;\\nwhen at that moment a touch on her shoulder obliged anne to turn round.\\nit came from mr elliot.  he begged her pardon, but she must be applied to,\\nto explain italian again.  miss carteret was very anxious to have\\na general idea of what was next to be sung.  anne could not refuse;\\nbut never had she sacrificed to politeness with a more suffering spirit.\\n\\na few minutes, though as few as possible, were inevitably consumed;\\nand when her own mistress again, when able to turn and look\\nas she had done before, she found herself accosted by captain wentworth,\\nin a reserved yet hurried sort of farewell.  \"he must wish her good night;\\nhe was going; he should get home as fast as he could.\"\\n\\n\"is not this song worth staying for?\" said anne, suddenly struck\\nby an idea which made her yet more anxious to be encouraging.\\n\\n\"no!\" he replied impressively, \"there is nothing worth my staying for;\"\\nand he was gone directly.\\n\\njealousy of mr elliot!  it was the only intelligible motive.\\ncaptain wentworth jealous of her affection!  could she have believed it\\na week ago; three hours ago!  for a moment the gratification was exquisite.\\nbut, alas! there were very different thoughts to succeed.\\nhow was such jealousy to be quieted?  how was the truth to reach him?\\nhow, in all the peculiar disadvantages of their respective situations,\\nwould he ever learn of her real sentiments?  it was misery to think\\nof mr elliot\\'s attentions.  their evil was incalculable.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 21\\n\\n\\nanne recollected with pleasure the next morning her promise\\nof going to mrs smith, meaning that it should engage her from home\\nat the time when mr elliot would be most likely to call; for to avoid\\nmr elliot was almost a first object.\\n\\nshe felt a great deal of good-will towards him.  in spite of\\nthe mischief of his attentions, she owed him gratitude and regard,\\nperhaps compassion.  she could not help thinking much of the extraordinary\\ncircumstances attending their acquaintance, of the right which\\nhe seemed to have to interest her, by everything in situation,\\nby his own sentiments, by his early prepossession.  it was altogether\\nvery extraordinary; flattering, but painful.  there was much to regret.\\nhow she might have felt had there been no captain wentworth in the case,\\nwas not worth enquiry; for there was a captain wentworth;\\nand be the conclusion of the present suspense good or bad,\\nher affection would be his for ever.  their union, she believed,\\ncould not divide her more from other men, than their final separation.\\n\\nprettier musings of high-wrought love and eternal constancy,\\ncould never have passed along the streets of bath, than anne\\nwas sporting with from camden place to westgate buildings.\\nit was almost enough to spread purification and perfume all the way.\\n\\nshe was sure of a pleasant reception; and her friend seemed this morning\\nparticularly obliged to her for coming, seemed hardly to have expected her,\\nthough it had been an appointment.\\n\\nan account of the concert was immediately claimed; and anne\\'s recollections\\nof the concert were quite happy enough to animate her features\\nand make her rejoice to talk of it.  all that she could tell\\nshe told most gladly, but the all was little for one who had been there,\\nand unsatisfactory for such an enquirer as mrs smith, who had\\nalready heard, through the short cut of a laundress and a waiter,\\nrather more of the general success and produce of the evening\\nthan anne could relate, and who now asked in vain for several particulars\\nof the company.  everybody of any consequence or notoriety in bath\\nwas well know by name to mrs smith.\\n\\n\"the little durands were there, i conclude,\" said she, \"with their mouths\\nopen to catch the music, like unfledged sparrows ready to be fed.\\nthey never miss a concert.\"\\n\\n\"yes; i did not see them myself, but i heard mr elliot say they were\\nin the room.\"\\n\\n\"the ibbotsons, were they there? and the two new beauties,\\nwith the tall irish officer, who is talked of for one of them.\"\\n\\n\"i do not know.  i do not think they were.\"\\n\\n\"old lady mary maclean?  i need not ask after her.  she never misses,\\ni know; and you must have seen her.  she must have been in your own circle;\\nfor as you went with lady dalrymple, you were in the seats of grandeur,\\nround the orchestra, of course.\"\\n\\n\"no, that was what i dreaded.  it would have been very unpleasant to me\\nin every respect.  but happily lady dalrymple always chooses\\nto be farther off; and we were exceedingly well placed, that is,\\nfor hearing; i must not say for seeing, because i appear to have seen\\nvery little.\"\\n\\n\"oh! you saw enough for your own amusement.  i can understand.\\nthere is a sort of domestic enjoyment to be known even in a crowd,\\nand this you had.  you were a large party in yourselves,\\nand you wanted nothing beyond.\"\\n\\n\"but i ought to have looked about me more,\" said anne, conscious\\nwhile she spoke that there had in fact been no want of looking about,\\nthat the object only had been deficient.\\n\\n\"no, no; you were better employed.  you need not tell me that you\\nhad a pleasant evening.  i see it in your eye.  i perfectly see\\nhow the hours passed:  that you had always something agreeable\\nto listen to.  in the intervals of the concert it was conversation.\"\\n\\nanne half smiled and said, \"do you see that in my eye?\"\\n\\n\"yes, i do.  your countenance perfectly informs me that you were\\nin company last night with the person whom you think the most agreeable\\nin the world, the person who interests you at this present time\\nmore than all the rest of the world put together.\"\\n\\na blush overspread anne\\'s cheeks.  she could say nothing.\\n\\n\"and such being the case,\" continued mrs smith, after a short pause,\\n\"i hope you believe that i do know how to value your kindness\\nin coming to me this morning.  it is really very good of you\\nto come and sit with me, when you must have so many pleasanter demands\\nupon your time.\"\\n\\nanne heard nothing of this.  she was still in the astonishment and\\nconfusion excited by her friend\\'s penetration, unable to imagine\\nhow any report of captain wentworth could have reached her.\\nafter another short silence--\\n\\n\"pray,\" said mrs smith, \"is mr elliot aware of your acquaintance with me?\\ndoes he know that i am in bath?\"\\n\\n\"mr elliot!\" repeated anne, looking up surprised.  a moment\\'s reflection\\nshewed her the mistake she had been under.  she caught it instantaneously;\\nand recovering her courage with the feeling of safety, soon added,\\nmore composedly, \"are you acquainted with mr elliot?\"\\n\\n\"i have been a good deal acquainted with him,\" replied mrs smith, gravely,\\n\"but it seems worn out now.  it is a great while since we met.\"\\n\\n\"i was not at all aware of this.  you never mentioned it before.\\nhad i known it, i would have had the pleasure of talking to him about you.\"\\n\\n\"to confess the truth,\" said mrs smith, assuming her usual\\nair of cheerfulness, \"that is exactly the pleasure i want you to have.\\ni want you to talk about me to mr elliot.  i want your interest with him.\\nhe can be of essential service to me; and if you would have the goodness,\\nmy dear miss elliot, to make it an object to yourself,\\nof course it is done.\"\\n\\n\"i should be extremely happy; i hope you cannot doubt my willingness\\nto be of even the slightest use to you,\" replied anne; \"but i suspect\\nthat you are considering me as having a higher claim on mr elliot,\\na greater right to influence him, than is really the case.\\ni am sure you have, somehow or other, imbibed such a notion.\\nyou must consider me only as mr elliot\\'s relation.  if in that light\\nthere is anything which you suppose his cousin might fairly ask of him,\\ni beg you would not hesitate to employ me.\"\\n\\nmrs smith gave her a penetrating glance, and then, smiling, said--\\n\\n\"i have been a little premature, i perceive; i beg your pardon.\\ni ought to have waited for official information,  but now, my dear\\nmiss elliot, as an old friend, do give me a hint as to when i may speak.\\nnext week?  to be sure by next week i may be allowed to\\nthink it all settled, and build my own selfish schemes on\\nmr elliot\\'s good fortune.\"\\n\\n\"no,\" replied anne, \"nor next week, nor next, nor next.\\ni assure you that nothing of the sort you are thinking of\\nwill be settled any week.  i am not going to marry mr elliot.\\ni should like to know why you imagine i am?\"\\n\\nmrs smith looked at her again, looked earnestly, smiled,\\nshook her head, and exclaimed--\\n\\n\"now, how i do wish i understood you!  how i do wish i knew\\nwhat you were at!  i have a great idea that you do not design to be cruel,\\nwhen the right moment occurs.  till it does come, you know,\\nwe women never mean to have anybody.  it is a thing of course among us,\\nthat every man is refused, till he offers.  but why should you be cruel?\\nlet me plead for my--present friend i cannot call him, but for\\nmy former friend.  where can you look for a more suitable match?\\nwhere could you expect a more gentlemanlike, agreeable man?\\nlet me recommend mr elliot.  i am sure you hear nothing but good of him\\nfrom colonel wallis; and who can know him better than colonel wallis?\"\\n\\n\"my dear mrs smith, mr elliot\\'s wife has not been dead much above\\nhalf a year.  he ought not to be supposed to be paying his addresses\\nto any one.\"\\n\\n\"oh! if these are your only objections,\" cried mrs smith, archly,\\n\"mr elliot is safe, and i shall give myself no more trouble about him.\\ndo not forget me when you are married, that\\'s all.  let him know me to be\\na friend of yours, and then he will think little of the trouble required,\\nwhich it is very natural for him now, with so many affairs and engagements\\nof his own, to avoid and get rid of as he can; very natural, perhaps.\\nninety-nine out of a hundred would do the same.  of course,\\nhe cannot be aware of the importance to me.  well, my dear miss elliot,\\ni hope and trust you will be very happy.  mr elliot has sense\\nto understand the value of such a woman.  your peace will not be\\nshipwrecked as mine has been.  you are safe in all worldly matters,\\nand safe in his character.  he will not be led astray; he will not be\\nmisled by others to his ruin.\"\\n\\n\"no,\" said anne, \"i can readily believe all that of my cousin.\\nhe seems to have a calm decided temper, not at all open\\nto dangerous impressions.  i consider him with great respect.\\ni have no reason, from any thing that has fallen within my observation,\\nto do otherwise.  but i have not known him long; and he is not a man,\\ni think, to be known intimately soon.  will not this manner\\nof speaking of him, mrs smith, convince you that he is nothing to me?\\nsurely this must be calm enough.  and, upon my word, he is nothing to me.\\nshould he ever propose to me (which i have very little reason to imagine\\nhe has any thought of doing), i shall not accept him.  i assure you\\ni shall not.  i assure you, mr elliot had not the share which\\nyou have been supposing, in whatever pleasure the concert\\nof last night might afford:  not mr elliot; it is not mr elliot that--\"\\n\\nshe stopped, regretting with a deep blush that she had implied so much;\\nbut less would hardly have been sufficient.  mrs smith would hardly\\nhave believed so soon in mr elliot\\'s failure, but from the perception\\nof there being a somebody else.  as it was, she instantly submitted,\\nand with all the semblance of seeing nothing beyond; and anne,\\neager to escape farther notice, was impatient to know why mrs smith\\nshould have fancied she was to marry mr elliot; where she could have\\nreceived the idea, or from whom she could have heard it.\\n\\n\"do tell me how it first came into your head.\"\\n\\n\"it first came into my head,\" replied mrs smith, \"upon finding how much\\nyou were together, and feeling it to be the most probable thing\\nin the world to be wished for by everybody belonging to either of you;\\nand you may depend upon it that all your acquaintance have disposed of you\\nin the same way.  but i never heard it spoken of till two days ago.\"\\n\\n\"and has it indeed been spoken of?\"\\n\\n\"did you observe the woman who opened the door to you when\\nyou called yesterday?\"\\n\\n\"no.  was not it mrs speed, as usual, or the maid?  i observed\\nno one in particular.\"\\n\\n\"it was my friend mrs rooke; nurse rooke; who, by-the-bye,\\nhad a great curiosity to see you, and was delighted to be in the way\\nto let you in.  she came away from marlborough buildings only on sunday;\\nand she it was who told me you were to marry mr elliot.\\nshe had had it from mrs wallis herself, which did not seem bad authority.\\nshe sat an hour with me on monday evening, and gave me the whole history.\"\\n\"the whole history,\" repeated anne, laughing.  \"she could not make\\na very long history, i think, of one such little article\\nof unfounded news.\"\\n\\nmrs smith said nothing.\\n\\n\"but,\" continued anne, presently, \"though there is no truth in my having\\nthis claim on mr elliot, i should be extremely happy to be of use to you\\nin any way that i could.  shall i mention to him your being in bath?\\nshall i take any message?\"\\n\\n\"no, i thank you:  no, certainly not.  in the warmth of the moment,\\nand under a mistaken impression, i might, perhaps, have endeavoured\\nto interest you in some circumstances; but not now.  no, i thank you,\\ni have nothing to trouble you with.\"\\n\\n\"i think you spoke of having known mr elliot many years?\"\\n\\n\"i did.\"\\n\\n\"not before he was married, i suppose?\"\\n\\n\"yes; he was not married when i knew him first.\"\\n\\n\"and--were you much acquainted?\"\\n\\n\"intimately.\"\\n\\n\"indeed!  then do tell me what he was at that time of life.\\ni have a great curiosity to know what mr elliot was as a very young man.\\nwas he at all such as he appears now?\"\\n\\n\"i have not seen mr elliot these three years,\" was mrs smith\\'s answer,\\ngiven so gravely that it was impossible to pursue the subject farther;\\nand anne felt that she had gained nothing but an increase of curiosity.\\nthey were both silent:  mrs smith very thoughtful.  at last--\\n\\n\"i beg your pardon, my dear miss elliot,\" she cried, in her\\nnatural tone of cordiality, \"i beg your pardon for the short answers\\ni have been giving you, but i have been uncertain what i ought to do.\\ni have been doubting and considering as to what i ought to tell you.\\nthere were many things to be taken into the account.  one hates\\nto be officious, to be giving bad impressions, making mischief.\\neven the smooth surface of family-union seems worth preserving,\\nthough there may be nothing durable beneath.  however, i have determined;\\ni think i am right; i think you ought to be made acquainted\\nwith mr elliot\\'s real character.  though i fully believe that,\\nat present, you have not the smallest intention of accepting him,\\nthere is no saying what may happen.  you might, some time or other,\\nbe differently affected towards him.  hear the truth, therefore,\\nnow, while you are unprejudiced.  mr elliot is a man without heart\\nor conscience; a designing, wary, cold-blooded being, who thinks\\nonly of himself; whom for his own interest or ease, would be guilty\\nof any cruelty, or any treachery, that could be perpetrated without\\nrisk of his general character.  he has no feeling for others.\\nthose whom he has been the chief cause of leading into ruin,\\nhe can neglect and desert without the smallest compunction.\\nhe is totally beyond the reach of any sentiment of justice or compassion.\\noh! he is black at heart, hollow and black!\"\\n\\nanne\\'s astonished air, and exclamation of wonder, made her pause,\\nand in a calmer manner, she added,\\n\\n\"my expressions startle you.  you must allow for an injured, angry woman.\\nbut i will try to command myself.  i will not abuse him.\\ni will only tell you what i have found him.  facts shall speak.\\nhe was the intimate friend of my dear husband, who trusted and loved him,\\nand thought him as good as himself.  the intimacy had been formed\\nbefore our marriage.  i found them most intimate friends; and i, too,\\nbecame excessively pleased with mr elliot, and entertained\\nthe highest opinion of him.  at nineteen, you know, one does not\\nthink very seriously; but mr elliot appeared to me quite as good as others,\\nand much more agreeable than most others, and we were almost\\nalways together.  we were principally in town, living in very good style.\\nhe was then the inferior in circumstances; he was then the poor one;\\nhe had chambers in the temple, and it was as much as he could do\\nto support the appearance of a gentleman.  he had always a home\\nwith us whenever he chose it; he was always welcome; he was like a brother.\\nmy poor charles, who had the finest, most generous spirit in the world,\\nwould have divided his last farthing with him; and i know that his purse\\nwas open to him; i know that he often assisted him.\"\\n\\n\"this must have been about that very period of mr elliot\\'s life,\"\\nsaid anne, \"which has always excited my particular curiosity.\\nit must have been about the same time that he became known to\\nmy father and sister.  i never knew him myself; i only heard of him;\\nbut there was a something in his conduct then, with regard to\\nmy father and sister, and afterwards in the circumstances of his marriage,\\nwhich i never could quite reconcile with present times.  it seemed\\nto announce a different sort of man.\"\\n\\n\"i know it all, i know it all,\" cried mrs smith.  \"he had been\\nintroduced to sir walter and your sister before i was acquainted with him,\\nbut i heard him speak of them for ever.  i know he was invited\\nand encouraged, and i know he did not choose to go.  i can satisfy you,\\nperhaps, on points which you would little expect; and as to his marriage,\\ni knew all about it at the time.  i was privy to all the fors and againsts;\\ni was the friend to whom he confided his hopes and plans; and though\\ni did not know his wife previously, her inferior situation in society,\\nindeed, rendered that impossible, yet i knew her all her life afterwards,\\nor at least till within the last two years of her life, and can answer\\nany question you may wish to put.\"\\n\\n\"nay,\" said anne, \"i have no particular enquiry to make about her.\\ni have always understood they were not a happy couple.  but i should\\nlike to know why, at that time of his life, he should slight\\nmy father\\'s acquaintance as he did.  my father was certainly disposed\\nto take very kind and proper notice of him.  why did mr elliot draw back?\"\\n\\n\"mr elliot,\" replied mrs smith, \"at that period of his life,\\nhad one object in view:  to make his fortune, and by a rather quicker\\nprocess than the law.  he was determined to make it by marriage.\\nhe was determined, at least, not to mar it by an imprudent marriage;\\nand i know it was his belief (whether justly or not, of course\\ni cannot decide), that your father and sister, in their civilities\\nand invitations, were designing a match between the heir\\nand the young lady, and it was impossible that such a match\\nshould have answered his ideas of wealth and independence.\\nthat was his motive for drawing back, i can assure you.\\nhe told me the whole story.  he had no concealments with me.\\nit was curious, that having just left you behind me in bath,\\nmy first and principal acquaintance on marrying should be your cousin;\\nand that, through him, i should be continually hearing of your father\\nand sister.  he described one miss elliot, and i thought\\nvery affectionately of the other.\"\\n\\n\"perhaps,\" cried anne, struck by a sudden idea, \"you sometimes\\nspoke of me to mr elliot?\"\\n\\n\"to be sure i did; very often.  i used to boast of my own anne elliot,\\nand vouch for your being a very different creature from--\"\\n\\nshe checked herself just in time.\\n\\n\"this accounts for something which mr elliot said last night,\"\\ncried anne.  \"this explains it.  i found he had been used to hear of me.\\ni could not comprehend how.  what wild imaginations one forms where\\ndear self is concerned!  how sure to be mistaken!  but i beg your pardon;\\ni have interrupted you.  mr elliot married then completely for money?\\nthe circumstances, probably, which first opened your eyes\\nto his character.\"\\n\\nmrs smith hesitated a little here.  \"oh! those things are too common.\\nwhen one lives in the world, a man or woman\\'s marrying for money\\nis too common to strike one as it ought.  i was very young,\\nand associated only with the young, and we were a thoughtless,\\ngay set, without any strict rules of conduct.  we lived for enjoyment.\\ni think differently now; time and sickness and sorrow have given me\\nother notions; but at that period i must own i saw nothing reprehensible\\nin what mr elliot was doing.  `to do the best for himself,\\'\\npassed as a duty.\"\\n\\n\"but was not she a very low woman?\"\\n\\n\"yes; which i objected to, but he would not regard.  money, money,\\nwas all that he wanted.  her father was a grazier, her grandfather\\nhad been a butcher, but that was all nothing.  she was a fine woman,\\nhad had a decent education, was brought forward by some cousins,\\nthrown by chance into mr elliot\\'s company, and fell in love with him;\\nand not a difficulty or a scruple was there on his side,\\nwith respect to her birth.  all his caution was spent in being secured\\nof the real amount of her fortune, before he committed himself.\\ndepend upon it, whatever esteem mr elliot may have for his own situation\\nin life now, as a young man he had not the smallest value for it.\\nhis chance for the kellynch estate was something, but all the honour\\nof the family he held as cheap as dirt.  i have often heard him declare,\\nthat if baronetcies were saleable, anybody should have his\\nfor fifty pounds, arms and motto, name and livery included;\\nbut i will not pretend to repeat half that i used to hear him say\\non that subject.  it would not be fair; and yet you ought to have proof,\\nfor what is all this but assertion, and you shall have proof.\"\\n\\n\"indeed, my dear mrs smith, i want none,\" cried anne.  \"you have asserted\\nnothing contradictory to what mr elliot appeared to be some years ago.\\nthis is all in confirmation, rather, of what we used to hear and believe.\\ni am more curious to know why he should be so different now.\"\\n\\n\"but for my satisfaction, if you will have the goodness to ring for mary;\\nstay:  i am sure you will have the still greater goodness of\\ngoing yourself into my bedroom, and bringing me the small inlaid box\\nwhich you will find on the upper shelf of the closet.\"\\n\\nanne, seeing her friend to be earnestly bent on it, did as she was desired.\\nthe box was brought and placed before her, and mrs smith, sighing over it\\nas she unlocked it, said--\\n\\n\"this is full of papers belonging to him, to my husband;\\na small portion only of what i had to look over when i lost him.\\nthe letter i am looking for was one written by mr elliot to him\\nbefore our marriage, and happened to be saved; why, one can hardly imagine.\\nbut he was careless and immethodical, like other men, about those things;\\nand when i came to examine his papers, i found it with others\\nstill more trivial, from different people scattered here and there,\\nwhile many letters and memorandums of real importance had been destroyed.\\nhere it is; i would not burn it, because being even then very little\\nsatisfied with mr elliot, i was determined to preserve every document\\nof former intimacy.  i have now another motive for being glad\\nthat i can produce it.\"\\n\\nthis was the letter, directed to \"charles smith, esq. tunbridge wells,\"\\nand dated from london, as far back as july, 1803: --\\n\\n\"dear smith,--i have received yours.  your kindness almost overpowers me.\\ni wish nature had made such hearts as yours more common, but i have\\nlived three-and-twenty years in the world, and have seen none like it.\\nat present, believe me, i have no need of your services,\\nbeing in cash again.  give me joy:  i have got rid of sir walter and miss.\\nthey are gone back to kellynch, and almost made me swear to visit them\\nthis summer; but my first visit to kellynch will be with a surveyor,\\nto tell me how to bring it with best advantage to the hammer.\\nthe baronet, nevertheless, is not unlikely to marry again;\\nhe is quite fool enough.  if he does, however, they will leave me in peace,\\nwhich may be a decent equivalent  for the reversion.  he is worse\\nthan last year.\\n\\n\"i wish i had any name but elliot.  i am sick of it.  the name of walter\\ni can drop, thank god! and i desire you will never insult me\\nwith my second w. again, meaning, for the rest of my life,\\nto be only yours truly,--wm. elliot.\"\\n\\nsuch a letter could not be read without putting anne in a glow;\\nand mrs smith, observing the high colour in her face, said--\\n\\n\"the language, i know, is highly disrespectful.  though i have forgot\\nthe exact terms, i have a perfect impression of the general meaning.\\nbut it shows you the man.  mark his professions to my poor husband.\\ncan any thing be stronger?\"\\n\\nanne could not immediately get over the shock and mortification\\nof finding such words applied to her father.  she was obliged to recollect\\nthat her seeing the letter was a violation of the laws of honour,\\nthat no one ought to be judged or to be known by such testimonies,\\nthat no private correspondence could bear the eye of others,\\nbefore she could recover calmness enough to return the letter\\nwhich she had been meditating over, and say--\\n\\n\"thank you.  this is full proof undoubtedly; proof of every thing\\nyou were saying.  but why be acquainted with us now?\"\\n\\n\"i can explain this too,\" cried mrs smith, smiling.\\n\\n\"can you really?\"\\n\\n\"yes.  i have shewn you mr elliot as he was a dozen years ago,\\nand i will shew him as he is now.  i cannot produce written proof again,\\nbut i can give as authentic oral testimony as you can desire, of what\\nhe is now wanting, and what he is now doing.  he is no hypocrite now.\\nhe truly wants to marry you.  his present attentions to your family\\nare very sincere:  quite from the heart.  i will give you my authority:\\nhis friend colonel wallis.\"\\n\\n\"colonel wallis! you are acquainted with him?\"\\n\\n\"no.  it does not come to me in quite so direct a line as that;\\nit takes a bend or two, but nothing of consequence.  the stream\\nis as good as at first; the little rubbish it collects in the turnings\\nis easily moved away.  mr elliot talks unreservedly to colonel wallis\\nof his views on you, which said colonel wallis, i imagine to be,\\nin himself, a sensible, careful, discerning sort of character;\\nbut colonel wallis has a very pretty silly wife, to whom\\nhe tells things which he had better not, and he repeats it all to her.\\nshe in the overflowing spirits of her recovery, repeats it all\\nto her nurse; and the nurse  knowing my acquaintance with you,\\nvery naturally brings it all to me.  on monday evening, my good friend\\nmrs rooke let me thus much into the secrets of marlborough buildings.\\nwhen i talked of a whole history, therefore, you see i was\\nnot romancing so much as you supposed.\"\\n\\n\"my dear mrs smith, your authority is deficient.  this will not do.\\nmr elliot\\'s having any views on me will not in the least account\\nfor the efforts he made towards a reconciliation with my father.\\nthat was all prior to my coming to bath.  i found them on\\nthe most friendly terms when i arrived.\"\\n\\n\"i know you did; i know it all perfectly, but--\"\\n\\n\"indeed, mrs smith, we must not expect to get real information\\nin such a line.  facts or opinions which are to pass through the hands\\nof so many, to be misconceived by folly in one, and ignorance in another,\\ncan hardly have much truth left.\"\\n\\n\"only give me a hearing.  you will soon be able to judge of\\nthe general credit due, by listening to some particulars\\nwhich you can yourself immediately contradict or confirm.\\nnobody supposes that you were his first inducement.  he had seen you\\nindeed, before he came to bath, and admired you, but without\\nknowing it to be you.  so says my historian, at least.  is this true?\\ndid he see you last summer or autumn, `somewhere down in the west,\\'\\nto use her own words, without knowing it to be you?\"\\n\\n\"he certainly did.  so far it is very true.  at lyme.\\ni happened to be at lyme.\"\\n\\n\"well,\" continued mrs smith, triumphantly, \"grant my friend the credit\\ndue to the establishment of the first point asserted.  he saw you then\\nat lyme, and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleased\\nto meet with you again in camden place, as miss anne elliot,\\nand from that moment, i have no doubt, had a double motive\\nin his visits there.  but there was another, and an earlier,\\nwhich i will now explain.  if there is anything in my story which you know\\nto be either false or improbable, stop me.  my account states,\\nthat your sister\\'s friend, the lady now staying with you,\\nwhom i have heard you mention, came to bath with miss elliot and sir walter\\nas long ago as september (in short when they first came themselves),\\nand has been staying there ever since; that she is a clever, insinuating,\\nhandsome woman, poor and plausible, and altogether such in situation\\nand manner, as to give a general idea, among sir walter\\'s acquaintance,\\nof her meaning to be lady elliot, and as general a surprise\\nthat miss elliot should be apparently, blind to the danger.\"\\n\\nhere mrs smith paused a moment; but anne had not a word to say,\\nand she continued--\\n\\n\"this was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family,\\nlong before you returned to it; and colonel wallis had his eye\\nupon your father enough to be sensible of it, though he did not then\\nvisit in camden place; but his regard for mr elliot gave him an interest\\nin watching all that was going on there, and when mr elliot came to bath\\nfor a day or two, as he happened to do a little before christmas,\\ncolonel wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of things,\\nand the reports beginning to prevail.  now you are to understand,\\nthat time had worked a very material change in mr elliot\\'s opinions\\nas to the value of a baronetcy.  upon all points of blood and connexion\\nhe is a completely altered man.  having long had as much money\\nas he could spend, nothing to wish for on the side of avarice\\nor indulgence, he has been gradually learning to pin his happiness\\nupon the consequence he is heir to.  i thought it coming on\\nbefore our acquaintance ceased, but it is now a confirmed feeling.\\nhe cannot bear the idea of not being sir william.  you may guess,\\ntherefore, that the news he heard from his friend could not be\\nvery agreeable, and you may guess what it produced; the resolution\\nof coming back to bath as soon as possible, and of fixing himself here\\nfor a time, with the view of renewing his former acquaintance,\\nand recovering such a footing in the family as might give him the means\\nof ascertaining the degree of his danger, and of circumventing the lady\\nif he found it material.  this was agreed upon between the two friends\\nas the only thing to be done; and colonel wallis was to assist\\nin every way that he could.  he was to be introduced, and mrs wallis\\nwas to be introduced, and everybody was to be introduced.\\nmr elliot came back accordingly; and on application was forgiven,\\nas you know, and re-admitted into the family; and there it was\\nhis constant object, and his only object (till your arrival\\nadded another motive), to watch sir walter and mrs clay.\\nhe omitted no opportunity of being with them, threw himself in their way,\\ncalled at all hours; but i need not be particular on this subject.\\nyou can imagine what an artful man would do; and with this guide,\\nperhaps, may recollect what you have seen him do.\"\\n\\n\"yes,\" said anne, \"you tell me nothing which does not accord with\\nwhat i have known, or could imagine.  there is always something offensive\\nin the details of cunning.  the manoeuvres of selfishness and duplicity\\nmust ever be revolting, but i have heard nothing which really surprises me.\\ni know those who would be shocked by such a representation of mr elliot,\\nwho would have difficulty in believing it; but i have never been satisfied.\\ni have always wanted some other motive for his conduct than appeared.\\ni should like to know his present opinion, as to the probability\\nof the event he has been in dread of; whether he considers the danger\\nto be lessening or not.\"\\n\\n\"lessening, i understand,\" replied mrs smith.  \"he thinks mrs clay\\nafraid of him, aware that he sees through her, and not daring to proceed\\nas she might do in his absence.  but since he must be absent\\nsome time or other, i do not perceive how he can ever be secure\\nwhile she holds her present influence.  mrs wallis has an amusing idea,\\nas nurse tells me, that it is to be put into the marriage articles\\nwhen you and mr elliot marry, that your father is not to marry mrs clay.\\na scheme, worthy of mrs wallis\\'s understanding, by all accounts;\\nbut my sensible nurse rooke sees the absurdity of it.  `why, to be sure,\\nma\\'am,\\' said she, `it would not prevent his marrying anybody else.\\'\\nand, indeed, to own the truth, i do not think nurse, in her heart,\\nis a very strenuous opposer of sir walter\\'s making a second match.\\nshe must be allowed to be a favourer of matrimony, you know;\\nand (since self will intrude) who can say that she may not have\\nsome flying visions of attending the next lady elliot, through\\nmrs wallis\\'s recommendation?\"\\n\\n\"i am very glad to know all this,\" said anne, after a little\\nthoughtfulness.  \"it will be more painful to me in some respects\\nto be in company with him, but i shall know better what to do.\\nmy line of conduct will be more direct.  mr elliot is evidently\\na disingenuous, artificial, worldly man, who has never had\\nany better principle to guide him than selfishness.\"\\n\\nbut mr elliot was not done with.  mrs smith had been carried away\\nfrom her first direction, and anne had forgotten, in the interest\\nof her own family concerns, how much had been originally implied\\nagainst him; but her attention was now called to the explanation\\nof those first hints, and she listened to a recital which,\\nif it did not perfectly justify the unqualified bitterness of mrs smith,\\nproved him to have been very unfeeling in his conduct towards her;\\nvery deficient both in justice and compassion.\\n\\nshe learned that (the intimacy between them continuing unimpaired\\nby mr elliot\\'s marriage) they had been as before always together,\\nand mr elliot had led his friend into expenses much beyond his fortune.\\nmrs smith did not want to take blame to herself, and was most tender\\nof throwing any on her husband; but anne could collect that their income\\nhad never been equal to their style of living, and that from the first\\nthere had been a great deal of general and joint extravagance.\\nfrom his wife\\'s account of him she could discern mr smith to have been\\na man of warm feelings, easy temper, careless habits, and not strong\\nunderstanding, much more amiable than his friend, and very unlike him,\\nled by him, and probably despised by him.  mr elliot, raised by\\nhis marriage to great affluence, and disposed to every gratification\\nof pleasure and vanity which could be commanded without involving himself,\\n(for with all his self-indulgence he had become a prudent man),\\nand beginning to be rich, just as his friend ought to have found himself\\nto be poor, seemed to have had no concern at all for that friend\\'s\\nprobable finances, but, on the contrary, had been prompting and\\nencouraging expenses which could end only in ruin; and the smiths\\naccordingly had been ruined.\\n\\nthe husband had died just in time to be spared the full knowledge of it.\\nthey had previously known embarrassments enough to try the friendship\\nof their friends, and to prove that mr elliot\\'s had better not be tried;\\nbut it was not till his death that the wretched state of his affairs\\nwas fully known.  with a confidence in mr elliot\\'s regard,\\nmore creditable to his feelings than his judgement, mr smith had\\nappointed him the executor of his will; but mr elliot would not act,\\nand the difficulties and distress which this refusal had heaped on her,\\nin addition to the inevitable sufferings of her situation, had been such\\nas could not be related without anguish of spirit, or listened to\\nwithout corresponding indignation.\\n\\nanne was shewn some letters of his on the occasion, answers to\\nurgent applications from mrs smith, which all breathed the same\\nstern resolution of not engaging in a fruitless trouble, and,\\nunder a cold civility, the same hard-hearted indifference\\nto any of the evils it might bring on her.  it was a dreadful picture\\nof ingratitude and inhumanity; and anne felt, at some moments,\\nthat no flagrant open crime could have been worse.  she had a great deal\\nto listen to; all the particulars of past sad scenes, all the minutiae\\nof distress upon distress, which in former conversations had been\\nmerely hinted at, were dwelt on now with a natural indulgence.\\nanne could perfectly comprehend the exquisite relief, and was only\\nthe more inclined to wonder at the composure of her friend\\'s\\nusual state of mind.\\n\\nthere was one circumstance in the history of her grievances\\nof particular irritation.  she had good reason to believe that\\nsome property of her husband in the west indies, which had been\\nfor many years under a sort of sequestration for the payment\\nof its own incumbrances, might be recoverable by proper measures;\\nand this property, though not large, would be enough to make\\nher comparatively rich.  but there was nobody to stir in it.\\nmr elliot would do nothing, and she could do nothing herself,\\nequally disabled from personal exertion by her state of\\nbodily weakness, and from employing others by her want of money.\\nshe had no natural connexions to assist her even with their counsel,\\nand she could not afford to purchase the assistance of the law.\\nthis was a cruel aggravation of actually straitened means.\\nto feel that she ought to be in better circumstances,\\nthat a little trouble in the right place might do it,\\nand to fear that delay might be even weakening her claims,\\nwas hard to bear.\\n\\nit was on this point that she had hoped to engage anne\\'s good offices\\nwith mr elliot.  she had previously, in the anticipation\\nof their marriage, been very apprehensive of losing her friend by it;\\nbut on being assured that he could have made no attempt of that nature,\\nsince he did not even know her to be in bath, it immediately occurred,\\nthat something might be done in her favour by the influence of the woman\\nhe loved, and she had been hastily preparing to interest anne\\'s feelings,\\nas far as the observances due to mr elliot\\'s character would allow,\\nwhen anne\\'s refutation of the supposed engagement changed\\nthe face of everything; and while it took from her the new-formed hope\\nof succeeding in the object of her first anxiety, left her at least\\nthe comfort of telling the whole story her own way.\\n\\nafter listening to this full description of mr elliot, anne could not but\\nexpress some surprise at mrs smith\\'s having spoken of him so favourably\\nin the beginning of their conversation.  \"she had seemed to recommend\\nand praise him!\"\\n\\n\"my dear,\" was mrs smith\\'s reply, \"there was nothing else to be done.\\ni considered your marrying him as certain, though he might not yet\\nhave made the offer, and i could no more speak the truth of him,\\nthan if he had been your husband.  my heart bled for you,\\nas i talked of happiness; and yet he is sensible, he is agreeable,\\nand with such a woman as you, it was not absolutely hopeless.\\nhe was very unkind to his first wife.  they were wretched together.\\nbut she was too ignorant and giddy for respect, and he had never loved her.\\ni was willing to hope that you must fare better.\"\\n\\nanne could just acknowledge within herself such a possibility\\nof having been induced to marry him, as made her shudder at the idea\\nof the misery which must have followed.  it was just possible that\\nshe might have been persuaded by lady russell!  and under such\\na supposition, which would have been most miserable, when time had\\ndisclosed all, too late?\\n\\nit was very desirable that lady russell should be no longer deceived;\\nand one of the concluding arrangements of this important conference,\\nwhich carried them through the greater part of the morning,\\nwas, that anne had full liberty to communicate to her friend\\neverything relative to mrs smith, in which his conduct was involved.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 22\\n\\n\\nanne went home to think over all that she had heard.  in one point,\\nher feelings were relieved by this knowledge of mr elliot.\\nthere was no longer anything of tenderness due to him.  he stood as\\nopposed to captain wentworth, in all his own unwelcome obtrusiveness;\\nand the evil of his attentions last night, the irremediable mischief\\nhe might have done, was considered with sensations unqualified, unperplexed.\\npity for him was all over.  but this was the only point of relief.\\nin every other respect, in looking around her, or penetrating forward,\\nshe saw more to distrust and to apprehend.  she was concerned\\nfor the disappointment and pain lady russell would be feeling;\\nfor the mortifications which must be hanging over her father and sister,\\nand had all the distress of foreseeing many evils, without knowing\\nhow to avert any one of them.  she was most thankful for her own\\nknowledge of him.  she had never considered herself as entitled to reward\\nfor not slighting an old friend like mrs smith, but here was\\na reward indeed springing from it!  mrs smith had been able to tell her\\nwhat no one else could have done.  could the knowledge have\\nbeen extended through her family?  but this was a vain idea.\\nshe must talk to lady russell, tell her, consult with her,\\nand having done her best, wait the event with as much composure\\nas possible; and after all, her greatest want of composure would be\\nin that quarter of the mind which could not be opened to lady russell;\\nin that flow of anxieties and fears which must be all to herself.\\n\\n\\nshe found, on reaching home, that she had, as she intended,\\nescaped seeing mr elliot; that he had called and paid them\\na long morning visit; but hardly had she congratulated herself,\\nand felt safe, when she heard that he was coming again in the evening.\\n\\n\"i had not the smallest intention of asking him,\" said elizabeth,\\nwith affected carelessness, \"but he gave so many hints;\\nso mrs clay says, at least.\"\\n\\n\"indeed, i do say it.  i never saw anybody in my life spell harder\\nfor an invitation.  poor man!  i was really in pain for him;\\nfor your hard-hearted sister, miss anne, seems bent on cruelty.\"\\n\\n\"oh!\" cried elizabeth, \"i have been rather too much used to the game\\nto be soon overcome by a gentleman\\'s hints.  however, when i found\\nhow excessively he was regretting that he should miss my father\\nthis morning, i gave way immediately, for i would never really omit\\nan opportunity of bring him and sir walter together.  they appear to\\nso much advantage in company with each other.  each behaving so pleasantly.\\nmr elliot looking up with so much respect.\"\\n\\n\"quite delightful!\" cried mrs clay, not daring, however,\\nto turn her eyes towards anne.  \"exactly like father and son!\\ndear miss elliot, may i not say father and son?\"\\n\\n\"oh! i lay no embargo on any body\\'s words.  if you will have such\\nideas!  but, upon my word, i am scarcely sensible of his attentions\\nbeing beyond those of other men.\"\\n\\n\"my dear miss elliot!\" exclaimed mrs clay, lifting her hands and eyes,\\nand sinking all the rest of her astonishment in a convenient silence.\\n\\n\"well, my dear penelope, you need not be so alarmed about him.\\ni did invite him, you know.  i sent him away with smiles.\\nwhen i found he was really going to his friends at thornberry park\\nfor the whole day to-morrow, i had compassion on him.\"\\n\\nanne admired the good acting of the friend, in being able to shew\\nsuch pleasure as she did, in the expectation and in the actual arrival\\nof the very person whose presence must really be interfering with\\nher prime object.  it was impossible but that mrs clay must hate\\nthe sight of mr elliot; and yet she could assume a most obliging,\\nplacid look, and appear quite satisfied with the curtailed license\\nof devoting herself only half as much to sir walter as she would have\\ndone otherwise.\\n\\nto anne herself it was most distressing to see mr elliot enter the room;\\nand quite painful to have him approach and speak to her.\\nshe had been used before to feel that he could not be always quite sincere,\\nbut now she saw insincerity in everything.  his attentive deference\\nto her father, contrasted with his former language, was odious;\\nand when she thought of his cruel conduct towards mrs smith,\\nshe could hardly bear the sight of his present smiles and mildness,\\nor the sound of his artificial good sentiments.\\n\\nshe meant to avoid any such alteration of manners as might provoke\\na remonstrance on his side.  it was a great object to her to escape\\nall enquiry or eclat; but it was her intention to be as decidedly cool\\nto him as might be compatible with their relationship; and to retrace,\\nas quietly as she could, the few steps of unnecessary intimacy she had\\nbeen gradually led along.  she was accordingly more guarded,\\nand more cool, than she had been the night before.\\n\\nhe wanted to animate her curiosity again as to how and where\\nhe could have heard her formerly praised; wanted very much\\nto be gratified by more solicitation; but the charm was broken:\\nhe found that the heat and animation of a public room was necessary\\nto kindle his modest cousin\\'s vanity; he found, at least, that it was\\nnot to be done now, by any of those attempts which he could hazard\\namong the too-commanding claims of the others.  he little surmised\\nthat it was a subject acting now exactly against his interest,\\nbringing immediately to her thoughts all those parts of his conduct\\nwhich were least excusable.\\n\\nshe had some satisfaction in finding that he was really going out of bath\\nthe next morning, going early, and that he would be gone the greater part\\nof two days.  he was invited again to camden place the very evening of\\nhis return; but from thursday to saturday evening his absence was certain.\\nit was bad enough that a mrs clay should be always before her;\\nbut that a deeper hypocrite should be added to their party,\\nseemed the destruction of everything like peace and comfort.\\nit was so humiliating to reflect on the constant deception practised\\non her father and elizabeth; to consider the various sources\\nof mortification preparing for them!  mrs clay\\'s selfishness was\\nnot so complicate nor so revolting as his; and anne would have compounded\\nfor the marriage at once, with all its evils, to be clear of mr elliot\\'s\\nsubtleties in endeavouring to prevent it.\\n\\non friday morning she meant to go very early to lady russell,\\nand accomplish the necessary communication; and she would have gone\\ndirectly after breakfast, but that mrs clay was also going out\\non some obliging purpose of saving her sister trouble, which\\ndetermined her to wait till she might be safe from such a companion.\\nshe saw mrs clay fairly off, therefore, before she began to talk\\nof spending the morning in rivers street.\\n\\n\"very well,\" said elizabeth, \"i have nothing to send but my love.\\noh! you may as well take back that tiresome book she would lend me,\\nand pretend i have read it through.  i really cannot be plaguing myself\\nfor ever with all the new poems and states of the nation that come out.\\nlady russell quite bores one with her new publications.\\nyou need not tell her so, but i thought her dress hideous the other night.\\ni used to think she had some taste in dress, but i was ashamed of her\\nat the concert.  something so formal and arrange in her air!\\nand she sits so upright!  my best love, of course.\"\\n\\n\"and mine,\" added sir walter.  \"kindest regards.  and you may say,\\nthat i mean to call upon her soon.  make a civil message;\\nbut i shall only leave my card.  morning visits are never fair\\nby women at her time of life, who make themselves up so little.\\nif she would only wear rouge she would not be afraid of being seen;\\nbut last time i called, i observed the blinds were let down immediately.\"\\n\\nwhile her father spoke, there was a knock at the door.  who could it be?\\nanne, remembering the preconcerted visits, at all hours, of mr elliot,\\nwould have expected him, but for his known engagement seven miles off.\\nafter the usual period of suspense, the usual sounds of approach were heard,\\nand \"mr and mrs charles musgrove\" were ushered into the room.\\n\\nsurprise was the strongest emotion raised by their appearance;\\nbut anne was really glad to see them; and the others were not so sorry\\nbut that they could put on a decent air of welcome; and as soon\\nas it became clear that these, their nearest relations, were not arrived\\nwith an views of accommodation in that house, sir walter and elizabeth\\nwere able to rise in cordiality, and do the honours of it very well.\\nthey were come to bath for a few days with mrs musgrove, and were\\nat the white hart.  so much was pretty soon understood;\\nbut till sir walter and elizabeth were walking mary into\\nthe other drawing-room, and regaling themselves with her admiration,\\nanne could not draw upon charles\\'s brain for a regular history\\nof their coming, or an explanation of some smiling hints\\nof particular business, which had been ostentatiously dropped by mary,\\nas well as of some apparent confusion as to whom their party consisted of.\\n\\nshe then found that it consisted of mrs musgrove, henrietta,\\nand captain harville, beside their two selves.  he gave her a very plain,\\nintelligible account of the whole; a narration in which she saw\\na great deal of most characteristic proceeding.  the scheme\\nhad received its first impulse by captain harville\\'s wanting to\\ncome to bath on business.  he had begun to talk of it a week ago;\\nand by way of doing something, as shooting was over, charles had proposed\\ncoming with him, and mrs harville had seemed to like the idea of it\\nvery much, as an advantage to her husband; but mary could not bear\\nto be left, and had made herself so unhappy about it, that for a day or two\\neverything seemed to be in suspense, or at an end.  but then,\\nit had been taken up by his father and mother.  his mother had\\nsome old friends in bath whom she wanted to see; it was thought\\na good opportunity for henrietta to come and buy wedding-clothes\\nfor herself and her sister; and, in short, it ended in being\\nhis mother\\'s party, that everything might be comfortable and easy\\nto captain harville; and he and mary were included in it\\nby way of general convenience.  they had arrived late the night before.\\nmrs harville, her children, and captain benwick, remained with\\nmr musgrove and louisa at uppercross.\\n\\nanne\\'s only surprise was, that affairs should be in forwardness enough\\nfor henrietta\\'s wedding-clothes to be talked of.  she had imagined\\nsuch difficulties of fortune to exist there as must prevent\\nthe marriage from being near at hand; but she learned from charles that,\\nvery recently, (since mary\\'s last letter to herself), charles hayter\\nhad been applied to by a friend to hold a living for a youth\\nwho could not possibly claim it under many years; and that\\non the strength of his present income, with almost a certainty\\nof something more permanent long before the term in question,\\nthe two families had consented to the young people\\'s wishes,\\nand that their marriage was likely to take place in a few months,\\nquite as soon as louisa\\'s.  \"and a very good living it was,\"\\ncharles added:  \"only five-and-twenty miles from uppercross,\\nand in a very fine country:   fine part of dorsetshire.\\nin the centre of some of the best preserves in the kingdom,\\nsurrounded by three great proprietors, each more careful and jealous\\nthan the other; and to two of the three at least, charles hayter might get\\na special recommendation.  not that he will value it as he ought,\"\\nhe observed, \"charles is too cool about sporting. that\\'s the worst of him.\"\\n\\n\"i am extremely glad, indeed,\" cried anne, \"particularly glad\\nthat this should happen; and that of two sisters, who both deserve\\nequally well, and who have always been such good friends,\\nthe pleasant prospect of one should not be dimming those of the other--\\nthat they should be so equal in their prosperity and comfort.\\ni hope your father and mother are quite happy with regard to both.\"\\n\\n\"oh! yes.  my father would be well pleased if the gentlemen were richer,\\nbut he has no other fault to find.  money, you know, coming down with\\nmoney--two daughters at once--it cannot be a very agreeable operation,\\nand it streightens him as to many things.  however, i do not mean to say\\nthey have not a right to it.  it is very fit they should have\\ndaughters\\' shares; and i am sure he has always been a very kind,\\nliberal father to me.  mary does not above half like henrietta\\'s match.\\nshe never did, you know.  but she does not do him justice,\\nnor think enough about winthrop.  i cannot make her attend to\\nthe value of the property.  it is a very fair match, as times go;\\nand i have liked charles hayter all my life, and i shall not leave off now.\"\\n\\n\"such excellent parents as mr and mrs musgrove,\" exclaimed anne,\\n\"should be happy in their children\\'s marriages.  they do everything\\nto confer happiness, i am sure.  what a blessing to young people\\nto be in such hands!  your father and mother seem so totally free\\nfrom all those ambitious feelings which have led to so much misconduct\\nand misery, both in young and old.  i hope you think louisa\\nperfectly recovered now?\"\\n\\nhe answered rather hesitatingly, \"yes, i believe i do; very much recovered;\\nbut she is altered; there is no running or jumping about, no laughing\\nor dancing; it is quite different.  if one happens only to shut the door\\na little hard, she starts and wriggles like a young dab-chick in the water;\\nand benwick sits at her elbow, reading verses, or whispering to her,\\nall day long.\"\\n\\nanne could not help laughing.  \"that cannot be much to your taste,\\ni know,\" said she; \"but i do believe him to be an excellent young man.\"\\n\\n\"to be sure he is.  nobody doubts it; and i hope you do not think\\ni am so illiberal as to want every man to have the same objects and\\npleasures as myself.  i have a great value for benwick; and when one can\\nbut get him to talk, he has plenty to say.  his reading has done him\\nno harm, for he has fought as well as read.  he is a brave fellow.\\ni got more acquainted with him last monday than ever i did before.\\nwe had a famous set-to at rat-hunting all the morning in\\nmy father\\'s great barns; and he played his part so well\\nthat i have liked him the better ever since.\"\\n\\nhere they were interrupted by the absolute necessity of charles\\'s\\nfollowing the others to admire mirrors and china; but anne had\\nheard enough to understand the present state of uppercross,\\nand rejoice in its happiness; and though she sighed as she rejoiced,\\nher sigh had none of the ill-will of envy in it.  she would certainly\\nhave risen to their blessings if she could, but she did not want\\nto lessen theirs.\\n\\nthe visit passed off altogether in high good humour.  mary was\\nin excellent spirits, enjoying the gaiety and the change,\\nand so well satisfied with the journey in her mother-in-law\\'s carriage\\nwith four horses, and with her own complete independence of camden place,\\nthat she was exactly in a temper to admire everything as she ought,\\nand enter most readily into all the superiorities of the house,\\nas they were detailed to her.  she had no demands on her father or sister,\\nand her consequence was just enough increased by their handsome\\ndrawing-rooms.\\n\\nelizabeth was, for a short time, suffering a good deal.\\nshe felt that mrs musgrove and all her party ought to be asked\\nto dine with them; but she could not bear to have the difference of style,\\nthe reduction of servants, which a dinner must betray, witnessed by those\\nwho had been always so inferior to the elliots of kellynch.\\nit was a struggle between propriety and vanity; but vanity got the better,\\nand then elizabeth was happy again.  these were her internal persuasions:\\n\"old fashioned notions; country hospitality; we do not profess\\nto give dinners; few people in bath do; lady alicia never does;\\ndid not even ask her own sister\\'s family, though they were here a month:\\nand i dare say it would be very inconvenient to mrs musgrove;\\nput her quite out of her way.  i am sure she would rather not come;\\nshe cannot feel easy with us.  i will ask them all for an evening;\\nthat will be much better; that will be a novelty and a treat.\\nthey have not seen two such drawing rooms before.  they will be delighted\\nto come to-morrow evening.  it shall be a regular party, small,\\nbut most elegant.\"  and this satisfied elizabeth:  and when the invitation\\nwas given to the two present, and promised for the absent,\\nmary was as completely satisfied.  she was particularly asked\\nto meet mr elliot, and be introduced to lady dalrymple and miss carteret,\\nwho were fortunately already engaged to come; and she could not\\nhave received a more gratifying attention.  miss elliot was to have\\nthe honour of calling on mrs musgrove in the course of the morning;\\nand anne walked off with charles and mary, to go and see her\\nand henrietta directly.\\n\\nher plan of sitting with lady russell must give way for the present.\\nthey all three called in rivers street for a couple of minutes;\\nbut anne convinced herself that a day\\'s delay of the intended communication\\ncould be of no consequence, and hastened forward to the white hart,\\nto see again the friends and companions of the last autumn,\\nwith an eagerness of good-will which many associations contributed to form.\\n\\nthey found mrs musgrove and her daughter within, and by themselves,\\nand anne had the kindest welcome from each.  henrietta was exactly\\nin that state of recently-improved views, of fresh-formed happiness,\\nwhich made her full of regard and interest for everybody she had\\never liked before at all; and mrs musgrove\\'s real affection had been won\\nby her usefulness when they were in distress.  it was a heartiness,\\nand a warmth, and a sincerity which anne delighted in the more,\\nfrom the sad want of such blessings at home.  she was entreated\\nto give them as much of her time as possible, invited for every day\\nand all day long, or rather claimed as part of the family; and, in return,\\nshe naturally fell into all her wonted ways of attention and assistance,\\nand on charles\\'s leaving them together, was listening to mrs musgrove\\'s\\nhistory of louisa, and to henrietta\\'s of herself, giving opinions\\non business, and recommendations to shops; with intervals of every help\\nwhich mary required, from altering her ribbon to settling her accounts;\\nfrom finding her keys, and assorting her trinkets, to trying\\nto convince her that she was not ill-used by anybody; which mary,\\nwell amused as she generally was, in her station at a window\\noverlooking the entrance to the pump room, could not but have\\nher moments of imagining.\\n\\na morning of thorough confusion was to be expected.  a large party\\nin an hotel ensured a quick-changing, unsettled scene.  one five minutes\\nbrought a note, the next a parcel; and anne had not been there\\nhalf an hour, when their dining-room, spacious as it was,\\nseemed more than half filled:  a party of steady old friends\\nwere seated around mrs musgrove, and charles came back with\\ncaptains harville and wentworth.  the appearance of the latter\\ncould not be more than the surprise of the moment.  it was impossible\\nfor her to have forgotten to feel that this arrival of their\\ncommon friends must be soon bringing them together again.\\ntheir last meeting had been most important in opening his feelings;\\nshe had derived from it a delightful conviction; but she feared\\nfrom his looks, that the same unfortunate persuasion, which had\\nhastened him away from the concert room, still governed.\\nhe did not seem to want to be near enough for conversation.\\n\\nshe tried to be calm, and leave things to take their course,\\nand tried to dwell much on this argument of rational dependence:--\\n\"surely, if there be constant attachment on each side, our hearts\\nmust understand each other ere long.  we are not boy and girl,\\nto be captiously irritable, misled by every moment\\'s inadvertence,\\nand wantonly playing with our own happiness.\"  and yet,\\na few minutes afterwards, she felt as if their being in company\\nwith each other, under their present circumstances, could only be\\nexposing them to inadvertencies and misconstructions of the most\\nmischievous kind.\\n\\n\"anne,\" cried mary, still at her window, \"there is mrs clay,\\ni am sure, standing under the colonnade, and a gentleman with her.\\ni saw them turn the corner from bath street just now.  they seemed\\ndeep in talk.  who is it?  come, and tell me.  good heavens! i recollect.\\nit is mr elliot himself.\"\\n\\n\"no,\" cried anne, quickly, \"it cannot be mr elliot, i assure you.\\nhe was to leave bath at nine this morning, and does not come back\\ntill to-morrow.\"\\n\\nas she spoke, she felt that captain wentworth was looking at her,\\nthe consciousness of which vexed and embarrassed her, and made her regret\\nthat she had said so much, simple as it was.\\n\\nmary, resenting that she should be supposed not to know her own cousin,\\nbegan talking very warmly about the family features, and protesting\\nstill more positively that it was mr elliot, calling again upon anne\\nto come and look for herself, but anne did not mean to stir,\\nand tried to be cool and unconcerned.  her distress returned,\\nhowever, on perceiving smiles and intelligent glances pass between\\ntwo or three of the lady visitors, as if they believed themselves\\nquite in the secret.  it was evident that the report concerning her\\nhad spread, and a short pause succeeded, which seemed to ensure\\nthat it would now spread farther.\\n\\n\"do come, anne\" cried mary, \"come and look yourself.  you will be too late\\nif you do not make haste.  they are parting; they are shaking hands.\\nhe is turning away.  not know mr elliot, indeed!  you seem to have\\nforgot all about lyme.\"\\n\\nto pacify mary, and perhaps screen her own embarrassment,\\nanne did move quietly to the window.  she was just in time to ascertain\\nthat it really was mr elliot, which she had never believed,\\nbefore he disappeared on one side, as mrs clay walked quickly off\\non the other; and checking the surprise which she could not but feel\\nat such an appearance of friendly conference between two persons\\nof totally opposite interest, she calmly said, \"yes, it is mr elliot,\\ncertainly.  he has changed his hour of going, i suppose, that is all,\\nor i may be mistaken, i might not attend;\" and walked back to her chair,\\nrecomposed, and with the comfortable hope of having acquitted herself well.\\n\\nthe visitors took their leave; and charles, having civilly seen them off,\\nand then made a face at them, and abused them for coming, began with--\\n\\n\"well, mother, i have done something for you that you will like.\\ni have been to the theatre, and secured a box for to-morrow night.\\na\\'n\\'t i a good boy?  i know you love a play; and there is room for us all.\\nit holds nine.  i have engaged captain wentworth.  anne will\\nnot be sorry to join us, i am sure.  we all like a play.\\nhave not i done well, mother?\"\\n\\nmrs musgrove was good humouredly beginning to express her perfect readiness\\nfor the play, if henrietta and all the others liked it, when mary\\neagerly interrupted her by exclaiming--\\n\\n\"good heavens, charles! how can you think of such a thing?\\ntake a box for to-morrow night!  have you forgot that we are engaged\\nto camden place to-morrow night? and that we were most particularly asked\\nto meet lady dalrymple and her daughter, and mr elliot, and all\\nthe principal family connexions, on purpose to be introduced to them?\\nhow can you be so forgetful?\"\\n\\n\"phoo! phoo!\" replied charles, \"what\\'s an evening party?\\nnever worth remembering.  your father might have asked us to dinner,\\ni think, if he had wanted to see us.  you may do as you like,\\nbut i shall go to the play.\"\\n\\n\"oh! charles, i declare it will be too abominable if you do,\\nwhen you promised to go.\"\\n\\n\"no, i did not promise.  i only smirked and bowed, and said the word\\n`happy.\\'  there was no promise.\"\\n\\n\"but you must go, charles.  it would be unpardonable to fail.\\nwe were asked on purpose to be introduced.  there was always\\nsuch a great connexion between the dalrymples and ourselves.\\nnothing ever happened on either side that was not announced immediately.\\nwe are quite near relations, you know; and mr elliot too,\\nwhom you ought so particularly to be acquainted with!  every attention\\nis due to mr elliot.  consider, my father\\'s heir:  the future\\nrepresentative of the family.\"\\n\\n\"don\\'t talk to me about heirs and representatives,\" cried charles.\\n\"i am not one of those who neglect the reigning power to bow\\nto the rising sun.  if i would not go for the sake of your father,\\ni should think it scandalous to go for the sake of his heir.\\nwhat is mr elliot to me?\"  the careless expression was life to anne,\\nwho saw that captain wentworth was all attention, looking and\\nlistening with his whole soul; and that the last words brought\\nhis enquiring eyes from charles to herself.\\n\\ncharles and mary still talked on in the same style; he, half serious\\nand half jesting, maintaining the scheme for the play, and she,\\ninvariably serious, most warmly opposing it, and not omitting\\nto make it known that, however determined to go to camden place herself,\\nshe should not think herself very well used, if they went to the play\\nwithout her.  mrs musgrove interposed.\\n\\n\"we had better put it off.  charles, you had much better go back\\nand change the box for tuesday.  it would be a pity to be divided,\\nand we should be losing miss anne, too, if there is a party at her father\\'s;\\nand i am sure neither henrietta nor i should care at all for the play,\\nif miss anne could not be with us.\"\\n\\nanne felt truly obliged to her for such kindness; and quite as much\\nso for the opportunity it gave her of decidedly saying--\\n\\n\"if it depended only on my inclination, ma\\'am, the party at home\\n(excepting on mary\\'s account) would not be the smallest impediment.\\ni have no pleasure in the sort of meeting, and should be too happy\\nto change it for a play, and with you.  but, it had better\\nnot be attempted, perhaps.\"  she had spoken it; but she trembled\\nwhen it was done, conscious that her words were listened to,\\nand daring not even to try to observe their effect.\\n\\nit was soon generally agreed that tuesday should be the day;\\ncharles only reserving the advantage of still teasing his wife,\\nby persisting that he would go to the play to-morrow if nobody else would.\\n\\ncaptain wentworth left his seat, and walked to the fire-place;\\nprobably for the sake of walking away from it soon afterwards,\\nand taking a station, with less bare-faced design, by anne.\\n\\n\"you have not been long enough in bath,\" said he, \"to enjoy\\nthe evening parties of the place.\"\\n\\n\"oh! no.  the usual character of them has nothing for me.\\ni am no card-player.\"\\n\\n\"you were not formerly, i know.  you did not use to like cards;\\nbut time makes many changes.\"\\n\\n\"i am not yet so much changed,\" cried anne, and stopped, fearing she\\nhardly knew what misconstruction.  after waiting a few moments\\nhe said, and as if it were the result of immediate feeling,\\n\"it is a period, indeed!  eight years and a half is a period.\"\\n\\nwhether he would have proceeded farther was left to anne\\'s imagination\\nto ponder over in a calmer hour; for while still hearing the sounds\\nhe had uttered, she was startled to other subjects by henrietta,\\neager to make use of the present leisure for getting out,\\nand calling on her companions to lose no time, lest somebody else\\nshould come in.\\n\\nthey were obliged to move.  anne talked of being perfectly ready,\\nand tried to look it; but she felt that could henrietta have known\\nthe regret and reluctance of her heart in quitting that chair,\\nin preparing to quit the room, she would have found, in all her own\\nsensations for her cousin, in the very security of his affection,\\nwherewith to pity her.\\n\\ntheir preparations, however, were stopped short.  alarming sounds\\nwere heard; other visitors approached, and the door was thrown open\\nfor sir walter and miss elliot, whose entrance seemed to give\\na general chill.  anne felt an instant oppression, and wherever she looked\\nsaw symptoms of the same.  the comfort, the freedom, the gaiety\\nof the room was over, hushed into cold composure, determined silence,\\nor insipid talk, to meet the heartless elegance of her father and sister.\\nhow mortifying to feel that it was so!\\n\\nher jealous eye was satisfied in one particular.  captain wentworth\\nwas acknowledged again by each, by elizabeth more graciously than before.\\nshe even addressed him once, and looked at him more than once.\\nelizabeth was, in fact, revolving a great measure.  the sequel\\nexplained it.  after the waste of a few minutes in saying\\nthe proper nothings, she began to give the invitation which\\nwas to comprise all the remaining dues of the musgroves.\\n\"to-morrow evening, to meet a few friends:  no formal party.\"\\nit was all said very gracefully, and the cards with which she had\\nprovided herself, the \"miss elliot at home,\" were laid on the table,\\nwith a courteous, comprehensive smile to all, and one smile and\\none card more decidedly for captain wentworth.  the truth was,\\nthat elizabeth had been long enough in bath to understand\\nthe importance of a man of such an air and appearance as his.\\nthe past was nothing.  the present was that captain wentworth\\nwould move about well in her drawing-room.  the card was pointedly given,\\nand sir walter and elizabeth arose and disappeared.\\n\\nthe interruption had been short, though severe, and ease and animation\\nreturned to most of those they left as the door shut them out,\\nbut not to anne.  she could think only of the invitation she had\\nwith such astonishment witnessed, and of the manner in which\\nit had been received; a manner of doubtful meaning, of surprise rather\\nthan gratification, of polite acknowledgement rather than acceptance.\\nshe knew him; she saw disdain in his eye, and could not venture to believe\\nthat he had determined to accept such an offering, as an atonement\\nfor all the insolence of the past.  her spirits sank.  he held the card\\nin his hand after they were gone, as if deeply considering it.\\n\\n\"only think of elizabeth\\'s including everybody!\" whispered mary\\nvery audibly.  \"i do not wonder captain wentworth is delighted!\\nyou see he cannot put the card out of his hand.\"\\n\\nanne caught his eye, saw his cheeks glow, and his mouth form itself\\ninto a momentary expression of contempt, and turned away,\\nthat she might neither see nor hear more to vex her.\\n\\nthe party separated.  the gentlemen had their own pursuits,\\nthe ladies proceeded on their own business, and they met no more while\\nanne belonged to them.  she was earnestly begged to return and dine,\\nand give them all the rest of the day, but her spirits had been\\nso long exerted that at present she felt unequal to more,\\nand fit only for home, where she might be sure of being as silent\\nas she chose.\\n\\npromising to be with them the whole of the following morning, therefore,\\nshe closed the fatigues of the present by a toilsome walk to camden place,\\nthere to spend the evening chiefly in listening to the busy arrangements\\nof elizabeth and mrs clay for the morrow\\'s party, the frequent enumeration\\nof the persons invited, and the continually improving detail of all\\nthe embellishments which were to make it the most completely elegant\\nof its kind in bath, while harassing herself with the never-ending\\nquestion, of whether captain wentworth would come or not?  they were\\nreckoning him as certain, but with her it was a gnawing solicitude\\nnever appeased for five minutes together.  she generally thought\\nhe would come, because she generally thought he ought; but it was a case\\nwhich she could not so shape into any positive act of duty or discretion,\\nas inevitably to defy the suggestions of very opposite feelings.\\n\\nshe only roused herself from the broodings of this restless agitation,\\nto let mrs clay know that she had been seen with mr elliot\\nthree hours after his being supposed to be out of bath,\\nfor having watched in vain for some intimation of the interview\\nfrom the lady herself, she determined to mention it, and it seemed to her\\nthere was guilt in mrs clay\\'s face as she listened.  it was transient:\\ncleared away in an instant; but anne could imagine she read there\\nthe consciousness of having, by some complication of mutual trick,\\nor some overbearing authority of his, been obliged to attend\\n(perhaps for half an hour) to his lectures and restrictions on her designs\\non sir walter.  she exclaimed, however, with a very tolerable\\nimitation of nature: --\\n\\n\"oh! dear! very true.  only think, miss elliot, to my great surprise\\ni met with mr elliot in bath street.  i was never more astonished.\\nhe turned back and walked with me to the pump yard.  he had been prevented\\nsetting off for thornberry, but i really forget by what;\\nfor i was in a hurry, and could not much attend, and i can only answer\\nfor his being determined not to be delayed in his return.\\nhe wanted to know how early he might be admitted to-morrow.\\nhe was full of `to-morrow,\\' and it is very evident that i have been\\nfull of it too, ever since i entered the house, and learnt the extension\\nof your plan and all that had happened, or my seeing him could never have\\ngone so entirely out of my head.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 23\\n\\n\\none day only had passed since anne\\'s conversation with mrs smith;\\nbut a keener interest had succeeded, and she was now so little touched\\nby mr elliot\\'s conduct, except by its effects in one quarter,\\nthat it became a matter of course the next morning, still to defer\\nher explanatory visit in rivers street.  she had promised to be\\nwith the musgroves from breakfast to dinner.  her faith was plighted,\\nand mr elliot\\'s character, like the sultaness scheherazade\\'s head,\\nmust live another day.\\n\\nshe could not keep her appointment punctually, however;\\nthe weather was unfavourable, and she had grieved over the rain\\non her friends\\' account, and felt it very much on her own,\\nbefore she was able to attempt the walk.  when she reached the white hart,\\nand made her way to the proper apartment, she found herself\\nneither arriving quite in time, nor the first to arrive.\\nthe party before her were, mrs musgrove, talking to mrs croft,\\nand captain harville to captain wentworth; and she immediately heard\\nthat mary and henrietta, too impatient to wait, had gone out the moment\\nit had cleared, but would be back again soon, and that the strictest\\ninjunctions had been left with mrs musgrove to keep her there\\ntill they returned.  she had only to submit, sit down,\\nbe outwardly composed, and feel herself plunged at once\\nin all the agitations which she had merely laid her account of\\ntasting a little before the morning closed.  there was no delay,\\nno waste of time.  she was deep in the happiness of such misery,\\nor the misery of such happiness, instantly.  two minutes after\\nher entering the room, captain wentworth said--\\n\\n\"we will write the letter we were talking of, harville, now,\\nif you will give me materials.\"\\n\\nmaterials were at hand, on a separate table; he went to it,\\nand nearly turning his back to them all, was engrossed by writing.\\n\\nmrs musgrove was giving mrs croft the history of her eldest\\ndaughter\\'s engagement, and just in that inconvenient tone of voice\\nwhich was perfectly audible while it pretended to be a whisper.\\nanne felt that she did not belong to the conversation, and yet,\\nas captain harville seemed thoughtful and not disposed to talk,\\nshe could not avoid hearing many undesirable particulars; such as,\\n\"how mr musgrove and my brother hayter had met again and again\\nto talk it over; what my brother hayter had said one day,\\nand what mr musgrove had proposed the next, and what had occurred\\nto my sister hayter, and what the young people had wished, and what\\ni said at first i never could consent to, but was afterwards persuaded\\nto think might do very well,\" and a great deal in the same style\\nof open-hearted communication:  minutiae which, even with every advantage\\nof taste and delicacy, which good mrs musgrove could not give,\\ncould be properly interesting only to the principals.  mrs croft\\nwas attending with great good-humour, and whenever she spoke at all,\\nit was very sensibly.  anne hoped the gentlemen might each be\\ntoo much self-occupied to hear.\\n\\n\"and so, ma\\'am, all these thing considered,\" said mrs musgrove,\\nin her powerful whisper, \"though we could have wished it different,\\nyet, altogether, we did not think it fair to stand out any longer,\\nfor charles hayter was quite wild about it, and henrietta was\\npretty near as bad; and so we thought they had better marry at once,\\nand make the best of it, as many others have done before them.\\nat any rate, said i, it will be better than a long engagement.\"\\n\\n\"that is precisely what i was going to observe,\" cried mrs croft.\\n\"i would rather have young people settle on a small income at once,\\nand have to struggle with a few difficulties together, than be\\ninvolved in a long engagement.  i always think that no mutual--\"\\n\\n\"oh! dear mrs croft,\" cried mrs musgrove, unable to let her\\nfinish her speech, \"there is nothing i so abominate for young people\\nas a long engagement.  it is what i always protested against\\nfor my children.  it is all very well, i used to say, for young people\\nto be engaged, if there is a certainty of their being able to marry\\nin six months, or even in twelve; but a long engagement--\"\\n\\n\"yes, dear ma\\'am,\" said mrs croft, \"or an uncertain engagement,\\nan engagement which may be long.  to begin without knowing\\nthat at such a time there will be the means of marrying,\\ni hold to be very unsafe and unwise, and what i think all parents\\nshould prevent as far as they can.\"\\n\\nanne found an unexpected interest here.  she felt its application\\nto herself, felt it in a nervous thrill all over her; and at the same\\nmoment that her eyes instinctively glanced towards the distant table,\\ncaptain wentworth\\'s pen ceased to move, his head was raised, pausing,\\nlistening, and he turned round the next instant to give a look,\\none quick, conscious look at her.\\n\\nthe two ladies continued to talk, to re-urge the same admitted truths,\\nand enforce them with such examples of the ill effect of\\na contrary practice as had fallen within their observation,\\nbut anne heard nothing distinctly; it was only a buzz of words in her ear,\\nher mind was in confusion.\\n\\ncaptain harville, who had in truth been hearing none of it,\\nnow left his seat, and moved to a window, and anne seeming to watch him,\\nthough it was from thorough absence of mind, became gradually sensible\\nthat he was inviting her to join him where he stood.  he looked at her\\nwith a smile, and a little motion of the head, which expressed,\\n\"come to me, i have something to say;\" and the unaffected,\\neasy kindness of manner which denoted the feelings of an older acquaintance\\nthan he really was, strongly enforced the invitation.  she roused herself\\nand went to him.  the window at which he stood was at the other end\\nof the room from where the two ladies were sitting, and though nearer\\nto captain wentworth\\'s table, not very near.  as she joined him,\\ncaptain harville\\'s countenance re-assumed the serious, thoughtful\\nexpression which seemed its natural character.\\n\\n\"look here,\" said he, unfolding a parcel in his hand, and displaying\\na small miniature painting, \"do you know who that is?\"\\n\\n\"certainly:  captain benwick.\"\\n\\n\"yes, and you may guess who it is for.  but,\" (in a deep tone,)\\n\"it was not done for her.  miss elliot, do you remember our\\nwalking together at lyme, and grieving for him?  i little thought then--\\nbut no matter.  this was drawn at the cape.  he met with\\na clever young german artist at the cape, and in compliance with a promise\\nto my poor sister, sat to him, and was bringing it home for her;\\nand i have now the charge of getting it properly set for another!\\nit was a commission to me!  but who else was there to employ?\\ni hope i can allow for him.  i am not sorry, indeed, to make it\\nover to another.  he undertakes it;\" (looking towards captain wentworth,)\\n\"he is writing about it now.\"  and with a quivering lip he wound up\\nthe whole by adding, \"poor fanny! she would not have forgotten him so soon!\"\\n\\n\"no,\" replied anne, in a low, feeling voice. \"that i can easily believe.\"\\n\\n\"it was not in her nature.  she doted on him.\"\\n\\n\"it would not be the nature of any woman who truly loved.\"\\n\\ncaptain harville smiled, as much as to say, \"do you claim that\\nfor your sex?\" and she answered the question, smiling also,\\n\"yes.  we certainly do not forget you as soon as you forget us.\\nit is, perhaps, our fate rather than our merit.  we cannot help ourselves.\\nwe live at home, quiet, confined, and our feelings prey upon us.\\nyou are forced on exertion.  you have always a profession, pursuits,\\nbusiness of some sort or other, to take you back into the world immediately,\\nand continual occupation and change soon weaken impressions.\"\\n\\n\"granting your assertion that the world does all this so soon for men\\n(which, however, i do not think i shall grant), it does not apply\\nto benwick.  he has not been forced upon any exertion.  the peace\\nturned him on shore at the very moment, and he has been living with us,\\nin our little family circle, ever since.\"\\n\\n\"true,\" said anne, \"very true; i did not recollect; but what shall\\nwe say now, captain harville?  if the change be not from\\noutward circumstances, it must be from within; it must be nature,\\nman\\'s nature, which has done the business for captain benwick.\"\\n\\n\"no, no, it is not man\\'s nature.  i will not allow it to be more\\nman\\'s nature than woman\\'s to be inconstant and forget those they do love,\\nor have loved.  i believe the reverse.  i believe in a true analogy\\nbetween our bodily frames and our mental; and that as our bodies are\\nthe strongest, so are our feelings; capable of bearing most rough usage,\\nand riding out the heaviest weather.\"\\n\\n\"your feelings may be the strongest,\" replied anne, \"but the same spirit\\nof analogy will authorise me to assert that ours are the most tender.\\nman is more robust than woman, but he is not longer lived;\\nwhich exactly explains my view of the nature of their attachments.\\nnay, it would be too hard upon you, if it were otherwise.\\nyou have difficulties, and privations, and dangers enough to struggle with.\\nyou are always labouring and toiling, exposed to every risk and hardship.\\nyour home, country, friends, all quitted.  neither time, nor health,\\nnor life, to be called your own.  it would be hard, indeed\"\\n(with a faltering voice), \"if woman\\'s feelings were to be\\nadded to all this.\"\\n\\n\"we shall never agree upon this question,\" captain harville\\nwas beginning to say, when a slight noise called their attention\\nto captain wentworth\\'s hitherto perfectly quiet division of the room.\\nit was nothing more than that his pen had fallen down; but anne was\\nstartled at finding him nearer than she had supposed, and half inclined\\nto suspect that the pen had only fallen because he had been\\noccupied by them, striving to catch sounds, which yet she did not think\\nhe could have caught.\\n\\n\"have you finished your letter?\" said captain harville.\\n\\n\"not quite, a few lines more.  i shall have done in five minutes.\"\\n\\n\"there is no hurry on my side.  i am only ready whenever you are.\\ni am in very good anchorage here,\" (smiling at anne,) \"well supplied,\\nand want for nothing.  no hurry for a signal at all.  well, miss elliot,\"\\n(lowering his voice,) \"as i was saying we shall never agree,\\ni suppose, upon this point.  no man and woman, would, probably.\\nbut let me observe that all histories are against you--all stories,\\nprose and verse.  if i had such a memory as benwick, i could bring you\\nfifty quotations in a moment on my side the argument, and i do not think\\ni ever opened a book in my life which had not something to say\\nupon woman\\'s inconstancy.  songs and proverbs, all talk\\nof woman\\'s fickleness.  but perhaps you will say, these were all\\nwritten by men.\"\\n\\n\"perhaps i shall.  yes, yes, if you please, no reference to examples\\nin books.  men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story.\\neducation has been theirs in so much higher a degree; the pen has\\nbeen in their hands.  i will not allow books to prove anything.\"\\n\\n\"but how shall we prove anything?\"\\n\\n\"we never shall.  we never can expect to prove any thing upon such a point.\\nit is a difference of opinion which does not admit of proof.\\nwe each begin, probably, with a little bias towards our own sex;\\nand upon that bias build every circumstance in favour of it\\nwhich has occurred within our own circle; many of which circumstances\\n(perhaps those very cases which strike us the most) may be precisely such\\nas cannot be brought forward without betraying a confidence,\\nor in some respect saying what should not be said.\"\\n\\n\"ah!\" cried captain harville, in a tone of strong feeling,\\n\"if i could but make you comprehend what a man suffers when he takes\\na last look at his wife and children, and watches the boat\\nthat he has sent them off in, as long as it is in sight,\\nand then turns away and says, `god knows whether we ever meet again!\\'\\nand then, if i could convey to you the glow of his soul when he does\\nsee them again; when, coming back after a twelvemonth\\'s absence,\\nperhaps, and obliged to put into another port, he calculates how soon\\nit be possible to get them there, pretending to deceive himself,\\nand saying, `they cannot be here till such a day,\\' but all the while\\nhoping for them twelve hours sooner, and seeing them arrive at last,\\nas if heaven had given them wings, by many hours sooner still!\\nif i could explain to you all this, and all that a man can bear and do,\\nand glories to do, for the sake of these treasures of his existence!\\ni speak, you know, only of such men as have hearts!\" pressing his own\\nwith emotion.\\n\\n\"oh!\" cried anne eagerly, \"i hope i do justice to all that is felt by you,\\nand by those who resemble you.  god forbid that i should undervalue\\nthe warm and faithful feelings of any of my fellow-creatures!\\ni should deserve utter contempt if i dared to suppose that true attachment\\nand constancy were known only by woman.  no, i believe you capable\\nof everything great and good in your married lives.  i believe you equal\\nto every important exertion, and to every domestic forbearance,\\nso long as--if i may be allowed the expression--so long as you have\\nan object.  i mean while the woman you love lives, and lives for you.\\nall the privilege i claim for my own sex (it is not a very enviable one;\\nyou need not covet it), is that of loving longest, when existence\\nor when hope is gone.\"\\n\\nshe could not immediately have uttered another sentence; her heart\\nwas too full, her breath too much oppressed.\\n\\n\"you are a good soul,\" cried captain harville, putting his hand\\non her arm, quite affectionately.  \"there is no quarrelling with you.\\nand when i think of benwick, my tongue is tied.\"\\n\\ntheir attention was called towards the others.  mrs croft was taking leave.\\n\\n\"here, frederick, you and i part company, i believe,\" said she.\\n\"i am going home, and you have an engagement with your friend.\\nto-night we may have the pleasure of all meeting again at your party,\"\\n(turning to anne.)  \"we had your sister\\'s card yesterday,\\nand i understood frederick had a card too, though i did not see it;\\nand you are disengaged, frederick, are you not, as well as ourselves?\"\\n\\ncaptain wentworth was folding up a letter in great haste, and either\\ncould not or would not answer fully.\\n\\n\"yes,\" said he, \"very true; here we separate, but harville and i\\nshall soon be after you; that is, harville, if you are ready,\\ni am in half a minute.  i know you will not be sorry to be off.\\ni shall be at your service in half a minute.\"\\n\\nmrs croft left them, and captain wentworth, having sealed his letter\\nwith great rapidity, was indeed ready, and had even a hurried,\\nagitated air, which shewed impatience to be gone.  anne knew not how\\nto understand it.  she had the kindest \"good morning, god bless you!\"\\nfrom captain harville, but from him not a word, nor a look!\\nhe had passed out of the room without a look!\\n\\nshe had only time, however, to move closer to the table where\\nhe had been writing, when footsteps were heard returning;\\nthe door opened, it was himself.  he begged their pardon,\\nbut he had forgotten his gloves, and instantly crossing the room\\nto the writing table, he drew out a letter from under the scattered paper,\\nplaced it before anne with eyes of glowing entreaty fixed on her\\nfor a time, and hastily collecting his gloves, was again out of the room,\\nalmost before mrs musgrove was aware of his being in it:\\nthe work of an instant!\\n\\nthe revolution which one instant had made in anne, was almost\\nbeyond expression.  the letter, with a direction hardly legible,\\nto \"miss a. e.--,\" was evidently the one which he had been folding\\nso hastily.  while supposed to be writing only to captain benwick,\\nhe had been also addressing her!  on the contents of that letter\\ndepended all which this world could do for her.  anything was possible,\\nanything might be defied rather than suspense.  mrs musgrove had\\nlittle arrangements of her own at her own table; to their protection\\nshe must trust, and sinking into the chair which he had occupied,\\nsucceeding to the very spot where he had leaned and written,\\nher eyes devoured the following words:\\n\\n\\n\"i can listen no longer in silence.  i must speak to you by such means\\nas are within my reach.  you pierce my soul.  i am half agony,\\nhalf hope.  tell me not that i am too late, that such precious feelings\\nare gone for ever.  i offer myself to you again with a heart\\neven more your own than when you almost broke it, eight years\\nand a half ago.  dare not say that man forgets sooner than  woman,\\nthat his love has an earlier death.  i have loved none but you.\\nunjust i may have been, weak and resentful i have been,\\nbut never inconstant.  you alone have brought me to bath.\\nfor you alone, i think and plan.  have you not seen this?\\ncan you fail to have understood my wishes?  i had not waited even\\nthese ten days, could i have read your feelings, as i think you must have\\npenetrated mine.  i can hardly write.  i am every instant hearing\\nsomething which overpowers me.  you sink your voice, but i can\\ndistinguish the tones of that voice when they would be lost on others.\\ntoo good, too excellent creature!  you do us justice, indeed.\\nyou do believe that there is true attachment and constancy among men.\\nbelieve it to be most fervent, most undeviating, in f. w.\\n\\n\"i must go, uncertain of my fate; but i shall return hither,\\nor follow your party, as soon as possible.  a word, a look,\\nwill be enough to decide whether i enter your father\\'s house\\nthis evening or never.\"\\n\\n\\nsuch a letter was not to be soon recovered from.  half and hour\\'s solitude\\nand reflection might have tranquillized her; but the ten minutes only\\nwhich now passed before she was interrupted, with all the restraints\\nof her situation, could do nothing towards tranquillity.  every moment\\nrather brought fresh agitation.  it was overpowering happiness.\\nand before she was beyond the first stage of full sensation,\\ncharles, mary, and henrietta all came in.\\n\\nthe absolute necessity of seeming like herself produced then\\nan immediate struggle; but after a while she could do no more.\\nshe began not to understand a word they said, and was obliged\\nto plead indisposition and excuse herself.  they could then see\\nthat she looked very ill, were shocked and concerned, and would not\\nstir without her for the world.  this was dreadful.  would they only\\nhave gone away, and left her in the quiet possession of that room\\nit would have been her cure; but to have them all standing or\\nwaiting around her was distracting, and in desperation,\\nshe said she would go home.\\n\\n\"by all means, my dear,\" cried mrs musgrove, \"go home directly,\\nand take care of yourself, that you may be fit for the evening.\\ni wish sarah was here to doctor you, but i am no doctor myself.\\ncharles, ring and order a chair.  she must not walk.\"\\n\\nbut the chair would never do.  worse than all!  to lose the possibility\\nof speaking two words to captain wentworth in the course of her quiet,\\nsolitary progress up the town (and she felt almost certain of meeting him)\\ncould not be borne.  the chair was earnestly protested against,\\nand mrs musgrove, who thought only of one sort of illness,\\nhaving assured herself with some anxiety, that there had been no fall\\nin the case; that anne had not at any time lately slipped down,\\nand got a blow on her head; that she was perfectly convinced of having\\nhad no fall; could part with her cheerfully, and depend on\\nfinding her better at night.\\n\\nanxious to omit no possible precaution, anne struggled, and said--\\n\\n\"i am afraid, ma\\'am, that it is not perfectly understood.\\npray be so good as to mention to the other gentlemen that we hope\\nto see your whole party this evening.  i am afraid there had been\\nsome mistake; and i wish you particularly to assure captain harville\\nand captain wentworth, that we hope to see them both.\"\\n\\n\"oh! my dear, it is quite understood, i give you my word.\\ncaptain harville has no thought but of going.\"\\n\\n\"do you think so?  but i am afraid; and i should be so very sorry.\\nwill you promise me to mention it, when you see them again?\\nyou will see them both this morning, i dare say.  do promise me.\"\\n\\n\"to be sure i will, if you wish it.  charles, if you see captain harville\\nanywhere, remember to give miss anne\\'s message.  but indeed, my dear,\\nyou need not be uneasy.  captain harville holds himself quite engaged,\\ni\\'ll answer for it; and captain wentworth the same, i dare say.\"\\n\\nanne could do no more; but her heart prophesied some mischance\\nto damp the perfection of her felicity.  it could not be very lasting,\\nhowever.  even if he did not come to camden place himself,\\nit would be in her power to send an intelligible sentence\\nby captain harville.  another momentary vexation occurred.\\ncharles, in his real concern and good nature, would go home with her;\\nthere was no preventing him.  this was almost cruel.  but she could not\\nbe long ungrateful; he was sacrificing an engagement at a gunsmith\\'s,\\nto be of use to her; and she set off with him, with no feeling\\nbut gratitude apparent.\\n\\nthey were on union street, when a quicker step behind, a something\\nof familiar sound, gave her two moments\\' preparation for the sight\\nof captain wentworth.  he joined them; but, as if irresolute\\nwhether to join or to pass on, said nothing, only looked.\\nanne could command herself enough to receive that look,\\nand not repulsively.  the cheeks which had been pale now glowed,\\nand the movements which had hesitated were decided.  he walked by her side.\\npresently, struck by a sudden thought, charles said--\\n\\n\"captain wentworth, which way are you going?  only to gay street,\\nor farther up the town?\"\\n\\n\"i hardly know,\" replied captain wentworth, surprised.\\n\\n\"are you going as high as belmont?  are you going near camden place?\\nbecause, if you are, i shall have no scruple in asking you\\nto take my place, and give anne your arm to her father\\'s door.\\nshe is rather done for this morning, and must not go so far without help,\\nand i ought to be at that fellow\\'s in the market place.\\nhe promised me the sight of a capital gun he is just going to send off;\\nsaid he would keep it unpacked to the last possible moment,\\nthat i might see it; and if i do not turn back now, i have no chance.\\nby his description, a good deal like the second size double-barrel of mine,\\nwhich you shot with one day round winthrop.\"\\n\\nthere could not be an objection.  there could be only the most\\nproper alacrity, a most obliging compliance for public view;\\nand smiles reined in and spirits dancing in private rapture.\\nin half a minute charles was at the bottom of union street again,\\nand the other two proceeding together:  and soon words enough had passed\\nbetween them to decide their direction towards the comparatively quiet\\nand retired gravel walk, where the power of conversation would make\\nthe present hour a blessing indeed, and prepare it for all\\nthe immortality which the happiest recollections of their own future lives\\ncould bestow.  there they exchanged again those feelings\\nand those promises which had once before seemed to secure everything,\\nbut which had been followed by so many, many years of division\\nand estrangement.  there they returned again into the past,\\nmore exquisitely happy, perhaps, in their re-union, than when\\nit had been first projected; more tender, more tried, more fixed\\nin a knowledge of each other\\'s character, truth, and attachment;\\nmore equal to act, more justified in acting.  and there, as they slowly\\npaced the gradual ascent, heedless of every group around them,\\nseeing neither sauntering politicians, bustling housekeepers,\\nflirting girls, nor nursery-maids and children, they could indulge in\\nthose retrospections and acknowledgements, and especially in\\nthose explanations of what had directly preceded the present moment,\\nwhich were so poignant and so ceaseless in interest.  all the little\\nvariations of the last week were gone through; and of yesterday\\nand today there could scarcely be an end.\\n\\nshe had not mistaken him.  jealousy of mr elliot had been\\nthe retarding weight, the doubt, the torment.  that had begun to operate\\nin the very hour of first meeting her in bath; that had returned,\\nafter a short suspension, to ruin the concert; and that had influenced him\\nin everything he had said and done, or omitted to say and do,\\nin the last four-and-twenty hours.  it had been gradually yielding\\nto the better hopes which her looks, or words, or actions\\noccasionally encouraged; it had been vanquished at last by\\nthose sentiments and those tones which had reached him while she talked\\nwith captain harville; and under the irresistible governance of which\\nhe had seized a sheet of paper, and poured out his feelings.\\n\\nof what he had then written, nothing was to be retracted or qualified.\\nhe persisted in having loved none but her.  she had never been supplanted.\\nhe never even believed himself to see her equal.  thus much indeed\\nhe was obliged to acknowledge:  that he had been constant unconsciously,\\nnay unintentionally; that he had meant to forget her, and believed it\\nto be done.  he had imagined himself indifferent, when he had only\\nbeen angry; and he had been unjust to her merits, because he had been\\na sufferer from them.  her character was now fixed on his mind\\nas perfection itself, maintaining the loveliest medium of fortitude\\nand gentleness; but he was obliged to acknowledge that only at uppercross\\nhad he learnt to do her justice, and only at lyme had he begun\\nto understand himself.  at lyme, he had received lessons\\nof more than one sort.  the passing admiration of mr elliot\\nhad at least roused him, and the scenes on the cobb and at\\ncaptain harville\\'s had fixed her superiority.\\n\\nin his preceding attempts to attach himself to louisa musgrove\\n(the attempts of angry pride), he protested that he had for ever\\nfelt it to be impossible; that he had not cared, could not care,\\nfor louisa; though till that day, till the leisure for reflection\\nwhich followed it, he had not understood the perfect excellence\\nof the mind with which louisa\\'s could so ill bear a comparison,\\nor the perfect unrivalled hold it possessed over his own.\\nthere, he had learnt to distinguish between the steadiness of principle\\nand the obstinacy of self-will, between the darings of heedlessness\\nand the resolution of a collected mind.  there he had seen everything\\nto exalt in his estimation the woman he had lost; and there begun\\nto deplore the pride, the folly, the madness of resentment,\\nwhich had kept him from trying to regain her when thrown in his way.\\n\\nfrom that period his penance had become severe.  he had no sooner\\nbeen free from the horror and remorse attending the first few days\\nof louisa\\'s accident, no sooner begun to feel himself alive again,\\nthan he had begun to feel himself, though alive, not at liberty.\\n\\n\"i found,\" said he, \"that i was considered by harville an engaged man!\\nthat neither harville nor his wife entertained a doubt of our\\nmutual attachment.  i was startled and shocked.  to a degree,\\ni could contradict this instantly; but, when i began to reflect\\nthat others might have felt the same--her own family, nay,\\nperhaps herself--i was no longer at my own disposal.  i was hers in honour\\nif she wished it.  i had been unguarded.  i had not thought seriously\\non this subject before.  i had not considered that my excessive intimacy\\nmust have its danger of ill consequence in many ways; and that i had\\nno right to be trying whether i could attach myself to either of the girls,\\nat the risk of raising even an unpleasant report, were there no other\\nill effects.  i had been grossly wrong, and must abide the consequences.\"\\n\\nhe found too late, in short, that he had entangled himself;\\nand that precisely as he became fully satisfied of his not caring\\nfor louisa at all, he must regard himself as bound to her,\\nif her sentiments for him were what the harvilles supposed.\\nit determined him to leave lyme, and await her complete recovery elsewhere.\\nhe would gladly weaken, by any fair means, whatever feelings or\\nspeculations concerning him might exist; and he went, therefore,\\nto his brother\\'s, meaning after a while to return to kellynch,\\nand act as circumstances might require.\\n\\n\"i was six weeks with edward,\" said he, \"and saw him happy.\\ni could have no other pleasure.  i deserved none.  he enquired after you\\nvery particularly; asked even if you were personally altered,\\nlittle suspecting that to my eye you could never alter.\"\\n\\nanne smiled, and let it pass.  it was too pleasing a blunder\\nfor a reproach.  it is something for a woman to be assured,\\nin her eight-and-twentieth year, that she has not lost one charm\\nof earlier youth; but the value of such homage was inexpressibly increased\\nto anne, by comparing it with former words, and feeling it to be\\nthe result, not the cause of a revival of his warm attachment.\\n\\nhe had remained in shropshire, lamenting the blindness of his own pride,\\nand the blunders of his own calculations, till at once released from louisa\\nby the astonishing and felicitous intelligence of her engagement\\nwith benwick.\\n\\n\"here,\" said he, \"ended the worst of my state; for now i could at least\\nput myself in the way of happiness; i could exert myself;\\ni could do something.  but to be waiting so long in inaction,\\nand waiting only for evil, had been dreadful.  within the first\\nfive minutes i said, `i will be at bath on wednesday,\\' and i was.\\nwas it unpardonable to think it worth my while to come? and to arrive\\nwith some degree of hope?  you were single.  it was possible that\\nyou might retain the feelings of the past, as i did; and one encouragement\\nhappened to be mine.  i could never doubt that you would be loved and\\nsought by others, but i knew to a certainty that you had refused one man,\\nat least, of better pretensions than myself; and i could not help\\noften saying, `was this for me?\\'\"\\n\\ntheir first meeting in milsom street afforded much to be said,\\nbut the concert still more.  that evening seemed to be made up\\nof exquisite moments.  the moment of her stepping forward\\nin the octagon room to speak to him:  the moment of mr elliot\\'s appearing\\nand tearing her away, and one or two subsequent moments,\\nmarked by returning hope or increasing despondency, were dwelt on\\nwith energy.\\n\\n\"to see you,\" cried he, \"in the midst of those who could not be\\nmy well-wishers; to see your cousin close by you, conversing and smiling,\\nand feel all the horrible eligibilities and proprieties of the match!\\nto consider it as the certain wish of every being who could hope\\nto influence you!  even if your own feelings were reluctant or indifferent,\\nto consider what powerful supports would be his!  was it not enough\\nto make the fool of me which i appeared?  how could i look on\\nwithout agony?  was not the very sight of the friend who sat behind you,\\nwas not the recollection of what had been, the knowledge of her influence,\\nthe indelible, immoveable impression of what persuasion had once done--\\nwas it not all against me?\"\\n\\n\"you should have distinguished,\" replied anne.  \"you should not have\\nsuspected me now; the case is so different, and my age is so different.\\nif i was wrong in yielding to persuasion once, remember that\\nit was to persuasion exerted on the side of safety, not of risk.\\nwhen i yielded, i thought it was to duty, but no duty could be called\\nin aid here.  in marrying a man indifferent to me, all risk\\nwould have been incurred, and all duty violated.\"\\n\\n\"perhaps i ought to have reasoned thus,\" he replied, \"but i could not.\\ni could not derive benefit from the late knowledge i had acquired\\nof your character.  i could not bring it into play; it was overwhelmed,\\nburied, lost in those earlier feelings which i had been smarting under\\nyear after year.  i could think of you only as one who had yielded,\\nwho had given me up, who had been influenced by any one rather than by me.\\ni saw you with the very person who had guided you in that year of misery.\\ni had no reason to believe her of less authority now.  the force of habit\\nwas to be added.\"\\n\\n\"i should have thought,\" said anne, \"that my manner to yourself\\nmight have spared you much or all of this.\"\\n\\n\"no, no! your manner might be only the ease which your engagement\\nto another man would give.  i left you in this belief; and yet,\\ni was determined to see you again.  my spirits rallied with the morning,\\nand i felt that i had still a motive for remaining here.\"\\n\\nat last anne was at home again, and happier than any one in that house\\ncould have conceived.  all the surprise and suspense, and every other\\npainful part of the morning dissipated by this conversation,\\nshe re-entered the house so happy as to be obliged to find an alloy\\nin some momentary apprehensions of its being impossible to last.\\nan interval of meditation, serious and grateful, was the best corrective\\nof everything dangerous in such high-wrought felicity; and she went\\nto her room, and grew steadfast and fearless in the thankfulness\\nof her enjoyment.\\n\\nthe evening came, the drawing-rooms were lighted up, the company assembled.\\nit was but a card party, it was but a mixture of those who had\\nnever met before, and those who met too often; a commonplace business,\\ntoo numerous for intimacy, too small for variety; but anne had never found\\nan evening shorter.  glowing and lovely in sensibility and happiness,\\nand more generally admired than she thought about or cared for,\\nshe had cheerful or forbearing feelings for every creature around her.\\nmr elliot was there; she avoided, but she could pity him.\\nthe wallises, she had amusement in understanding them.  lady dalrymple\\nand miss carteret--they would soon be innoxious cousins to her.\\nshe cared not for mrs clay, and had nothing to blush for in\\nthe public manners of her father and sister.  with the musgroves,\\nthere was the happy chat of perfect ease; with captain harville,\\nthe kind-hearted intercourse of brother and sister; with lady russell,\\nattempts at conversation, which a delicious consciousness cut short;\\nwith admiral and mrs croft, everything of peculiar cordiality and\\nfervent interest, which the same consciousness sought to conceal;\\nand with captain wentworth, some moments of communications\\ncontinually occurring, and always the hope of more, and always\\nthe knowledge of his being there.\\n\\nit was in one of these short meetings, each apparently occupied\\nin admiring a fine display of greenhouse plants, that she said--\\n\\n\"i have been thinking over the past, and trying impartially\\nto judge of the right and wrong, i mean with regard to myself;\\nand i must believe that i was right, much as i suffered from it,\\nthat i was perfectly right in being guided by the friend whom\\nyou will love better than you do now.  to me, she was in the place\\nof a parent.  do not mistake me, however.  i am not saying\\nthat she did not err in her advice.  it was, perhaps, one of those cases\\nin which advice is good or bad only as the event decides;\\nand for myself, i certainly never should, in any circumstance\\nof tolerable similarity, give such advice.  but i mean, that i was right\\nin submitting to her, and that if i had done otherwise, i should have\\nsuffered more in continuing the engagement than i did even in giving it up,\\nbecause i should have suffered in my conscience.  i have now,\\nas far as such a sentiment is allowable in human nature, nothing\\nto reproach myself with; and if i mistake not, a strong sense of duty\\nis no bad part of a woman\\'s portion.\"\\n\\nhe looked at her, looked at lady russell, and looking again at her,\\nreplied, as if in cool deliberation--\\n\\n\"not yet.  but there are hopes of her being forgiven in time.\\ni trust to being in charity with her soon.  but i too have been\\nthinking over the past, and a  question has suggested itself,\\nwhether there may not have been one person more my enemy\\neven than that lady?  my own self.  tell me if, when i returned\\nto england in the year eight, with a few thousand pounds,\\nand was posted into the laconia, if i had then written to you,\\nwould you have answered my letter?  would you, in short,\\nhave renewed the engagement then?\"\\n\\n\"would i!\" was all her answer; but the accent was decisive enough.\\n\\n\"good god!\" he cried, \"you would!  it is not that i did not think of it,\\nor desire it, as what could alone crown all my other success;\\nbut i was proud, too proud to ask again.  i did not understand you.\\ni shut my eyes, and would not understand you, or do you justice.\\nthis is a recollection which ought to make me forgive every one\\nsooner than myself.  six years of separation and suffering\\nmight have been spared.  it is a sort of pain, too, which is new to me.\\ni have been used to the gratification of believing myself to earn\\nevery blessing that i enjoyed.  i have valued myself on honourable toils\\nand just rewards.  like other great men under reverses,\" he added,\\nwith a smile. \"i must endeavour to subdue my mind to my fortune.\\ni must learn to brook being happier than i deserve.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 24\\n\\n\\nwho can be in doubt of what followed?  when any two young people\\ntake it into their heads to marry, they are pretty sure by perseverance\\nto carry their point, be they ever so poor, or ever so imprudent,\\nor ever so little likely to be necessary to each other\\'s ultimate comfort.\\nthis may be bad morality to conclude with, but i believe it to be truth;\\nand if such parties succeed, how should a captain wentworth and\\nan anne elliot, with the advantage of maturity of mind,\\nconsciousness of right, and one independent fortune between them,\\nfail of bearing down every opposition?  they might in fact,\\nhave borne down a great deal more than they met with, for there was\\nlittle to distress them beyond the want of graciousness and warmth.\\nsir walter made no objection, and elizabeth did nothing worse\\nthan look cold and unconcerned.  captain wentworth, with five-and-twenty\\nthousand pounds, and as high in his profession as merit and activity\\ncould place him, was no longer nobody.  he was now esteemed quite worthy\\nto address the daughter of a foolish, spendthrift baronet,\\nwho had not had principle or sense enough to maintain himself\\nin the situation in which providence had placed him, and who could\\ngive his daughter at present but a small part of the share\\nof ten thousand pounds which must be hers hereafter.\\n\\nsir walter, indeed, though he had no affection for anne,\\nand no vanity flattered, to make him really happy on the occasion,\\nwas very far from thinking it a bad match for her.  on the contrary,\\nwhen he saw more of captain wentworth, saw him repeatedly by daylight,\\nand eyed him well, he was very much struck by his personal claims,\\nand felt that his superiority of appearance might be not unfairly balanced\\nagainst her superiority of rank; and all this, assisted by\\nhis well-sounding name, enabled sir walter at last to prepare his pen,\\nwith a very good grace, for the insertion of the marriage\\nin the volume of honour.\\n\\nthe only one among them, whose opposition of feeling could excite\\nany serious anxiety was lady russell.  anne knew that lady russell\\nmust be suffering some pain in understanding and relinquishing mr elliot,\\nand be making some struggles to become truly acquainted with,\\nand do justice to captain wentworth.  this however was what\\nlady russell had now to do.  she must learn to feel that she had\\nbeen mistaken with regard to both; that she had been unfairly influenced\\nby appearances in each; that because captain wentworth\\'s manners\\nhad not suited her own ideas, she had been too quick in suspecting them\\nto indicate a character of dangerous impetuosity; and that because\\nmr elliot\\'s manners had precisely pleased her in their propriety\\nand correctness, their general politeness and suavity, she had been\\ntoo quick in receiving them as the certain result of the most correct\\nopinions and well-regulated mind.  there was nothing less\\nfor lady russell to do, than to admit that she had been\\npretty completely wrong, and to take up a new set of opinions\\nand of hopes.\\n\\nthere is a quickness of perception in some, a nicety in the discernment\\nof character, a natural penetration, in short, which no experience\\nin others can equal, and lady russell had been less gifted\\nin this part of understanding than her young friend.  but she was\\na very good woman, and if her second object was to be sensible\\nand well-judging, her first was to see anne happy.  she loved anne\\nbetter than she loved her own abilities; and when the awkwardness\\nof the beginning was over, found little hardship in attaching herself\\nas a mother to the man who was securing the happiness of her other child.\\n\\nof all the family, mary was probably the one most immediately gratified\\nby the circumstance.  it was creditable to have a sister married,\\nand she might flatter herself with having been greatly instrumental\\nto the connexion, by keeping anne with her in the autumn;\\nand as her own sister must be better than her husband\\'s sisters,\\nit was very agreeable that captain wentworth should be a richer man than\\neither captain benwick or charles hayter.  she had something to suffer,\\nperhaps, when they came into contact again, in seeing anne restored\\nto the rights of seniority, and the mistress of a very pretty landaulette;\\nbut she had a future to look forward to, of powerful consolation.\\nanne had no uppercross hall before her, no landed estate,\\nno headship of a family; and if they could but keep captain wentworth\\nfrom being made a baronet, she would not change situations with anne.\\n\\nit would be well for the eldest sister if she were equally satisfied\\nwith her situation, for a change is not very probable there.\\nshe had soon the mortification of seeing mr elliot withdraw,\\nand no one of proper condition has since presented himself to raise\\neven the unfounded hopes which sunk with him.\\n\\nthe news of his cousins anne\\'s engagement burst on mr elliot\\nmost unexpectedly.  it deranged his best plan of domestic happiness,\\nhis best hope of keeping sir walter single by the watchfulness\\nwhich a son-in-law\\'s rights would have given.  but, though discomfited\\nand disappointed, he could still do something for his own interest\\nand his own enjoyment.  he soon quitted bath; and on mrs clay\\'s\\nquitting it soon afterwards, and being next heard of as established\\nunder his protection in london, it was evident how double a game\\nhe had been playing, and how determined he was to save himself\\nfrom being cut out by one artful woman, at least.\\n\\nmrs clay\\'s affections had overpowered her interest, and she had sacrificed,\\nfor the young man\\'s sake, the possibility of scheming longer\\nfor sir walter.  she has abilities, however, as well as affections;\\nand it is now a doubtful point whether his cunning, or hers,\\nmay finally carry the day; whether, after preventing her from being\\nthe wife of sir walter, he may not be wheedled and caressed at last\\ninto making her the wife of sir william.\\n\\nit cannot be doubted that sir walter and elizabeth were shocked\\nand mortified by the loss of their companion, and the discovery of\\ntheir deception in her.  they had their great cousins, to be sure,\\nto resort to for comfort; but they must long feel that to flatter\\nand follow others, without being flattered and followed in turn,\\nis but a state of half enjoyment.\\n\\nanne, satisfied at a very early period of lady russell\\'s meaning\\nto love captain wentworth as she ought, had no other alloy\\nto the happiness of her prospects than what arose from the consciousness\\nof having no relations to bestow on him which a man of sense could value.\\nthere she felt her own inferiority very keenly.  the disproportion\\nin their fortune was nothing; it did not give her a moment\\'s regret;\\nbut to have no family to receive and estimate him properly,\\nnothing of respectability, of harmony, of good will to offer\\nin return for all the worth and all the prompt welcome which met her\\nin his brothers and sisters, was a source of as lively pain\\nas her mind could well be sensible of under circumstances of otherwise\\nstrong felicity.  she had but two friends in the world to add to his list,\\nlady russell and mrs smith.  to those, however, he was very well disposed\\nto attach himself.  lady russell, in spite of all her former transgressions,\\nhe could now value from his heart.  while he was not obliged to say\\nthat he believed her to have been right in originally dividing them,\\nhe was ready to say almost everything else in her favour,\\nand as for mrs smith, she had claims of various kinds to recommend her\\nquickly and permanently.\\n\\nher recent good offices by anne had been enough in themselves,\\nand their marriage, instead of depriving her of one friend,\\nsecured her two.  she was their earliest visitor in their settled life;\\nand captain wentworth, by putting her in the way of recovering\\nher husband\\'s property in the west indies, by writing for her,\\nacting for her, and seeing her through all the petty difficulties\\nof the case with the activity and exertion of a fearless man\\nand a determined friend, fully requited the services which\\nshe had rendered, or ever meant to render, to his wife.\\n\\nmrs smith\\'s enjoyments were not spoiled by this improvement of income,\\nwith some improvement of health, and the acquisition of such friends\\nto be often with, for her cheerfulness and mental alacrity did not\\nfail her; and while these prime supplies of good remained, she might have\\nbid defiance even to greater accessions of worldly prosperity.\\nshe might have been absolutely rich and perfectly healthy,\\nand yet be happy.  her spring of felicity was in the glow\\nof her spirits, as her friend anne\\'s was in the warmth of her heart.\\nanne was tenderness itself, and she had the full worth of it\\nin captain wentworth\\'s affection.  his profession was all that could ever\\nmake her friends wish that tenderness less, the dread of a future war\\nall that could dim her sunshine.  she gloried in being a sailor\\'s wife,\\nbut she must pay the tax of quick alarm for belonging to that profession\\nwhich is, if possible, more distinguished in its domestic virtues\\nthan in its national importance.\\n\\n\\n\\n        finis\\n\\n\\n\\n'"

seriously to think what could be done\\nand had finally proposed these two branches of economy to cut off\\nsome unnecessary charities and to refrain from new furnishing\\nthe drawingroom to which expedients she afterwards added\\nthe happy thought of their taking no present down to Anne\\nas had been the usual yearly custom  But these measures\\nhowever good in themselves were insufficient for the real extent\\nof the evil the whole of which Sir Walter found himself obliged\\nto confess to her soon afterwards  Elizabeth had nothing to propose\\nof deeper efficacy  She felt herself illused and unfortunate\\nas did her father and they were neither of them able to devise\\nany means of lessening their expenses without compromising their dignity\\nor relinquishing their comforts in a way not to be borne\\n\\nThere was only a small part of his estate that Sir Walter could dispose of\\nbut had every acre been alienable it would have made no difference\\nHe had condescended to mortgage as far as he had the power\\nbut he would never condescend to sell  No he would never disgrace\\nhis name so far  The Kellynch estate should be transmitted whole\\nand entire as he had received it\\n\\nTheir two confidential friends Mr Shepherd who lived in\\nthe neighbouring market town and Lady Russell were called to advise them\\nand both father and daughter seemed to expect that something should be\\nstruck out by one or the other to remove their embarrassments\\nand reduce their expenditure without involving the loss of\\nany indulgence of taste or pride\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 2\\n\\n\\nMr Shepherd a civil cautious lawyer who whatever might be his hold\\nor his views on Sir Walter would rather have the disagreeable\\nprompted by anybody else excused himself from offering the slightest hint\\nand only begged leave to recommend an implicit reference to\\nthe excellent judgement of Lady Russell from whose known good sense\\nhe fully expected to have just such resolute measures advised as\\nhe meant to see finally adopted\\n\\nLady Russell was most anxiously zealous on the subject and gave it\\nmuch serious consideration  She was a woman rather of sound than of\\nquick abilities whose difficulties in coming to any decision\\nin this instance were great from the opposition of two leading principles\\nShe was of strict integrity herself with a delicate sense of honour\\nbut she was as desirous of saving Sir Walters feelings as solicitous\\nfor the credit of the family as aristocratic in her ideas of what\\nwas due to them as anybody of sense and honesty could well be\\nShe was a benevolent charitable good woman and capable of\\nstrong attachments most correct in her conduct strict in her notions\\nof decorum and with manners that were held a standard of goodbreeding\\nShe had a cultivated mind and was generally speaking\\nrational and consistent but she had prejudices on the side of ancestry\\nshe had a value for rank and consequence which blinded her a little\\nto the faults of those who possessed them  Herself the widow of\\nonly a knight she gave the dignity of a baronet all its due\\nand Sir Walter independent of his claims as an old acquaintance\\nan attentive neighbour an obliging landlord the husband of her\\nvery dear friend the father of Anne and her sisters was\\nas being Sir Walter in her apprehension entitled to a great deal\\nof compassion and consideration under his present difficulties\\n\\nThey must retrench that did not admit of a doubt  But she was\\nvery anxious to have it done with the least possible pain to him\\nand Elizabeth She drew up plans of economy she made exact calculations\\nand she did what nobody else thought of doing  she consulted Anne\\nwho never seemed considered by the others as having any interest\\nin the question She consulted and in a degree was influenced by her\\nin marking out the scheme of retrenchment which was at last submitted\\nto Sir Walter Every emendation of Annes had been on the side of\\nhonesty against importance  She wanted more vigorous measures\\na more complete reformation a quicker release from debt\\na much higher tone of indifference for everything but justice and equity\\n\\nIf we can persuade your father to all this said Lady Russell\\nlooking over her paper much may be done  If he will adopt\\nthese regulations in seven years he will be clear and I hope\\nwe may be able to convince him and Elizabeth that Kellynch Hall has\\na respectability in itself which cannot be affected by these reductions\\nand that the true dignity of Sir Walter Elliot will be very far from\\nlessened in the eyes of sensible people by acting like a man of principle\\nWhat will he be doing in fact but what very many of our first families\\nhave done or ought to do  There will be nothing singular in his case\\nand it is singularity which often makes the worst part of our suffering\\nas it always does of our conduct  I have great hope of prevailing\\nWe must be serious and decided for after all the person who\\nhas contracted debts must pay them and though a great deal is due to\\nthe feelings of the gentleman and the head of a house like your father\\nthere is still more due to the character of an honest man\\n\\nThis was the principle on which Anne wanted her father to be proceeding\\nhis friends to be urging him  She considered it as an act\\nof indispensable duty to clear away the claims of creditors with\\nall the expedition which the most comprehensive retrenchments\\ncould secure and saw no dignity in anything short of it\\nShe wanted it to be prescribed and felt as a duty  She rated\\nLady Russells influence highly and as to the severe degree\\nof selfdenial which her own conscience prompted she believed\\nthere might be little more difficulty in persuading them to a complete\\nthan to half a reformation  Her knowledge of her father\\nand Elizabeth inclined her to think that the sacrifice of one pair\\nof horses would be hardly less painful than of both and so on\\nthrough the whole list of Lady Russells too gentle reductions\\n\\nHow Annes more rigid requisitions might have been taken\\nis of little consequence  Lady Russells had no success at all\\ncould not be put up with were not to be borne What every comfort\\nof life knocked off  Journeys London servants horses table\\ncontractions and restrictions every where  To live no longer\\nwith the decencies even of a private gentleman  No he would sooner\\nquit Kellynch Hall at once than remain in it on such disgraceful terms\\n\\nQuit Kellynch Hall  The hint was immediately taken up by Mr Shepherd\\nwhose interest was involved in the reality of Sir Walters retrenching\\nand who was perfectly persuaded that nothing would be done without\\na change of abode  Since the idea had been started in the very quarter\\nwhich ought to dictate he had no scruple he said in confessing\\nhis judgement to be entirely on that side  It did not appear to him\\nthat Sir Walter could materially alter his style of living in a house\\nwhich had such a character of hospitality and ancient dignity to support\\nIn any other place Sir Walter might judge for himself and would\\nbe looked up to as regulating the modes of life in whatever way\\nhe might choose to model his household\\n\\nSir Walter would quit Kellynch Hall and after a very few days more\\nof doubt and indecision the great question of whither he should go\\nwas settled and the first outline of this important change made out\\n\\nThere had been three alternatives London Bath or another house\\nin the country  All Annes wishes had been for the latter\\nA small house in their own neighbourhood where they might still have\\nLady Russells society still be near Mary and still have the pleasure\\nof sometimes seeing the lawns and groves of Kellynch was the object\\nof her ambition  But the usual fate of Anne attended her\\nin having something very opposite from her inclination fixed on\\nShe disliked Bath and did not think it agreed with her\\nand Bath was to be her home\\n\\nSir Walter had at first thought more of London but Mr Shepherd felt\\nthat he could not be trusted in London and had been skilful enough\\nto dissuade him from it and make Bath preferred  It was a much safer\\nplace for a gentleman in his predicament  he might there be important\\nat comparatively little expense  Two material advantages of Bath\\nover London had of course been given all their weight  its more convenient\\ndistance from Kellynch only fifty miles and Lady Russells spending\\nsome part of every winter there and to the very great satisfaction\\nof Lady Russell whose first views on the projected change had been\\nfor Bath Sir Walter and Elizabeth were induced to believe that\\nthey should lose neither consequence nor enjoyment by settling there\\n\\nLady Russell felt obliged to oppose her dear Annes known wishes\\nIt would be too much to expect Sir Walter to descend into a small house\\nin his own neighbourhood  Anne herself would have found\\nthe mortifications of it more than she foresaw and to Sir Walters\\nfeelings they must have been dreadful  And with regard to Annes\\ndislike of Bath she considered it as a prejudice and mistake arising\\nfirst from the circumstance of her having been three years\\nat school there after her mothers death and secondly\\nfrom her happening to be not in perfectly good spirits the only winter\\nwhich she had afterwards spent there with herself\\n\\nLady Russell was fond of Bath in short and disposed to think\\nit must suit them all and as to her young friends health\\nby passing all the warm months with her at Kellynch Lodge\\nevery danger would be avoided and it was in fact a change which must\\ndo both health and spirits good  Anne had been too little from home\\ntoo little seen Her spirits were not high  A larger society\\nwould improve them  She wanted her to be more known\\n\\nThe undesirableness of any other house in the same neighbourhood\\nfor Sir Walter was certainly much strengthened by one part\\nand a very material part of the scheme which had been happily\\nengrafted on the beginning  He was not only to quit his home\\nbut to see it in the hands of others a trial of fortitude\\nwhich stronger heads than Sir Walters have found too much\\nKellynch Hall was to be let  This however was a profound secret\\nnot to be breathed beyond their own circle\\n\\nSir Walter could not have borne the degradation of being known\\nto design letting his house  Mr Shepherd had once mentioned the word\\nadvertise but never dared approach it again  Sir Walter spurned\\nthe idea of its being offered in any manner forbad the slightest hint\\nbeing dropped of his having such an intention and it was only on\\nthe supposition of his being spontaneously solicited by some most\\nunexceptionable applicant on his own terms and as a great favour\\nthat he would let it at all\\n\\nHow quick come the reasons for approving what we like  Lady Russell had\\nanother excellent one at hand for being extremely glad that Sir Walter\\nand his family were to remove from the country  Elizabeth had been\\nlately forming an intimacy which she wished to see interrupted\\nIt was with the daughter of Mr Shepherd who had returned\\nafter an unprosperous marriage to her fathers house with\\nthe additional burden of two children  She was a clever young woman\\nwho understood the art of pleasingthe art of pleasing at least\\nat Kellynch Hall and who had made herself so acceptable to Miss Elliot\\nas to have been already staying there more than once in spite of all\\nthat Lady Russell who thought it a friendship quite out of place\\ncould hint of caution and reserve\\n\\nLady Russell indeed had scarcely any influence with Elizabeth\\nand seemed to love her rather because she would love her\\nthan because Elizabeth deserved it  She had never received from her more\\nthan outward attention nothing beyond the observances of complaisance\\nhad never succeeded in any point which she wanted to carry\\nagainst previous inclination  She had been repeatedly very earnest\\nin trying to get Anne included in the visit to London sensibly open\\nto all the injustice and all the discredit of the selfish arrangements\\nwhich shut her out and on many lesser occasions had endeavoured\\nto give Elizabeth the advantage of her own better judgement and experience\\nbut always in vain  Elizabeth would go her own way and never had she\\npursued it in more decided opposition to Lady Russell than in\\nthis selection of Mrs Clay turning from the society of so deserving\\na sister to bestow her affection and confidence on one who ought\\nto have been nothing to her but the object of distant civility\\n\\nFrom situation Mrs Clay was in Lady Russells estimate a very unequal\\nand in her character she believed a very dangerous companion\\nand a removal that would leave Mrs Clay behind and bring a choice\\nof more suitable intimates within Miss Elliots reach was therefore\\nan object of firstrate importance\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 3\\n\\n\\nI must take leave to observe Sir Walter said Mr Shepherd\\none morning at Kellynch Hall as he laid down the newspaper\\nthat the present juncture is much in our favour  This peace will\\nbe turning all our rich naval officers ashore  They will be\\nall wanting a home  Could not be a better time Sir Walter\\nfor having a choice of tenants very responsible tenants\\nMany a noble fortune has been made during the war  If a rich admiral\\nwere to come in our way Sir Walter\\n\\nHe would be a very lucky man Shepherd replied Sir Walter\\nthats all I have to remark  A prize indeed would Kellynch Hall\\nbe to him rather the greatest prize of all let him have taken\\never so many before hey Shepherd\\n\\nMr Shepherd laughed as he knew he must at this wit and then added\\n\\nI presume to observe Sir Walter that in the way of business\\ngentlemen of the navy are well to deal with  I have had a little knowledge\\nof their methods of doing business and I am free to confess that they\\nhave very liberal notions and are as likely to make desirable tenants\\nas any set of people one should meet with  Therefore Sir Walter\\nwhat I would take leave to suggest is that if in consequence of\\nany rumours getting abroad of your intention which must be contemplated\\nas a possible thing because we know how difficult it is to keep\\nthe actions and designs of one part of the world from the notice\\nand curiosity of the other consequence has its tax I John Shepherd\\nmight conceal any familymatters that I chose for nobody would think it\\nworth their while to observe me but Sir Walter Elliot has eyes upon him\\nwhich it may be very difficult to elude and therefore thus much\\nI venture upon that it will not greatly surprise me if\\nwith all our caution some rumour of the truth should get abroad\\nin the supposition of which as I was going to observe since applications\\nwill unquestionably follow I should think any from our wealthy\\nnaval commanders particularly worth attending to and beg leave to add\\nthat two hours will bring me over at any time to save you\\nthe trouble of replying\\n\\nSir Walter only nodded  But soon afterwards rising and pacing the room\\nhe observed sarcastically\\n\\nThere are few among the gentlemen of the navy I imagine who would\\nnot be surprised to find themselves in a house of this description\\n\\nThey would look around them no doubt and bless their good fortune\\nsaid Mrs Clay for Mrs Clay was present  her father had driven her over\\nnothing being of so much use to Mrs Clays health as a drive to Kellynch\\nbut I quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might be\\na very desirable tenant  I have known a good deal of the profession\\nand besides their liberality they are so neat and careful\\nin all their ways  These valuable pictures of yours Sir Walter\\nif you chose to leave them would be perfectly safe  Everything in\\nand about the house would be taken such excellent care of\\nThe gardens and shrubberies would be kept in almost as high order\\nas they are now  You need not be afraid Miss Elliot of your own\\nsweet flower gardens being neglected\\n\\nAs to all that rejoined Sir Walter coolly supposing I were induced\\nto let my house I have by no means made up my mind as to the privileges\\nto be annexed to it  I am not particularly disposed to favour a tenant\\nThe park would be open to him of course and few navy officers\\nor men of any other description can have had such a range\\nbut what restrictions I might impose on the use of the pleasuregrounds\\nis another thing  I am not fond of the idea of my shrubberies being\\nalways approachable and I should recommend Miss Elliot to be on her guard\\nwith respect to her flower garden  I am very little disposed\\nto grant a tenant of Kellynch Hall any extraordinary favour\\nI assure you be he sailor or soldier\\n\\nAfter a short pause Mr Shepherd presumed to say\\n\\nIn all these cases there are established usages which\\nmake everything plain and easy between landlord and tenant\\nYour interest Sir Walter is in pretty safe hands  Depend upon me\\nfor taking care that no tenant has more than his just rights\\nI venture to hint that Sir Walter Elliot cannot be half so jealous\\nfor his own as John Shepherd will be for him\\n\\nHere Anne spoke\\n\\nThe navy I think who have done so much for us have at least\\nan equal claim with any other set of men for all the comforts and\\nall the privileges which any home can give  Sailors work hard enough\\nfor their comforts we must all allow\\n\\nVery true very true  What Miss Anne says is very true\\nwas Mr Shepherds rejoinder and Oh certainly was his daughters\\nbut Sir Walters remark was soon afterwards\\n\\nThe profession has its utility but I should be sorry to see\\nany friend of mine belonging to it\\n\\nIndeed was the reply and with a look of surprise\\n\\nYes it is in two points offensive to me I have two strong grounds\\nof objection to it  First as being the means of bringing persons\\nof obscure birth into undue distinction and raising men to honours\\nwhich their fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of and secondly\\nas it cuts up a mans youth and vigour most horribly a sailor grows old\\nsooner than any other man  I have observed it all my life\\nA man is in greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise\\nof one whose father his father might have disdained to speak to\\nand of becoming prematurely an object of disgust himself than in\\nany other line  One day last spring in town I was in company\\nwith two men striking instances of what I am talking of\\nLord St Ives whose father we all know to have been a country curate\\nwithout bread to eat I was to give place to Lord St Ives\\nand a certain Admiral Baldwin the most deplorablelooking personage\\nyou can imagine his face the colour of mahogany rough and rugged\\nto the last degree all lines and wrinkles nine grey hairs of a side\\nand nothing but a dab of powder at top  In the name of heaven\\nwho is that old fellow said I to a friend of mine who was standing near\\nSir Basil Morley  Old fellow cried Sir Basil it is Admiral Baldwin\\nWhat do you take his age to be  Sixty said I or perhaps sixtytwo\\nForty replied Sir Basil forty and no more  Picture to yourselves\\nmy amazement I shall not easily forget Admiral Baldwin\\nI never saw quite so wretched an example of what a seafaring life can do\\nbut to a degree I know it is the same with them all  they are all\\nknocked about and exposed to every climate and every weather\\ntill they are not fit to be seen  It is a pity they are not knocked\\non the head at once before they reach Admiral Baldwins age\\n\\nNay Sir Walter cried Mrs Clay this is being severe indeed\\nHave a little mercy on the poor men  We are not all born to be handsome\\nThe sea is no beautifier certainly sailors do grow old betimes\\nI have observed it they soon lose the look of youth  But then\\nis not it the same with many other professions perhaps most other\\nSoldiers in active service are not at all better off  and even in\\nthe quieter professions there is a toil and a labour of the mind\\nif not of the body which seldom leaves a mans looks to the natural\\neffect of time  The lawyer plods quite careworn the physician\\nis up at all hours and travelling in all weather and even\\nthe clergyman she stopt a moment to consider what might\\ndo for the clergymanand even the clergyman you know is obliged\\nto go into infected rooms and expose his health and looks to\\nall the injury of a poisonous atmosphere  In fact as I have\\nlong been convinced though every profession is necessary and honourable\\nin its turn it is only the lot of those who are not obliged to follow any\\nwho can live in a regular way in the country choosing their own hours\\nfollowing their own pursuits and living on their own property\\nwithout the torment of trying for more it is only their lot I say\\nto hold the blessings of health and a good appearance to the utmost\\nI know no other set of men but what lose something of their personableness\\nwhen they cease to be quite young\\n\\nIt seemed as if Mr Shepherd in this anxiety to bespeak\\nSir Walters good will towards a naval officer as tenant\\nhad been gifted with foresight for the very first application\\nfor the house was from an Admiral Croft with whom he shortly afterwards\\nfell into company in attending the quarter sessions at Taunton and indeed\\nhe had received a hint of the Admiral from a London correspondent\\nBy the report which he hastened over to Kellynch to make\\nAdmiral Croft was a native of Somersetshire who having acquired\\na very handsome fortune was wishing to settle in his own country\\nand had come down to Taunton in order to look at some advertised places\\nin that immediate neighbourhood which however had not suited him\\nthat accidentally hearingit was just as he had foretold\\nMr Shepherd observed Sir Walters concerns could not be kept a secret\\naccidentally hearing of the possibility of Kellynch Hall being to let\\nand understanding his Mr Shepherds connection with the owner\\nhe had introduced himself to him in order to make particular inquiries\\nand had in the course of a pretty long conference expressed as strong\\nan inclination for the place as a man who knew it only by description\\ncould feel and given Mr Shepherd in his explicit account of himself\\nevery proof of his being a most responsible eligible tenant\\n\\nAnd who is Admiral Croft was Sir Walters cold suspicious inquiry\\n\\nMr Shepherd answered for his being of a gentlemans family\\nand mentioned a place and Anne after the little pause which followed\\nadded\\n\\nHe is a rear admiral of the white  He was in the Trafalgar action\\nand has been in the East Indies since he was stationed there\\nI believe several years\\n\\nThen I take it for granted observed Sir Walter that his face\\nis about as orange as the cuffs and capes of my livery\\n\\nMr Shepherd hastened to assure him that Admiral Croft was a very hale\\nhearty welllooking man a little weatherbeaten to be sure\\nbut not much and quite the gentleman in all his notions and behaviour\\nnot likely to make the smallest difficulty about terms only wanted\\na comfortable home and to get into it as soon as possible\\nknew he must pay for his convenience knew what rent a readyfurnished\\nhouse of that consequence might fetch should not have been surprised\\nif Sir Walter had asked more had inquired about the manor\\nwould be glad of the deputation certainly but made no great point of it\\nsaid he sometimes took out a gun but never killed quite the gentleman\\n\\nMr Shepherd was eloquent on the subject pointing out all\\nthe circumstances of the Admirals family which made him\\npeculiarly desirable as a tenant  He was a married man\\nand without children the very state to be wished for  A house was\\nnever taken good care of Mr Shepherd observed without a lady\\nhe did not know whether furniture might not be in danger of suffering\\nas much where there was no lady as where there were many children\\nA lady without a family was the very best preserver of furniture\\nin the world  He had seen Mrs Croft too she was at Taunton\\nwith the admiral and had been present almost all the time they were\\ntalking the matter over\\n\\nAnd a very wellspoken genteel shrewd lady she seemed to be\\ncontinued he asked more questions about the house and terms\\nand taxes than the Admiral himself and seemed more conversant\\nwith business and moreover Sir Walter I found she was not quite\\nunconnected in this country any more than her husband that is to say\\nshe is sister to a gentleman who did live amongst us once\\nshe told me so herself  sister to the gentleman who lived\\na few years back at Monkford  Bless me what was his name\\nAt this moment I cannot recollect his name though I have heard it so lately\\nPenelope my dear can you help me to the name of the gentleman\\nwho lived at Monkford  Mrs Crofts brother\\n\\nBut Mrs Clay was talking so eagerly with Miss Elliot that she did not\\nhear the appeal\\n\\nI have no conception whom you can mean Shepherd I remember\\nno gentleman resident at Monkford since the time of old Governor Trent\\n\\nBless me how very odd  I shall forget my own name soon I suppose\\nA name that I am so very well acquainted with knew the gentleman\\nso well by sight seen him a hundred times came to consult me once\\nI remember about a trespass of one of his neighbours farmers man\\nbreaking into his orchard wall torn down apples stolen\\ncaught in the fact and afterwards contrary to my judgement\\nsubmitted to an amicable compromise  Very odd indeed\\n\\nAfter waiting another moment\\n\\nYou mean Mr Wentworth I suppose said Anne\\n\\nMr Shepherd was all gratitude\\n\\nWentworth was the very name  Mr Wentworth was the very man\\nHe had the curacy of Monkford you know Sir Walter some time back\\nfor two or three years  Came there about the year 5 I take it\\nYou remember him I am sure\\n\\nWentworth  Oh ayMr Wentworth the curate of Monkford\\nYou misled me by the term gentleman  I thought you were speaking of\\nsome man of property  Mr Wentworth was nobody I remember\\nquite unconnected nothing to do with the Strafford family\\nOne wonders how the names of many of our nobility become so common\\n\\nAs Mr Shepherd perceived that this connexion of the Crofts did them\\nno service with Sir Walter he mentioned it no more returning\\nwith all his zeal to dwell on the circumstances more indisputably\\nin their favour their age and number and fortune the high idea\\nthey had formed of Kellynch Hall and extreme solicitude for\\nthe advantage of renting it making it appear as if they ranked\\nnothing beyond the happiness of being the tenants of Sir Walter Elliot\\nan extraordinary taste certainly could they have been supposed in\\nthe secret of Sir Walters estimate of the dues of a tenant\\n\\nIt succeeded however and though Sir Walter must ever look with\\nan evil eye on anyone intending to inhabit that house and think them\\ninfinitely too well off in being permitted to rent it on the highest terms\\nhe was talked into allowing Mr Shepherd to proceed in the treaty\\nand authorising him to wait on Admiral Croft who still remained\\nat Taunton and fix a day for the house being seen\\n\\nSir Walter was not very wise but still he had experience enough\\nof the world to feel that a more unobjectionable tenant\\nin all essentials than Admiral Croft bid fair to be could hardly offer\\nSo far went his understanding and his vanity supplied a little\\nadditional soothing in the Admirals situation in life which was just\\nhigh enough and not too high  I have let my house to Admiral Croft\\nwould sound extremely well very much better than to any mere Mr\\na Mr save perhaps some half dozen in the nation always needs\\na note of explanation  An admiral speaks his own consequence\\nand at the same time can never make a baronet look small\\nIn all their dealings and intercourse Sir Walter Elliot must ever\\nhave the precedence\\n\\nNothing could be done without a reference to Elizabeth\\nbut her inclination was growing so strong for a removal\\nthat she was happy to have it fixed and expedited by a tenant at hand\\nand not a word to suspend decision was uttered by her\\n\\nMr Shepherd was completely empowered to act and no sooner had\\nsuch an end been reached than Anne who had been a most attentive listener\\nto the whole left the room to seek the comfort of cool air for her\\nflushed cheeks and as she walked along a favourite grove said\\nwith a gentle sigh A few months more and he perhaps\\nmay be walking here\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 4\\n\\n\\nHe was not Mr Wentworth the former curate of Monkford\\nhowever suspicious appearances may be but a Captain Frederick Wentworth\\nhis brother who being made commander in consequence of the action\\noff St Domingo and not immediately employed had come into Somersetshire\\nin the summer of 1806 and having no parent living found a home\\nfor half a year at Monkford  He was at that time a remarkably fine\\nyoung man with a great deal of intelligence spirit and brilliancy\\nand Anne an extremely pretty girl with gentleness modesty taste\\nand feeling  Half the sum of attraction on either side might have\\nbeen enough for he had nothing to do and she had hardly anybody to love\\nbut the encounter of such lavish recommendations could not fail\\nThey were gradually acquainted and when acquainted rapidly and\\ndeeply in love  It would be difficult to say which had seen\\nhighest perfection in the other or which had been the happiest\\nshe in receiving his declarations and proposals or he in\\nhaving them accepted\\n\\nA short period of exquisite felicity followed and but a short one\\nTroubles soon arose  Sir Walter on being applied to without actually\\nwithholding his consent or saying it should never be gave it all\\nthe negative of great astonishment great coldness great silence\\nand a professed resolution of doing nothing for his daughter\\nHe thought it a very degrading alliance and Lady Russell though with\\nmore tempered and pardonable pride received it as a most unfortunate one\\n\\nAnne Elliot with all her claims of birth beauty and mind\\nto throw herself away at nineteen involve herself at nineteen\\nin an engagement with a young man who had nothing but himself\\nto recommend him and no hopes of attaining affluence but in the chances\\nof a most uncertain profession and no connexions to secure\\neven his farther rise in the profession would be indeed a throwing away\\nwhich she grieved to think of  Anne Elliot so young known to so few\\nto be snatched off by a stranger without alliance or fortune\\nor rather sunk by him into a state of most wearing anxious\\nyouthkilling dependence  It must not be if by any fair interference\\nof friendship any representations from one who had almost a mothers love\\nand mothers rights it would be prevented\\n\\nCaptain Wentworth had no fortune  He had been lucky in his profession\\nbut spending freely what had come freely had realized nothing\\nBut he was confident that he should soon be rich\\nfull of life and ardour he knew that he should soon have a ship\\nand soon be on a station that would lead to everything he wanted\\nHe had always been lucky he knew he should be so still\\nSuch confidence powerful in its own warmth and bewitching in\\nthe wit which often expressed it must have been enough for Anne\\nbut Lady Russell saw it very differently  His sanguine temper\\nand fearlessness of mind operated very differently on her\\nShe saw in it but an aggravation of the evil  It only added a\\ndangerous character to himself  He was brilliant he was headstrong\\nLady Russell had little taste for wit and of anything approaching\\nto imprudence a horror  She deprecated the connexion in every light\\n\\nSuch opposition as these feelings produced was more than\\nAnne could combat  Young and gentle as she was it might yet\\nhave been possible to withstand her fathers illwill\\nthough unsoftened by one kind word or look on the part of her sister\\nbut Lady Russell whom she had always loved and relied on could not\\nwith such steadiness of opinion and such tenderness of manner\\nbe continually advising her in vain  She was persuaded to believe\\nthe engagement a wrong thing  indiscreet improper hardly capable\\nof success and not deserving it  But it was not a merely selfish caution\\nunder which she acted in putting an end to it  Had she not\\nimagined herself consulting his good even more than her own\\nshe could hardly have given him up  The belief of being prudent\\nand selfdenying principally for his advantage was her chief consolation\\nunder the misery of a parting a final parting and every consolation\\nwas required for she had to encounter all the additional pain of opinions\\non his side totally unconvinced and unbending and of his feeling himself\\nill used by so forced a relinquishment  He had left the country\\nin consequence\\n\\nA few months had seen the beginning and the end of their acquaintance\\nbut not with a few months ended Annes share of suffering from it\\nHer attachment and regrets had for a long time clouded every\\nenjoyment of youth and an early loss of bloom and spirits\\nhad been their lasting effect\\n\\nMore than seven years were gone since this little history\\nof sorrowful interest had reached its close and time had\\nsoftened down much perhaps nearly all of peculiar attachment to him\\nbut she had been too dependent on time alone no aid had been given\\nin change of place except in one visit to Bath soon after the rupture\\nor in any novelty or enlargement of society  No one had ever\\ncome within the Kellynch circle who could bear a comparison with\\nFrederick Wentworth as he stood in her memory  No second attachment\\nthe only thoroughly natural happy and sufficient cure\\nat her time of life had been possible to the nice tone of her mind\\nthe fastidiousness of her taste in the small limits of the society\\naround them  She had been solicited when about twoandtwenty\\nto change her name by the young man who not long afterwards found\\na more willing mind in her younger sister and Lady Russell had\\nlamented her refusal for Charles Musgrove was the eldest son of a man\\nwhose landed property and general importance were second in that country\\nonly to Sir Walters and of good character and appearance\\nand however Lady Russell might have asked yet for something more\\nwhile Anne was nineteen she would have rejoiced to see her at twentytwo\\nso respectably removed from the partialities and injustice of\\nher fathers house and settled so permanently near herself\\nBut in this case Anne had left nothing for advice to do\\nand though Lady Russell as satisfied as ever with her own discretion\\nnever wished the past undone she began now to have the anxiety\\nwhich borders on hopelessness for Annes being tempted by some man\\nof talents and independence to enter a state for which she held her\\nto be peculiarly fitted by her warm affections and domestic habits\\n\\nThey knew not each others opinion either its constancy or its change\\non the one leading point of Annes conduct for the subject was never\\nalluded to but Anne at sevenandtwenty thought very differently\\nfrom what she had been made to think at nineteen  She did not blame\\nLady Russell she did not blame herself for having been guided by her\\nbut she felt that were any young person in similar circumstances\\nto apply to her for counsel they would never receive any of such\\ncertain immediate wretchedness such uncertain future good\\nShe was persuaded that under every disadvantage of disapprobation at home\\nand every anxiety attending his profession all their probable fears\\ndelays and disappointments she should yet have been a happier woman\\nin maintaining the engagement than she had been in the sacrifice of it\\nand this she fully believed had the usual share had even more than\\nthe usual share of all such solicitudes and suspense been theirs\\nwithout reference to the actual results of their case which\\nas it happened would have bestowed earlier prosperity than\\ncould be reasonably calculated on  All his sanguine expectations\\nall his confidence had been justified  His genius and ardour\\nhad seemed to foresee and to command his prosperous path\\nHe had very soon after their engagement ceased got employ\\nand all that he had told her would follow had taken place\\nHe had distinguished himself and early gained the other step in rank\\nand must now by successive captures have made a handsome fortune\\nShe had only navy lists and newspapers for her authority\\nbut she could not doubt his being rich and in favour of his constancy\\nshe had no reason to believe him married\\n\\nHow eloquent could Anne Elliot have been how eloquent at least\\nwere her wishes on the side of early warm attachment and a cheerful\\nconfidence in futurity against that overanxious caution which\\nseems to insult exertion and distrust Providence  She had been forced\\ninto prudence in her youth she learned romance as she grew older\\nthe natural sequel of an unnatural beginning\\n\\nWith all these circumstances recollections and feelings\\nshe could not hear that Captain Wentworths sister was likely\\nto live at Kellynch without a revival of former pain and many a stroll\\nand many a sigh were necessary to dispel the agitation of the idea\\nShe often told herself it was folly before she could harden her nerves\\nsufficiently to feel the continual discussion of the Crofts\\nand their business no evil  She was assisted however by that\\nperfect indifference and apparent unconsciousness among the only three\\nof her own friends in the secret of the past which seemed almost to deny\\nany recollection of it  She could do justice to the superiority\\nof Lady Russells motives in this over those of her father and Elizabeth\\nshe could honour all the better feelings of her calmness\\nbut the general air of oblivion among them was highly important\\nfrom whatever it sprung and in the event of Admiral Crofts really\\ntaking Kellynch Hall she rejoiced anew over the conviction which\\nhad always been most grateful to her of the past being known to\\nthose three only among her connexions by whom no syllable\\nshe believed would ever be whispered and in the trust that among his\\nthe brother only with whom he had been residing had received\\nany information of their shortlived engagement  That brother had been\\nlong removed from the country and being a sensible man and moreover\\na single man at the time she had a fond dependence on no human creatures\\nhaving heard of it from him\\n\\nThe sister Mrs Croft had then been out of England accompanying\\nher husband on a foreign station and her own sister Mary\\nhad been at school while it all occurred and never admitted by\\nthe pride of some and the delicacy of others to the smallest knowledge\\nof it afterwards\\n\\nWith these supports she hoped that the acquaintance between herself\\nand the Crofts which with Lady Russell still resident in Kellynch\\nand Mary fixed only three miles off must be anticipated\\nneed not involve any particular awkwardness\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 5\\n\\n\\nOn the morning appointed for Admiral and Mrs Crofts seeing Kellynch Hall\\nAnne found it most natural to take her almost daily walk to Lady Russells\\nand keep out of the way till all was over when she found it most natural\\nto be sorry that she had missed the opportunity of seeing them\\n\\nThis meeting of the two parties proved highly satisfactory\\nand decided the whole business at once  Each lady was previously\\nwell disposed for an agreement and saw nothing therefore\\nbut good manners in the other and with regard to the gentlemen\\nthere was such an hearty good humour such an open trusting liberality\\non the Admirals side as could not but influence Sir Walter\\nwho had besides been flattered into his very best and most polished\\nbehaviour by Mr Shepherds assurances of his being known by report\\nto the Admiral as a model of good breeding\\n\\nThe house and grounds and furniture were approved the Crofts\\nwere approved terms time every thing and every body was right\\nand Mr Shepherds clerks were set to work without there having been\\na single preliminary difference to modify of all that\\nThis indenture sheweth\\n\\nSir Walter without hesitation declared the Admiral to be\\nthe bestlooking sailor he had ever met with and went so far as to say\\nthat if his own man might have had the arranging of his hair\\nhe should not be ashamed of being seen with him any where\\nand the Admiral with sympathetic cordiality observed to his wife\\nas they drove back through the park I thought we should soon\\ncome to a deal my dear in spite of what they told us at Taunton\\nThe Baronet will never set the Thames on fire but there seems to be\\nno harm in him  reciprocal compliments which would have been\\nesteemed about equal\\n\\nThe Crofts were to have possession at Michaelmas and as Sir Walter\\nproposed removing to Bath in the course of the preceding month\\nthere was no time to be lost in making every dependent arrangement\\n\\nLady Russell convinced that Anne would not be allowed to be of any use\\nor any importance in the choice of the house which they were\\ngoing to secure was very unwilling to have her hurried away so soon\\nand wanted to make it possible for her to stay behind till she might\\nconvey her to Bath herself after Christmas but having engagements\\nof her own which must take her from Kellynch for several weeks\\nshe was unable to give the full invitation she wished and Anne\\nthough dreading the possible heats of September in all the white glare\\nof Bath and grieving to forego all the influence so sweet and so sad\\nof the autumnal months in the country did not think that\\neverything considered she wished to remain  It would be most right\\nand most wise and therefore must involve least suffering\\nto go with the others\\n\\nSomething occurred however to give her a different duty\\nMary often a little unwell and always thinking a great deal\\nof her own complaints and always in the habit of claiming Anne\\nwhen anything was the matter was indisposed and foreseeing\\nthat she should not have a days health all the autumn entreated\\nor rather required her for it was hardly entreaty to come to\\nUppercross Cottage and bear her company as long as she should want her\\ninstead of going to Bath\\n\\nI cannot possibly do without Anne was Marys reasoning\\nand Elizabeths reply was Then I am sure Anne had better stay\\nfor nobody will want her in Bath\\n\\nTo be claimed as a good though in an improper style is at least\\nbetter than being rejected as no good at all and Anne glad to\\nbe thought of some use glad to have anything marked out as a duty\\nand certainly not sorry to have the scene of it in the country\\nand her own dear country readily agreed to stay\\n\\nThis invitation of Marys removed all Lady Russells difficulties\\nand it was consequently soon settled that Anne should not go to Bath\\ntill Lady Russell took her and that all the intervening time\\nshould be divided between Uppercross Cottage and Kellynch Lodge\\n\\nSo far all was perfectly right but Lady Russell was almost startled\\nby the wrong of one part of the Kellynch Hall plan when it burst on her\\nwhich was Mrs Clays being engaged to go to Bath with Sir Walter\\nand Elizabeth as a most important and valuable assistant to the latter\\nin all the business before her  Lady Russell was extremely sorry\\nthat such a measure should have been resorted to at all wondered\\ngrieved and feared and the affront it contained to Anne\\nin Mrs Clays being of so much use while Anne could be of none\\nwas a very sore aggravation\\n\\nAnne herself was become hardened to such affronts but she felt\\nthe imprudence of the arrangement quite as keenly as Lady Russell\\nWith a great deal of quiet observation and a knowledge\\nwhich she often wished less of her fathers character she was\\nsensible that results the most serious to his family from the intimacy\\nwere more than possible  She did not imagine that her father\\nhad at present an idea of the kind  Mrs Clay had freckles\\nand a projecting tooth and a clumsy wrist which he was continually\\nmaking severe remarks upon in her absence but she was young\\nand certainly altogether welllooking and possessed in an acute mind\\nand assiduous pleasing manners infinitely more dangerous attractions\\nthan any merely personal might have been  Anne was so impressed\\nby the degree of their danger that she could not excuse herself\\nfrom trying to make it perceptible to her sister  She had little hope\\nof success but Elizabeth who in the event of such a reverse would be\\nso much more to be pitied than herself should never she thought\\nhave reason to reproach her for giving no warning\\n\\nShe spoke and seemed only to offend  Elizabeth could not conceive\\nhow such an absurd suspicion should occur to her and indignantly\\nanswered for each partys perfectly knowing their situation\\n\\nMrs Clay said she warmly never forgets who she is\\nand as I am rather better acquainted with her sentiments than you can be\\nI can assure you that upon the subject of marriage they are\\nparticularly nice and that she reprobates all inequality of condition\\nand rank more strongly than most people  And as to my father\\nI really should not have thought that he who has kept himself single\\nso long for our sakes need be suspected now  If Mrs Clay were\\na very beautiful woman I grant you it might be wrong to have her\\nso much with me not that anything in the world I am sure\\nwould induce my father to make a degrading match but he might\\nbe rendered unhappy  But poor Mrs Clay who with all her merits\\ncan never have been reckoned tolerably pretty I really think poor\\nMrs Clay may be staying here in perfect safety  One would imagine\\nyou had never heard my father speak of her personal misfortunes\\nthough I know you must fifty times  That tooth of hers\\nand those freckles  Freckles do not disgust me so very much\\nas they do him  I have known a face not materially disfigured by a few\\nbut he abominates them  You must have heard him notice\\nMrs Clays freckles\\n\\nThere is hardly any personal defect replied Anne\\nwhich an agreeable manner might not gradually reconcile one to\\n\\nI think very differently answered Elizabeth shortly\\nan agreeable manner may set off handsome features but can never\\nalter plain ones  However at any rate as I have a great deal more\\nat stake on this point than anybody else can have I think it\\nrather unnecessary in you to be advising me\\n\\nAnne had done glad that it was over and not absolutely hopeless\\nof doing good  Elizabeth though resenting the suspicion\\nmight yet be made observant by it\\n\\nThe last office of the four carriagehorses was to draw Sir Walter\\nMiss Elliot and Mrs Clay to Bath  The party drove off in very good spirits\\nSir Walter prepared with condescending bows for all the afflicted\\ntenantry and cottagers who might have had a hint to show themselves\\nand Anne walked up at the same time in a sort of desolate tranquillity\\nto the Lodge where she was to spend the first week\\n\\nHer friend was not in better spirits than herself Lady Russell felt this\\nbreakup of the family exceedingly  Their respectability was\\nas dear to her as her own and a daily intercourse had become\\nprecious by habit  It was painful to look upon their deserted grounds\\nand still worse to anticipate the new hands they were to fall into\\nand to escape the solitariness and the melancholy of so altered a village\\nand be out of the way when Admiral and Mrs Croft first arrived\\nshe had determined to make her own absence from home begin\\nwhen she must give up Anne  Accordingly their removal was made together\\nand Anne was set down at Uppercross Cottage in the first stage\\nof Lady Russells journey\\n\\nUppercross was a moderatesized village which a few years back\\nhad been completely in the old English style containing only\\ntwo houses superior in appearance to those of the yeomen and labourers\\nthe mansion of the squire with its high walls great gates and old trees\\nsubstantial and unmodernized and the compact tight parsonage\\nenclosed in its own neat garden with a vine and a peartree\\ntrained round its casements but upon the marriage of the young squire\\nit had received the improvement of a farmhouse elevated into a cottage\\nfor his residence and Uppercross Cottage with its veranda\\nFrench windows and other prettiness was quite as likely to catch\\nthe travellers eye as the more consistent and considerable aspect\\nand premises of the Great House about a quarter of a mile farther on\\n\\nHere Anne had often been staying  She knew the ways of Uppercross\\nas well as those of Kellynch  The two families were so continually meeting\\nso much in the habit of running in and out of each others house\\nat all hours that it was rather a surprise to her to find Mary alone\\nbut being alone her being unwell and out of spirits was almost\\na matter of course  Though better endowed than the elder sister\\nMary had not Annes understanding nor temper  While well and happy\\nand properly attended to she had great good humour and excellent spirits\\nbut any indisposition sunk her completely  She had no resources\\nfor solitude and inheriting a considerable share of the Elliot\\nselfimportance was very prone to add to every other distress\\nthat of fancying herself neglected and illused  In person she was\\ninferior to both sisters and had even in her bloom only reached\\nthe dignity of being a fine girl  She was now lying on the faded sofa\\nof the pretty little drawingroom the once elegant furniture of which\\nhad been gradually growing shabby under the influence of four summers\\nand two children and on Annes appearing greeted her with\\n\\nSo you are come at last  I began to think I should never see you\\nI am so ill I can hardly speak  I have not seen a creature\\nthe whole morning\\n\\nI am sorry to find you unwell replied Anne  You sent me\\nsuch a good account of yourself on Thursday\\n\\nYes I made the best of it I always do  but I was very far from well\\nat the time and I do not think I ever was so ill in my life\\nas I have been all this morning  very unfit to be left alone I am sure\\nSuppose I were to be seized of a sudden in some dreadful way\\nand not able to ring the bell  So Lady Russell would not get out\\nI do not think she has been in this house three times this summer\\n\\nAnne said what was proper and enquired after her husband\\nOh Charles is out shooting  I have not seen him since seven oclock\\nHe would go though I told him how ill I was  He said he should not\\nstay out long but he has never come back and now it is almost one\\nI assure you I have not seen a soul this whole long morning\\n\\nYou have had your little boys with you\\n\\nYes as long as I could bear their noise but they are so unmanageable\\nthat they do me more harm than good  Little Charles does not mind\\na word I say and Walter is growing quite as bad\\n\\nWell you will soon be better now replied Anne cheerfully\\nYou know I always cure you when I come  How are your neighbours\\nat the Great House\\n\\nI can give you no account of them  I have not seen one of them today\\nexcept Mr Musgrove who just stopped and spoke through the window\\nbut without getting off his horse and though I told him how ill I was\\nnot one of them have been near me  It did not happen to suit\\nthe Miss Musgroves I suppose and they never put themselves\\nout of their way\\n\\nYou will see them yet perhaps before the morning is gone\\nIt is early\\n\\nI never want them I assure you  They talk and laugh a great deal\\ntoo much for me  Oh Anne I am so very unwell  It was quite unkind\\nof you not to come on Thursday\\n\\nMy dear Mary recollect what a comfortable account you sent me of yourself\\nYou wrote in the cheerfullest manner and said you were perfectly well\\nand in no hurry for me and that being the case you must be aware\\nthat my wish would be to remain with Lady Russell to the last\\nand besides what I felt on her account I have really been so busy\\nhave had so much to do that I could not very conveniently have\\nleft Kellynch sooner\\n\\nDear me what can you possibly have to do\\n\\nA great many things I assure you  More than I can recollect\\nin a moment but I can tell you some  I have been making\\na duplicate of the catalogue of my fathers books and pictures\\nI have been several times in the garden with Mackenzie\\ntrying to understand and make him understand which of Elizabeths plants\\nare for Lady Russell  I have had all my own little concerns\\nto arrange books and music to divide and all my trunks to repack\\nfrom not having understood in time what was intended as to the waggons\\nand one thing I have had to do Mary of a more trying nature\\ngoing to almost every house in the parish as a sort of takeleave\\nI was told that they wished it  But all these things took up\\na great deal of time\\n\\nOh well and after a moments pause but you have never asked me\\none word about our dinner at the Pooles yesterday\\n\\nDid you go then  I have made no enquiries because I concluded\\nyou must have been obliged to give up the party\\n\\nOh yes I went  I was very well yesterday nothing at all\\nthe matter with me till this morning  It would have been strange\\nif I had not gone\\n\\nI am very glad you were well enough and I hope you had a pleasant party\\n\\nNothing remarkable  One always knows beforehand what the dinner will be\\nand who will be there and it is so very uncomfortable not having\\na carriage of ones own  Mr and Mrs Musgrove took me and we were\\nso crowded  They are both so very large and take up so much room\\nand Mr Musgrove always sits forward  So there was I crowded into\\nthe back seat with Henrietta and Louise and I think it very likely\\nthat my illness today may be owing to it\\n\\nA little further perseverance in patience and forced cheerfulness\\non Annes side produced nearly a cure on Marys  She could soon\\nsit upright on the sofa and began to hope she might be able\\nto leave it by dinnertime  Then forgetting to think of it\\nshe was at the other end of the room beautifying a nosegay\\nthen she ate her cold meat and then she was well enough\\nto propose a little walk\\n\\nWhere shall we go said she when they were ready  I suppose\\nyou will not like to call at the Great House before they have\\nbeen to see you\\n\\nI have not the smallest objection on that account replied Anne\\nI should never think of standing on such ceremony with people I know\\nso well as Mrs and the Miss Musgroves\\n\\nOh but they ought to call upon you as soon as possible\\nThey ought to feel what is due to you as my sister  However\\nwe may as well go and sit with them a little  while and when we\\nhave that over we can enjoy our walk\\n\\nAnne had always thought such a style of intercourse highly imprudent\\nbut she had ceased to endeavour to check it from believing that\\nthough there were on each side continual subjects of offence\\nneither family could now do without it  To the Great House accordingly\\nthey went to sit the full half hour in the oldfashioned square parlour\\nwith a small carpet and shining floor to which the present\\ndaughters of the house were gradually giving the proper air of confusion\\nby a grand pianoforte and a harp flowerstands and little tables\\nplaced in every direction  Oh could the originals of the portraits\\nagainst the wainscot could the gentlemen in brown velvet and\\nthe ladies in blue satin have seen what was going on have been conscious\\nof such an overthrow of all order and neatness  The portraits themselves\\nseemed to be staring in astonishment\\n\\nThe Musgroves like their houses were in a state of alteration\\nperhaps of improvement  The father and mother were in the old\\nEnglish style and the young people in the new  Mr and Mrs Musgrove\\nwere a very good sort of people friendly and hospitable\\nnot much educated and not at all elegant  Their children had\\nmore modern minds and manners  There was a numerous family\\nbut the only two grown up excepting Charles were Henrietta and Louisa\\nyoung ladies of nineteen and twenty who had brought from school at Exeter\\nall the usual stock of accomplishments and were now like thousands\\nof other young ladies living to be fashionable happy and merry\\nTheir dress had every advantage their faces were rather pretty\\ntheir spirits extremely good their manner unembarrassed and pleasant\\nthey were of consequence at home and favourites abroad\\nAnne always contemplated them as some of the happiest creatures\\nof her acquaintance but still saved as we all are by some\\ncomfortable feeling of superiority from wishing for the possibility\\nof exchange she would not have given up her own more elegant\\nand cultivated mind for all their enjoyments and envied them nothing\\nbut that seemingly perfect good understanding and agreement together\\nthat goodhumoured mutual affection of which she had known\\nso little herself with either of her sisters\\n\\nThey were received with great cordiality  Nothing seemed amiss\\non the side of the Great House family which was generally\\nas Anne very well knew the least to blame  The half hour was\\nchatted away pleasantly enough and she was not at all surprised\\nat the end of it to have their walking party joined by both\\nthe Miss Musgroves at Marys particular invitation\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 6\\n\\n\\nAnne had not wanted this visit to Uppercross to learn that a removal\\nfrom one set of people to another though at a distance of only three miles\\nwill often include a total change of conversation opinion and idea\\nShe had never been staying there before without being struck by it\\nor without wishing that other Elliots could have her advantage\\nin seeing how unknown or unconsidered there were the affairs\\nwhich at Kellynch Hall were treated as of such general publicity\\nand pervading interest yet with all this experience she believed\\nshe must now submit to feel that another lesson in the art of knowing\\nour own nothingness beyond our own circle was become necessary for her\\nfor certainly coming as she did with a heart full of the subject\\nwhich had been completely occupying both houses in Kellynch for many weeks\\nshe had expected rather more curiosity and sympathy than she found\\nin the separate but very similar remark of Mr and Mrs Musgrove\\nSo Miss Anne Sir Walter and your sister are gone and what part of Bath\\ndo you think they will settle in and this without much\\nwaiting for an answer or in the young ladies addition of\\nI hope we shall be in Bath in the winter but remember papa\\nif we do go we must be in a good situation  none of your\\nQueen Squares for us or in the anxious supplement from Mary of\\nUpon my word I shall be pretty well off when you are all gone away\\nto be happy at Bath\\n\\nShe could only resolve to avoid such selfdelusion in future\\nand think with heightened gratitude of the extraordinary blessing\\nof having one such truly sympathising friend as Lady Russell\\n\\nThe Mr Musgroves had their own game to guard and to destroy\\ntheir own horses dogs and newspapers to engage them and the females\\nwere fully occupied in all the other common subjects of housekeeping\\nneighbours dress dancing and music  She acknowledged it to be\\nvery fitting that every little social commonwealth should dictate\\nits own matters of discourse and hoped ere long to become\\na not unworthy member of the one she was now transplanted into\\nWith the prospect of spending at least two months at Uppercross\\nit was highly incumbent on her to clothe her imagination her memory\\nand all her ideas in as much of Uppercross as possible\\n\\nShe had no dread of these two months  Mary was not so repulsive\\nand unsisterly as Elizabeth nor so inaccessible to all influence of hers\\nneither was there anything among the other component parts\\nof the cottage inimical to comfort  She was always on friendly terms\\nwith her brotherinlaw and in the children who loved her nearly as well\\nand respected her a great deal more than their mother she had\\nan object of interest amusement and wholesome exertion\\n\\nCharles Musgrove was civil and agreeable in sense and temper he was\\nundoubtedly superior to his wife but not of powers or conversation\\nor grace to make the past as they were connected together\\nat all a dangerous contemplation though at the same time\\nAnne could believe with Lady Russell that a more equal match\\nmight have greatly improved him and that a woman of real understanding\\nmight have given more consequence to his character and more usefulness\\nrationality and elegance to his habits and pursuits  As it was\\nhe did nothing with much zeal but sport and his time was otherwise\\ntrifled away without benefit from books or anything else\\nHe had very good spirits which never seemed much affected by\\nhis wifes occasional lowness bore with her unreasonableness\\nsometimes to Annes admiration and upon the whole though there was\\nvery often a little disagreement in which she had sometimes more share\\nthan she wished being appealed to by both parties they might pass\\nfor a happy couple  They were always perfectly agreed in the want\\nof more money and a strong inclination for a handsome present\\nfrom his father but here as on most topics he had the superiority\\nfor while Mary thought it a great shame that such a present was not made\\nhe always contended for his fathers having many other uses for his money\\nand a right to spend it as he liked\\n\\nAs to the management of their children his theory was much better\\nthan his wifes and his practice not so bad  I could manage them\\nvery well if it were not for Marys interference was what\\nAnne often heard him say and had a good deal of faith in\\nbut when listening in turn to Marys reproach of Charles spoils\\nthe children so that I cannot get them into any order she never had\\nthe smallest temptation to say Very true\\n\\nOne of the least agreeable circumstances of her residence there\\nwas her being treated with too much confidence by all parties\\nand being too much in the secret of the complaints of each house\\nKnown to have some influence with her sister she was continually requested\\nor at least receiving hints to exert it beyond what was practicable\\nI wish you could persuade Mary not to be always fancying herself ill\\nwas Charless language and in an unhappy mood thus spoke Mary\\nI do believe if Charles were to see me dying he would not think\\nthere was anything the matter with me  I am sure Anne if you would\\nyou might persuade him that I really am very illa great deal worse\\nthan I ever own\\n\\nMarys declaration was I hate sending the children to the Great House\\nthough their grandmamma is always wanting to see them for she humours\\nand indulges them to such a degree and gives them so much trash\\nand sweet things that they are sure to come back sick and cross\\nfor the rest of the day  And Mrs Musgrove took the first opportunity\\nof being alone with Anne to say Oh Miss Anne I cannot help wishing\\nMrs Charles had a little of your method with those children\\nThey are quite different creatures with you  But to be sure\\nin general they are so spoilt  It is a pity you cannot put your sister\\nin the way of managing them  They are as fine healthy children\\nas ever were seen poor little dears without partiality\\nbut Mrs Charles knows no more how they should be treated\\nBless me how troublesome they are sometimes  I assure you Miss Anne\\nit prevents my wishing to see them at our house so often as\\nI otherwise should  I believe Mrs Charles is not quite pleased\\nwith my not inviting them oftener but you know it is very bad\\nto have children with one that one is obligated to be checking\\nevery moment dont do this and dont do that  or that one can\\nonly keep in tolerable order by more cake than is good for them\\n\\nShe had this communication moreover from Mary  Mrs Musgrove thinks\\nall her servants so steady that it would be high treason\\nto call it in question but I am sure without exaggeration\\nthat her upper housemaid and laundrymaid instead of being\\nin their business are gadding about the village all day long\\nI meet them wherever I go and I declare I never go twice into my nursery\\nwithout seeing something of them  If Jemima were not the trustiest\\nsteadiest creature in the world it would be enough to spoil her\\nfor she tells me they are always tempting her to take a walk with them\\nAnd on Mrs Musgroves side it was I make a rule of never interfering\\nin any of my daughterinlaws concerns for I know it would not do\\nbut I shall tell you Miss Anne because you may be able to set things\\nto rights that I have no very good opinion of Mrs Charless nurserymaid\\nI hear strange stories of her she is always upon the gad and from\\nmy own knowledge I can declare she is such a finedressing lady\\nthat she is enough to ruin any servants she comes near\\nMrs Charles quite swears by her I know but I just give you this hint\\nthat you may be upon the watch because if you see anything amiss\\nyou need not be afraid of mentioning it\\n\\nAgain it was Marys complaint that Mrs Musgrove was very apt\\nnot to give her the precedence that was her due when they dined\\nat the Great House with other families and she did not see any reason\\nwhy she was to be considered so much at home as to lose her place\\nAnd one day when Anne was walking with only the Musgroves one of them\\nafter talking of rank people of rank and jealousy of rank said\\nI have no scruple of observing to you how nonsensical some persons are\\nabout their place because all the world knows how easy and indifferent\\nyou are about it but I wish anybody could give Mary a hint that\\nit would be a great deal better if she were not so very tenacious\\nespecially if she would not be always putting herself forward to take\\nplace of mamma  Nobody doubts her right to have precedence of mamma\\nbut it would be more becoming in her not to be always insisting on it\\nIt is not that mamma cares about it the least in the world\\nbut I know it is taken notice of by many persons\\n\\nHow was Anne to set all these matters to rights  She could do little more\\nthan listen patiently soften every grievance and excuse each\\nto the other give them all hints of the forbearance necessary\\nbetween such near neighbours and make those hints broadest\\nwhich were meant for her sisters benefit\\n\\nIn all other respects her visit began and proceeded very well\\nHer own spirits improved by change of place and subject\\nby being removed three miles from Kellynch Marys ailments lessened\\nby having a constant companion and their daily intercourse\\nwith the other family since there was neither superior affection\\nconfidence nor employment in the cottage to be interrupted by it\\nwas rather an advantage  It was certainly carried nearly as far as possible\\nfor they met every morning and hardly ever spent an evening asunder\\nbut she believed they should not have done so well without the sight\\nof Mr and Mrs Musgroves respectable forms in the usual places\\nor without the talking laughing and singing of their daughters\\n\\nShe played a great deal better than either of the Miss Musgroves\\nbut having no voice no knowledge of the harp and no fond parents\\nto sit by and fancy themselves delighted her performance was\\nlittle thought of only out of civility or to refresh the others\\nas she was well aware  She knew that when she played she was\\ngiving pleasure only to herself but this was no new sensation\\nExcepting one short period of her life she had never since the age\\nof fourteen never since the loss of her dear mother known the happiness\\nof being listened to or encouraged by any just appreciation or real taste\\nIn music she had been always used to feel alone in the world\\nand Mr and Mrs Musgroves fond partiality for their own daughters\\nperformance and total indifference to any other persons\\ngave her much more pleasure for their sakes than mortification\\nfor her own\\n\\nThe party at the Great House was sometimes increased by other company\\nThe neighbourhood was not large but the Musgroves were visited\\nby everybody and had more dinnerparties and more callers\\nmore visitors by invitation and by chance than any other family\\nThere were more completely popular\\n\\nThe girls were wild for dancing and the evenings ended occasionally\\nin an unpremeditated little ball  There was a family of cousins\\nwithin a walk of Uppercross in less affluent circumstances\\nwho depended on the Musgroves for all their pleasures  they would come\\nat any time and help play at anything or dance anywhere and Anne\\nvery much preferring the office of musician to a more active post\\nplayed country dances to them by the hour together a kindness which\\nalways recommended her musical powers to the notice of Mr and Mrs Musgrove\\nmore than anything else and often drew this compliment\\nWell done Miss Anne very well done indeed  Lord bless me\\nhow those little fingers of yours fly about\\n\\nSo passed the first three weeks  Michaelmas came and now Annes heart\\nmust be in Kellynch again  A beloved home made over to others\\nall the precious rooms and furniture groves and prospects\\nbeginning to own other eyes and other limbs  She could not\\nthink of much else on the 29th of September and she had this\\nsympathetic touch in the evening from Mary who on having occasion\\nto note down the day of the month exclaimed Dear me is not this\\nthe day the Crofts were to come to Kellynch  I am glad I did not\\nthink of it before  How low it makes me\\n\\nThe Crofts took possession with true naval alertness and were\\nto be visited  Mary deplored the necessity for herself\\nNobody knew how much she should suffer  She should put it off\\nas long as she could but was not easy till she had talked Charles\\ninto driving her over on an early day and was in a very animated\\ncomfortable state of imaginary agitation when she came back\\nAnne had very sincerely rejoiced in there being no means of her going\\nShe wished however to see the Crofts and was glad to be within\\nwhen the visit was returned  They came  the master of the house\\nwas not at home but the two sisters were together and as it chanced\\nthat Mrs Croft fell to the share of Anne while the Admiral sat by Mary\\nand made himself very agreeable by his goodhumoured notice\\nof her little boys she was well able to watch for a likeness\\nand if it failed her in the features to catch it in the voice\\nor in the turn of sentiment and expression\\n\\nMrs Croft though neither tall nor fat had a squareness\\nuprightness and vigour of form which gave importance to her person\\nShe had bright dark eyes good teeth and altogether an agreeable face\\nthough her reddened and weatherbeaten complexion the consequence\\nof her having been almost as much at sea as her husband made her seem to\\nhave lived some years longer in the world than her real eightandthirty\\nHer manners were open easy and decided like one who had\\nno distrust of herself and no doubts of what to do without any\\napproach to coarseness however or any want of good humour\\nAnne gave her credit indeed for feelings of great consideration\\ntowards herself in all that related to Kellynch and it pleased her\\nespecially as she had satisfied herself in the very first half minute\\nin the instant even of introduction that there was not the smallest\\nsymptom of any knowledge or suspicion on Mrs Crofts side to give a bias\\nof any sort  She was quite easy on that head and consequently\\nfull of strength and courage till for a moment electrified by\\nMrs Crofts suddenly saying\\n\\nIt was you and not your sister I find that my brother had\\nthe pleasure of being acquainted with when he was in this country\\n\\nAnne hoped she had outlived the age of blushing but the age of emotion\\nshe certainly had not\\n\\nPerhaps you may not have heard that he is married added Mrs Croft\\n\\nShe could now answer as she ought and was happy to feel\\nwhen Mrs Crofts next words explained it to be Mr Wentworth\\nof whom she spoke that she had said nothing which might not do\\nfor either brother She immediately felt how reasonable it was\\nthat Mrs Croft should be thinking and speaking of Edward\\nand not of Frederick and with shame at her own forgetfulness\\napplied herself to the knowledge of their former neighbours\\npresent state with proper interest\\n\\nThe rest was all tranquillity till just as they were moving\\nshe heard the Admiral say to Mary\\n\\nWe are expecting a brother of Mrs Crofts here soon I dare say\\nyou know him by name\\n\\nHe was cut short by the eager attacks of the little boys\\nclinging to him like an old friend and declaring he should not go\\nand being too much engrossed by proposals of carrying them away\\nin his coat pockets c to have another moment for finishing\\nor recollecting what he had begun Anne was left to persuade herself\\nas well as she could that the same brother must still be in question\\nShe could not however reach such a degree of certainty\\nas not to be anxious to hear whether anything had been said on the subject\\nat the other house where the Crofts had previously been calling\\n\\nThe folks of the Great House were to spend the evening of this day\\nat the Cottage and it being now too late in the year for such visits\\nto be made on foot the coach was beginning to be listened for\\nwhen the youngest Miss Musgrove walked in  That she was coming\\nto apologize and that they should have to spend the evening by themselves\\nwas the first black idea and Mary was quite ready to be affronted\\nwhen Louisa made all right by saying that she only came on foot\\nto leave more room for the harp which was bringing in the carriage\\n\\nAnd I will tell you our reason she added and all about it\\nI am come on to give you notice that papa and mamma are\\nout of spirits this evening especially mamma she is thinking so much\\nof poor Richard  And we agreed it would be best to have the harp\\nfor it seems to amuse her more than the pianoforte  I will tell you\\nwhy she is out of spirits  When the Crofts called this morning\\nthey called here afterwards did not they they happened to say\\nthat her brother Captain Wentworth is just returned to England\\nor paid off or something and is coming to see them almost directly\\nand most unluckily it came into mammas head when they were gone\\nthat Wentworth or something very like it was the name of\\npoor Richards captain at one time I do not know when or where\\nbut a great while before he died poor fellow  And upon looking over\\nhis letters and things she found it was so and is perfectly sure\\nthat this must be the very man and her head is quite full of it\\nand of poor Richard  So we must be as merry as we can that she may not\\nbe dwelling upon such gloomy things\\n\\nThe real circumstances of this pathetic piece of family history were\\nthat the Musgroves had had the ill fortune of a very troublesome\\nhopeless son and the good fortune to lose him before he reached\\nhis twentieth year that he had been sent to sea because he was stupid\\nand unmanageable on shore that he had been very little cared for\\nat any time by his family though quite as much as he deserved\\nseldom heard of and scarcely at all regretted when the intelligence\\nof his death abroad had worked its way to Uppercross two years before\\n\\nHe had in fact though his sisters were now doing all they could for him\\nby calling him poor Richard been nothing better than a thickheaded\\nunfeeling unprofitable Dick Musgrove who had never done anything\\nto entitle himself to more than the abbreviation of his name\\nliving or dead\\n\\nHe had been several years at sea and had in the course of those removals\\nto which all midshipmen are liable and especially such midshipmen\\nas every captain wishes to get rid of been six months on board\\nCaptain Frederick Wentworths frigate the Laconia and from the Laconia\\nhe had under the influence of his captain written the only two letters\\nwhich his father and mother had ever received from him during the whole\\nof his absence that is to say the only two disinterested letters\\nall the rest had been mere applications for money\\n\\nIn each letter he had spoken well of his captain but yet\\nso little were they in the habit of attending to such matters\\nso unobservant and incurious were they as to the names of men or ships\\nthat it had made scarcely any impression at the time and that Mrs Musgrove\\nshould have been suddenly struck this very day with a recollection\\nof the name of Wentworth as connected with her son seemed one of those\\nextraordinary bursts of mind which do sometimes occur\\n\\nShe had gone to her letters and found it all as she supposed\\nand the reperusal of these letters after so long an interval\\nher poor son gone for ever and all the strength of his faults forgotten\\nhad affected her spirits exceedingly and thrown her into\\ngreater grief for him than she had know on first hearing of his death\\nMr Musgrove was in a lesser degree affected likewise and when\\nthey reached the cottage they were evidently in want first\\nof being listened to anew on this subject and afterwards\\nof all the relief which cheerful companions could give them\\n\\nTo hear them talking so much of Captain Wentworth repeating his name\\nso often puzzling over past years and at last ascertaining that it might\\nthat it probably would turn out to be the very same Captain Wentworth\\nwhom they recollected meeting once or twice after their coming back\\nfrom Cliftona very fine young manbut they could not say whether\\nit was seven or eight years ago was a new sort of trial to Annes nerves\\nShe found however that it was one to which she must inure herself\\nSince he actually was expected in the country she must teach herself\\nto be insensible on such points  And not only did it appear that\\nhe was expected and speedily but the Musgroves in their warm gratitude\\nfor the kindness he had shewn poor Dick and very high respect\\nfor his character stamped as it was by poor Dicks having been\\nsix months under his care and mentioning him in strong\\nthough not perfectly wellspelt praise as a fine dashing felow\\nonly two perticular about the schoolmaster were bent on\\nintroducing themselves and seeking his acquaintance as soon as\\nthey could hear of his arrival\\n\\nThe resolution of doing so helped to form the comfort of their evening\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 7\\n\\n\\nA very few days more and Captain Wentworth was known to be at Kellynch\\nand Mr Musgrove had called on him and come back warm in his praise\\nand he was engaged with the Crofts to dine at Uppercross\\nby the end of another week  It had been a great disappointment\\nto Mr Musgrove to find that no earlier day could be fixed\\nso impatient was he to shew his gratitude by seeing Captain Wentworth\\nunder his own roof and welcoming him to all that was strongest\\nand best in his cellars  But a week must pass only a week\\nin Annes reckoning and then she supposed they must meet\\nand soon she began to wish that she could feel secure even for a week\\n\\nCaptain Wentworth made a very early return to Mr Musgroves civility\\nand she was all but calling there in the same half hour\\nShe and Mary were actually setting forward for the Great House\\nwhere as she afterwards learnt they must inevitably have found him\\nwhen they were stopped by the eldest boys being at that moment\\nbrought home in consequence of a bad fall  The childs situation\\nput the visit entirely aside but she could not hear of her escape\\nwith indifference even in the midst of the serious anxiety\\nwhich they afterwards felt on his account\\n\\nHis collarbone was found to be dislocated and such injury\\nreceived in the back as roused the most alarming ideas\\nIt was an afternoon of distress and Anne had every thing to do at once\\nthe apothecary to send for the father to have pursued and informed\\nthe mother to support and keep from hysterics the servants to control\\nthe youngest child to banish and the poor suffering one to attend\\nand soothe besides sending as soon as she recollected it\\nproper notice to the other house which brought her an accession\\nrather of frightened enquiring companions than of very useful assistants\\n\\nHer brothers return was the first comfort he could take best care\\nof his wife and the second blessing was the arrival of the apothecary\\nTill he came and had examined the child their apprehensions were\\nthe worse for being vague they suspected great injury but knew not where\\nbut now the collarbone was soon replaced and though Mr Robinson\\nfelt and felt and rubbed and looked grave and spoke low words\\nboth to the father and the aunt still they were all to hope the best\\nand to be able to part and eat their dinner in tolerable ease of mind\\nand then it was just before they parted that the two young aunts\\nwere able so far to digress from their nephews state as to give\\nthe information of Captain Wentworths visit staying five minutes behind\\ntheir father and mother to endeavour to express how perfectly delighted\\nthey were with him how much handsomer how infinitely more agreeable\\nthey thought him than any individual among their male acquaintance\\nwho had been at all a favourite before  How glad they had been\\nto hear papa invite him to stay dinner how sorry when he said\\nit was quite out of his power and how glad again when he had promised\\nin reply to papa and mammas farther pressing invitations to come\\nand dine with them on the morrowactually on the morrow\\nand he had promised it in so pleasant a manner as if he felt\\nall the motive of their attention just as he ought  And in short\\nhe had looked and said everything with such exquisite grace\\nthat they could assure them all their heads were both turned by him\\nand off they ran quite as full of glee as of love and apparently\\nmore full of Captain Wentworth than of little Charles\\n\\nThe same story and the same raptures were repeated when the two girls came\\nwith their father through the gloom of the evening to make enquiries\\nand Mr Musgrove no longer under the first uneasiness about his heir\\ncould add his confirmation and praise and hope there would be now\\nno occasion for putting Captain Wentworth off and only be sorry to think\\nthat the cottage party probably would not like to leave the little boy\\nto give him the meeting  Oh no as to leaving the little boy\\nboth father and mother were in much too strong and recent alarm\\nto bear the thought and Anne in the joy of the escape\\ncould not help adding her warm protestations to theirs\\n\\nCharles Musgrove indeed afterwards shewed more of inclination\\nthe child was going on so well and he wished so much to be introduced\\nto Captain Wentworth that perhaps he might join them in the evening\\nhe would not dine from home but he might walk in for half an hour\\nBut in this he was eagerly opposed by his wife with Oh no indeed\\nCharles I cannot bear to have you go away  Only think if anything\\nshould happen\\n\\nThe child had a good night and was going on well the next day\\nIt must be a work of time to ascertain that no injury had been\\ndone to the spine but Mr Robinson found nothing to increase alarm\\nand Charles Musgrove began consequently to feel no necessity\\nfor longer confinement  The child was to be kept in bed and amused\\nas quietly as possible but what was there for a father to do\\nThis was quite a female case and it would be highly absurd in him\\nwho could be of no use at home to shut himself up  His father\\nvery much wished him to meet Captain Wentworth and there being\\nno sufficient reason against it he ought to go and it ended in his\\nmaking a bold public declaration when he came in from shooting\\nof his meaning to dress directly and dine at the other house\\n\\nNothing can be going on better than the child said he\\nso I told my father just now that I would come and he thought me\\nquite right  Your sister being with you my love I have no scruple at all\\nYou would not like to leave him yourself but you see I can be of no use\\nAnne will send for me if anything is the matter\\n\\nHusbands and wives generally understand when opposition will be vain\\nMary knew from Charless manner of speaking that he was\\nquite determined on going and that it would be of no use to teaze him\\nShe said nothing therefore till he was out of the room\\nbut as soon as there was only Anne to hear\\n\\nSo you and I are to be left to shift by ourselves with this\\npoor sick child and not a creature coming near us all the evening\\nI knew how it would be  This is always my luck  If there is\\nanything disagreeable going on men are always sure to get out of it\\nand Charles is as bad as any of them  Very unfeeling  I must say\\nit is very unfeeling of him to be running away from his poor little boy\\nTalks of his being going on so well  How does he know that he is\\ngoing on well or that there may not be a sudden change half an hour hence\\nI did not think Charles would have been so unfeeling  So here he is to\\ngo away and enjoy himself and because I am the poor mother\\nI am not to be allowed to stir and yet I am sure I am more unfit\\nthan anybody else to be about the child  My being the mother\\nis the very reason why my feelings should not be tried  I am not at all\\nequal to it  You saw how hysterical I was yesterday\\n\\nBut that was only the effect of the suddenness of your alarm\\nof the shock  You will not be hysterical again  I dare say we shall have\\nnothing to distress us  I perfectly understand Mr Robinsons directions\\nand have no fears and indeed Mary I cannot wonder at your husband\\nNursing does not belong to a man it is not his province\\nA sick child is always the mothers property  her own feelings\\ngenerally make it so\\n\\nI hope I am as fond of my child as any mother but I do not know\\nthat I am of any more use in the sickroom than Charles\\nfor I cannot be always scolding and teazing the poor child when it is ill\\nand you saw this morning that if I told him to keep quiet\\nhe was sure to begin kicking about  I have not nerves\\nfor the sort of thing\\n\\nBut could you be comfortable yourself to be spending\\nthe whole evening away from the poor boy\\n\\nYes you see his papa can and why should not I  Jemima is so careful\\nand she could send us word every hour how he was  I really think\\nCharles might as well have told his father we would all come\\nI am not more alarmed about little Charles now than he is\\nI was dreadfully alarmed yesterday but the case is very different today\\n\\nWell if you do not think it too late to give notice for yourself\\nsuppose you were to go as well as your husband  Leave little Charles\\nto my care  Mr and Mrs Musgrove cannot think it wrong while I remain\\nwith him\\n\\nAre you serious cried Mary her eyes brightening  Dear me\\nthats a very good thought very good indeed  To be sure\\nI may just as well go as not for I am of no use at homeam I\\nand it only harasses me  You who have not a mothers feelings\\nare a great deal the properest person  You can make little Charles\\ndo anything he always minds you at a word  It will be a great deal better\\nthan leaving him only with Jemima  Oh I shall certainly go\\nI am sure I ought if I can quite as much as Charles for they want me\\nexcessively to be acquainted with Captain Wentworth and I know\\nyou do not mind being left alone  An excellent thought of yours\\nindeed Anne  I will go and tell Charles and get ready directly\\nYou can send for us you know at a moments notice if anything\\nis the matter but I dare say there will be nothing to alarm you\\nI should not go you may be sure if I did not feel quite at ease\\nabout my dear child\\n\\nThe next moment she was tapping at her husbands dressingroom door\\nand as Anne followed her up stairs she was in time for\\nthe whole conversation which began with Marys saying\\nin a tone of great exultation\\n\\nI mean to go with you Charles for I am of no more use at home\\nthan you are  If I were to shut myself up for ever with the child\\nI should not be able to persuade him to do anything he did not like\\nAnne will stay Anne undertakes to stay at home and take care of him\\nIt is Annes own proposal and so I shall go with you which will be\\na great deal better for I have not dined at the other house since Tuesday\\n\\nThis is very kind of Anne was her husbands answer and I should be\\nvery glad to have you go but it seems rather hard that she should be\\nleft at home by herself to nurse our sick child\\n\\nAnne was now at hand to take up her own cause and the sincerity\\nof her manner being soon sufficient to convince him where conviction\\nwas at least very agreeable he had no farther scruples as to her being\\nleft to dine alone though he still wanted her to join them in the evening\\nwhen the child might be at rest for the night and kindly urged her\\nto let him come and fetch her but she was quite unpersuadable\\nand this being the case she had ere long the pleasure of seeing them\\nset off together in high spirits  They were gone she hoped\\nto be happy however oddly constructed such happiness might seem\\nas for herself she was left with as many sensations of comfort\\nas were perhaps ever likely to be hers  She knew herself to be\\nof the first utility to the child and what was it to her\\nif Frederick Wentworth were only half a mile distant making himself\\nagreeable to others\\n\\nShe would have liked to know how he felt as to a meeting\\nPerhaps indifferent if indifference could exist under such circumstances\\nHe must be either indifferent or unwilling  Had he wished\\never to see her again he need not have waited till this time\\nhe would have done what she could not but believe that in his place\\nshe should have done long ago when events had been early giving him\\nthe independence which alone had been wanting\\n\\nHer brother and sister came back delighted with their new acquaintance\\nand their visit in general  There had been music singing\\ntalking laughing all that was most agreeable charming manners\\nin Captain Wentworth no shyness or reserve they seemed all\\nto know each other perfectly and he was coming the very next morning\\nto shoot with Charles  He was to come to breakfast but not at the Cottage\\nthough that had been proposed at first but then he had been pressed\\nto come to the Great House instead and he seemed afraid of being\\nin Mrs Charles Musgroves way on account of the child and therefore\\nsomehow they hardly knew how it ended in Charless being to meet him\\nto breakfast at his fathers\\n\\nAnne understood it  He wished to avoid seeing her  He had inquired\\nafter her she found slightly as might suit a former slight acquaintance\\nseeming to acknowledge such as she had acknowledged actuated perhaps\\nby the same view of escaping introduction when they were to meet\\n\\nThe morning hours of the Cottage were always later than those\\nof the other house and on the morrow the difference was so great\\nthat Mary and Anne were not more than beginning breakfast when\\nCharles came in to say that they were just setting off that he was\\ncome for his dogs that his sisters were following with Captain Wentworth\\nhis sisters meaning to visit Mary and the child and Captain Wentworth\\nproposing also to wait on her for a few minutes if not inconvenient\\nand though Charles had answered for the childs being in no such state\\nas could make it inconvenient Captain Wentworth would not be satisfied\\nwithout his running on to give notice\\n\\nMary very much gratified by this attention was delighted to receive him\\nwhile a thousand feelings rushed on Anne of which this was\\nthe most consoling that it would soon be over  And it was soon over\\nIn two minutes after Charless preparation the others appeared\\nthey were in the drawingroom  Her eye half met Captain Wentworths\\na bow a curtsey passed she heard his voice he talked to Mary\\nsaid all that was right said something to the Miss Musgroves\\nenough to mark an easy footing the room seemed full full of persons\\nand voices but a few minutes ended it  Charles shewed himself\\nat the window all was ready their visitor had bowed and was gone\\nthe Miss Musgroves were gone too suddenly resolving to walk\\nto the end of the village with the sportsmen  the room was cleared\\nand Anne might finish her breakfast as she could\\n\\nIt is over it is over she repeated to herself again and again\\nin nervous gratitude  The worst is over\\n\\nMary talked but she could not attend  She had seen him\\nThey had met  They had been once more in the same room\\n\\nSoon however she began to reason with herself and try to be feeling less\\nEight years almost eight years had passed since all had been given up\\nHow absurd to be resuming the agitation which such an interval\\nhad banished into distance and indistinctness  What might not\\neight years do  Events of every description changes alienations\\nremovalsall all must be comprised in it and oblivion of the past\\nhow natural how certain too  It included nearly a third part\\nof her own life\\n\\nAlas with all her reasoning she found that to retentive feelings\\neight years may be little more than nothing\\n\\nNow how were his sentiments to be read  Was this like\\nwishing to avoid her  And the next moment she was hating herself\\nfor the folly which asked the question\\n\\nOn one other question which perhaps her utmost wisdom\\nmight not have prevented she was soon spared all suspense\\nfor after the Miss Musgroves had returned and finished their visit\\nat the Cottage she had this spontaneous information from Mary \\n\\nCaptain Wentworth is not very gallant by you Anne though he was\\nso attentive to me  Henrietta asked him what he thought of you\\nwhen they went away and he said You were so altered he should not\\nhave known you again\\n\\nMary had no feelings to make her respect her sisters in a common way\\nbut she was perfectly unsuspicious of being inflicting any peculiar wound\\n\\nAltered beyond his knowledge  Anne fully submitted in silent\\ndeep mortification  Doubtless it was so and she could take no revenge\\nfor he was not altered or not for the worse  She had already\\nacknowledged it to herself and she could not think differently\\nlet him think of her as he would  No  the years which had destroyed\\nher youth and bloom had only given him a more glowing manly\\nopen look in no respect lessening his personal advantages\\nShe had seen the same Frederick Wentworth\\n\\nSo altered that he should not have known her again  These were words\\nwhich could not but dwell with her  Yet she soon began to rejoice\\nthat she had heard them  They were of sobering tendency\\nthey allayed agitation they composed and consequently must\\nmake her happier\\n\\nFrederick Wentworth had used such words or something like them\\nbut without an idea that they would be carried round to her\\nHe had thought her wretchedly altered and in the first moment of appeal\\nhad spoken as he felt  He had not forgiven Anne Elliot\\nShe had used him ill deserted and disappointed him and worse\\nshe had shewn a feebleness of character in doing so which his own decided\\nconfident temper could not endure  She had given him up to oblige others\\nIt had been the effect of overpersuasion  It had been\\nweakness and timidity\\n\\nHe had been most warmly attached to her and had never seen a woman since\\nwhom he thought her equal but except from some natural sensation\\nof curiosity he had no desire of meeting her again  Her power with him\\nwas gone for ever\\n\\nIt was now his object to marry  He was rich and being turned on shore\\nfully intended to settle as soon as he could be properly tempted\\nactually looking round ready to fall in love with all the speed\\nwhich a clear head and a quick taste could allow  He had a heart\\nfor either of the Miss Musgroves if they could catch it a heart\\nin short for any pleasing young woman who came in his way\\nexcepting Anne Elliot  This was his only secret exception\\nwhen he said to his sister in answer to her suppositions\\n\\nYes here I am Sophia quite ready to make a foolish match\\nAnybody between fifteen and thirty may have me for asking\\nA little beauty and a few smiles and a few compliments to the navy\\nand I am a lost man  Should not this be enough for a sailor\\nwho has had no society among women to make him nice\\n\\nHe said it she knew to be contradicted  His bright proud eye\\nspoke the conviction that he was nice and Anne Elliot was\\nnot out of his thoughts when he more seriously described\\nthe woman he should wish to meet with  A strong mind\\nwith sweetness of manner made the first and the last of the description\\n\\nThat is the woman I want said he  Something a little inferior\\nI shall of course put up with but it must not be much  If I am a fool\\nI shall be a fool indeed for I have thought on the subject\\nmore than most men\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 8\\n\\n\\nFrom this time Captain Wentworth and Anne Elliot were repeatedly\\nin the same circle  They were soon dining in company together\\nat Mr Musgroves for the little boys state could no longer\\nsupply his aunt with a pretence for absenting herself and this was\\nbut the beginning of other dinings and other meetings\\n\\nWhether former feelings were to be renewed must be brought to the proof\\nformer times must undoubtedly be brought to the recollection of each\\nthey could not but be reverted to the year of their engagement\\ncould not but be named by him in the little narratives or descriptions\\nwhich conversation called forth  His profession qualified him\\nhis disposition lead him to talk and That was in the year six\\nThat happened before I went to sea in the year six occurred\\nin the course of the first evening they spent together\\nand though his voice did not falter and though she had no reason\\nto suppose his eye wandering towards her while he spoke\\nAnne felt the utter impossibility from her knowledge of his mind\\nthat he could be unvisited by remembrance any more than herself\\nThere must be the same immediate association of thought\\nthough she was very far from conceiving it to be of equal pain\\n\\nThey had no conversation together no intercourse but what\\nthe commonest civility required  Once so much to each other\\nNow nothing  There had been a time when of all the large party\\nnow filling the drawingroom at Uppercross they would have found it\\nmost difficult to cease to speak to one another  With the exception\\nperhaps of Admiral and Mrs Croft who seemed particularly attached\\nand happy Anne could allow no other exceptions even among\\nthe married couples there could have been no two hearts so open\\nno tastes so similar no feelings so in unison no countenances so beloved\\nNow they were as strangers nay worse than strangers for they could\\nnever become acquainted  It was a perpetual estrangement\\n\\nWhen he talked she heard the same voice and discerned the same mind\\nThere was a very general ignorance of all naval matters throughout the party\\nand he was very much questioned and especially by the two Miss Musgroves\\nwho seemed hardly to have any eyes but for him as to the manner\\nof living on board daily regulations food hours c and their surprise\\nat his accounts at learning the degree of accommodation and arrangement\\nwhich was practicable drew from him some pleasant ridicule\\nwhich reminded Anne of the early days when she too had been ignorant\\nand she too had been accused of supposing sailors to be living on board\\nwithout anything to eat or any cook to dress it if there were\\nor any servant to wait or any knife and fork to use\\n\\nFrom thus listening and thinking she was roused by a whisper\\nof Mrs Musgroves who overcome by fond regrets could not help saying\\n\\nAh Miss Anne if it had pleased Heaven to spare my poor son\\nI dare say he would have been just such another by this time\\n\\nAnne suppressed a smile and listened kindly while Mrs Musgrove\\nrelieved her heart a little more and for a few minutes therefore\\ncould not keep pace with the conversation of the others\\n\\nWhen she could let her attention take its natural course again\\nshe found the Miss Musgroves just fetching the Navy List\\ntheir own navy list the first that had ever been at Uppercross\\nand sitting down together to pore over it with the professed view\\nof finding out the ships that Captain Wentworth had commanded\\n\\nYour first was the Asp I remember we will look for the Asp\\n\\nYou will not find her there  Quite worn out and broken up\\nI was the last man who commanded her  Hardly fit for service then\\nReported fit for home service for a year or two and so I was sent off\\nto the West Indies\\n\\nThe girls looked all amazement\\n\\nThe Admiralty he continued entertain themselves now and then\\nwith sending a few hundred men to sea in a ship not fit to be employed\\nBut they have a great many to provide for and among the thousands\\nthat may just as well go to the bottom as not it is impossible\\nfor them to distinguish the very set who may be least missed\\n\\nPhoo phoo cried the Admiral what stuff these young fellows talk\\nNever was a better sloop than the Asp in her day  For an old built sloop\\nyou would not see her equal  Lucky fellow to get her  He knows there\\nmust have been twenty better men than himself applying for her\\nat the same time  Lucky fellow to get anything so soon\\nwith no more interest than his\\n\\nI felt my luck Admiral I assure you replied Captain Wentworth\\nseriously  I was as well satisfied with my appointment as you can desire\\nIt was a great object with me at that time to be at sea\\na very great object I wanted to be doing something\\n\\nTo be sure you did  What should a young fellow like you do ashore\\nfor half a year together  If a man had not a wife he soon wants\\nto be afloat again\\n\\nBut Captain Wentworth cried Louisa how vexed you must have been\\nwhen you came to the Asp to see what an old thing they had given you\\n\\nI knew pretty well what she was before that day said he smiling\\nI had no more discoveries to make than you would have as to\\nthe fashion and strength of any old pelisse which you had seen\\nlent about among half your acquaintance ever since you could remember\\nand which at last on some very wet day is lent to yourself\\nAh she was a dear old Asp to me  She did all that I wanted\\nI knew she would  I knew that we should either go to the bottom together\\nor that she would be the making of me and I never had two days\\nof foul weather all the time I was at sea in her and after\\ntaking privateers enough to be very entertaining I had the good luck\\nin my passage home the next autumn to fall in with the very French frigate\\nI wanted  I brought her into Plymouth and here another instance of luck\\nWe had not been six hours in the Sound when a gale came on\\nwhich lasted four days and nights and which would have done for\\npoor old Asp in half the time our touch with the Great Nation\\nnot having much improved our condition  Fourandtwenty hours later\\nand I should only have been a gallant Captain Wentworth\\nin a small paragraph at one corner of the newspapers and being lost\\nin only a sloop nobody would have thought about me Annes shudderings\\nwere to herself alone but the Miss Musgroves could be as open\\nas they were sincere in their exclamations of pity and horror\\n\\nAnd so then I suppose said Mrs Musgrove in a low voice\\nas if thinking aloud so then he went away to the Laconia and there\\nhe met with our poor boy Charles my dear beckoning him to her\\ndo ask Captain Wentworth where it was he first met with your poor brother\\nI always forgot\\n\\nIt was at Gibraltar mother I know  Dick had been left ill at Gibraltar\\nwith a recommendation from his former captain to Captain Wentworth\\n\\nOh but Charles tell Captain Wentworth he need not be afraid\\nof mentioning poor Dick before me for it would be rather a pleasure\\nto hear him talked of by such a good friend\\n\\nCharles being somewhat more mindful of the probabilities of the case\\nonly nodded in reply and walked away\\n\\nThe girls were now hunting for the Laconia and Captain Wentworth\\ncould not deny himself the pleasure of taking the precious volume\\ninto his own hands to save them the trouble and once more read aloud\\nthe little statement of her name and rate and present\\nnoncommissioned class observing over it that she too had been\\none of the best friends man ever had\\n\\nAh those were pleasant days when I had the Laconia  How fast I\\nmade money in her  A friend of mine and I had such a lovely cruise\\ntogether off the Western Islands  Poor Harville sister\\nYou know how much he wanted money  worse than myself  He had a wife\\nExcellent fellow  I shall never forget his happiness  He felt it all\\nso much for her sake  I wished for him again the next summer\\nwhen I had still the same luck in the Mediterranean\\n\\nAnd I am sure Sir said Mrs Musgrove it was a lucky day for us\\nwhen you were put captain into that ship  We shall never forget\\nwhat you did\\n\\nHer feelings made her speak low and Captain Wentworth\\nhearing only in part and probably not having Dick Musgrove at all\\nnear his thoughts looked rather in suspense and as if waiting for more\\n\\nMy brother whispered one of the girls mamma is thinking\\nof poor Richard\\n\\nPoor dear fellow continued Mrs Musgrove he was grown so steady\\nand such an excellent correspondent while he was under your care\\nAh it would have been a happy thing if he had never left you\\nI assure you Captain Wentworth we are very sorry he ever left you\\n\\nThere was a momentary expression in Captain Wentworths face at this speech\\na certain glance of his bright eye and curl of his handsome mouth\\nwhich convinced Anne that instead of sharing in Mrs Musgroves kind wishes\\nas to her son he had probably been at some pains to get rid of him\\nbut it was too transient an indulgence of selfamusement to be detected\\nby any who understood him less than herself in another moment\\nhe was perfectly collected and serious and almost instantly afterwards\\ncoming up to the sofa on which she and Mrs Musgrove were sitting\\ntook a place by the latter and entered into conversation with her\\nin a low voice about her son doing it with so much sympathy\\nand natural grace as shewed the kindest consideration for all\\nthat was real and unabsurd in the parents feelings\\n\\nThey were actually on the same sofa for Mrs Musgrove had\\nmost readily made room for him they were divided only by Mrs Musgrove\\nIt was no insignificant barrier indeed  Mrs Musgrove was of\\na comfortable substantial size infinitely more fitted by nature\\nto express good cheer and good humour than tenderness and sentiment\\nand while the agitations of Annes slender form and pensive face\\nmay be considered as very completely screened Captain Wentworth\\nshould be allowed some credit for the selfcommand with which\\nhe attended to her large fat sighings over the destiny of a son\\nwhom alive nobody had cared for\\n\\nPersonal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary proportions\\nA large bulky figure has as good a right to be in deep affliction\\nas the most graceful set of limbs in the world  But fair or not fair\\nthere are unbecoming conjunctions which reason will patronize in vain\\nwhich taste cannot toleratewhich ridicule will seize\\n\\nThe Admiral after taking two or three refreshing turns about the room\\nwith his hands behind him being called to order by his wife\\nnow came up to Captain Wentworth and without any observation\\nof what he might be interrupting thinking only of his own thoughts\\nbegan with\\n\\nIf you had been a week later at Lisbon last spring Frederick\\nyou would have been asked to give a passage to Lady Mary Grierson\\nand her daughters\\n\\nShould I  I am glad I was not a week later then\\n\\nThe Admiral abused him for his want of gallantry  He defended himself\\nthough professing that he would never willingly admit any ladies\\non board a ship of his excepting for a ball or a visit\\nwhich a few hours might comprehend\\n\\nBut if I know myself said he this is from no want of gallantry\\ntowards them  It is rather from feeling how impossible it is\\nwith all ones efforts and all ones sacrifices to make\\nthe accommodations on board such as women ought to have\\nThere can be no want of gallantry Admiral in rating the claims of women\\nto every personal comfort high and this is what I do  I hate to hear\\nof women on board or to see them on board and no ship under my command\\nshall ever convey a family of ladies anywhere if I can help it\\n\\nThis brought his sister upon him\\n\\nOh Frederick  But I cannot believe it of you All idle refinement\\nWomen may be as comfortable on board as in the best house in England\\nI believe I have lived as much on board as most women and I know\\nnothing superior to the accommodations of a manofwar  I declare\\nI have not a comfort or an indulgence about me even at Kellynch Hall\\nwith a kind bow to Anne beyond what I always had in most of\\nthe ships I have lived in and they have been five altogether\\n\\nNothing to the purpose replied her brother  You were living\\nwith your husband and were the only woman on board\\n\\nBut you yourself brought Mrs Harville her sister her cousin\\nand three children round from Portsmouth to Plymouth  Where was this\\nsuperfine extraordinary sort of gallantry of yours then\\n\\nAll merged in my friendship Sophia  I would assist any\\nbrother officers wife that I could and I would bring anything\\nof Harvilles from the worlds end if he wanted it  But do not imagine\\nthat I did not feel it an evil in itself\\n\\nDepend upon it they were all perfectly comfortable\\n\\nI might not like them the better for that perhaps  Such a number\\nof women and children have no right to be comfortable on board\\n\\nMy dear Frederick you are talking quite idly  Pray what would\\nbecome of us poor sailors wives who often want to be conveyed to\\none port or another after our husbands if everybody had your feelings\\n\\nMy feelings you see did not prevent my taking Mrs Harville\\nand all her family to Plymouth\\n\\nBut I hate to hear you talking so like a fine gentleman\\nand as if women were all fine ladies instead of rational creatures\\nWe none of us expect to be in smooth water all our days\\n\\nAh my dear said the Admiral when he had got a wife\\nhe will sing a different tune  When he is married if we have\\nthe good luck to live to another war we shall see him do as you and I\\nand a great many others have done  We shall have him very thankful\\nto anybody that will bring him his wife\\n\\nAy that we shall\\n\\nNow I have done cried Captain Wentworth  When once married\\npeople begin to attack me withOh you will think very differently\\nwhen you are married  I can only say No I shall not and then\\nthey say again Yes you will and there is an end of it\\n\\nHe got up and moved away\\n\\nWhat a great traveller you must have been maam said Mrs Musgrove\\nto Mrs Croft\\n\\nPretty well maam in the fifteen years of my marriage\\nthough many women have done more  I have crossed the Atlantic\\nfour times and have been once to the East Indies and back again\\nand only once besides being in different places about home\\nCork and Lisbon and Gibraltar  But I never went beyond the Streights\\nand never was in the West Indies  We do not call Bermuda or Bahama\\nyou know the West Indies\\n\\nMrs Musgrove had not a word to say in dissent she could not accuse herself\\nof having ever called them anything in the whole course of her life\\n\\nAnd I do assure you maam pursued Mrs Croft that nothing can exceed\\nthe accommodations of a manofwar I speak you know of the higher rates\\nWhen you come to a frigate of course you are more confined\\nthough any reasonable woman may be perfectly happy in one of them\\nand I can safely say that the happiest part of my life has been spent\\non board a ship  While we were together you know there was nothing\\nto be feared  Thank God  I have always been blessed with\\nexcellent health and no climate disagrees with me  A little disordered\\nalways the first twentyfour hours of going to sea but never knew\\nwhat sickness was afterwards  The only time I ever really suffered\\nin body or mind the only time that I ever fancied myself unwell\\nor had any ideas of danger was the winter that I passed by myself at Deal\\nwhen the Admiral Captain Croft then was in the North Seas\\nI lived in perpetual fright at that time and had all manner of\\nimaginary complaints from not knowing what to do with myself\\nor when I should hear from him next but as long as we could be together\\nnothing ever ailed me and I never met with the smallest inconvenience\\n\\nAye to be sure  Yes indeed oh yes  I am quite of your opinion\\nMrs Croft was Mrs Musgroves hearty answer  There is nothing so bad\\nas a separation  I am quite of your opinion  I know what it is\\nfor Mr Musgrove always attends the assizes and I am so glad when\\nthey are over and he is safe back again\\n\\nThe evening ended with dancing  On its being proposed\\nAnne offered her services as usual and though her eyes would sometimes\\nfill with tears as she sat at the instrument she was extremely glad\\nto be employed and desired nothing in return but to be unobserved\\n\\nIt was a merry joyous party and no one seemed in higher spirits\\nthan Captain Wentworth  She felt that he had every thing to elevate\\nhim which general attention and deference and especially the attention\\nof all the young women could do  The Miss Hayters the females\\nof the family of cousins already mentioned were apparently admitted\\nto the honour of being in love with him and as for Henrietta and Louisa\\nthey both seemed so entirely occupied by him that nothing but\\nthe continued appearance of the most perfect goodwill between themselves\\ncould have made it credible that they were not decided rivals\\nIf he were a little spoilt by such universal such eager admiration\\nwho could wonder\\n\\nThese were some of the thoughts which occupied Anne while her fingers\\nwere mechanically at work proceeding for half an hour together\\nequally without error and without consciousness  Once she felt\\nthat he was looking at herself  observing her altered features\\nperhaps trying to trace in them the ruins of the face which had once\\ncharmed him and once she knew that he must have spoken of her\\nshe was hardly aware of it till she heard the answer but then she was\\nsure of his having asked his partner whether Miss Elliot never danced\\nThe answer was Oh no never she has quite given up dancing\\nShe had rather play  She is never tired of playing  Once too\\nhe spoke to her  She had left the instrument on the dancing being over\\nand he had sat down to try to make out an air which he wished\\nto give the Miss Musgroves an idea of  Unintentionally she returned\\nto that part of the room he saw her and instantly rising\\nsaid with studied politeness\\n\\nI beg your pardon madam this is your seat and though she immediately\\ndrew back with a decided negative he was not to be induced\\nto sit down again\\n\\nAnne did not wish for more of such looks and speeches\\nHis cold politeness his ceremonious grace were worse than anything\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 9\\n\\n\\nCaptain Wentworth was come to Kellynch as to a home to stay\\nas long as he liked being as thoroughly the object of\\nthe Admirals fraternal kindness as of his wifes  He had intended\\non first arriving to proceed very soon into Shropshire\\nand visit the brother settled in that country but the attractions\\nof Uppercross induced him to put this off  There was so much\\nof friendliness and of flattery and of everything most bewitching\\nin his reception there the old were so hospitable the young so agreeable\\nthat he could not but resolve to remain where he was and take all\\nthe charms and perfections of Edwards wife upon credit a little longer\\n\\nIt was soon Uppercross with him almost every day  The Musgroves\\ncould hardly be more ready to invite than he to come particularly\\nin the morning when he had no companion at home for the Admiral\\nand Mrs Croft were generally out of doors together interesting themselves\\nin their new possessions their grass and their sheep and dawdling about\\nin a way not endurable to a third person or driving out in a gig\\nlately added to their establishment\\n\\nHitherto there had been but one opinion of Captain Wentworth\\namong the Musgroves and their dependencies  It was unvarying\\nwarm admiration everywhere but this intimate footing was not more\\nthan established when a certain Charles Hayter returned among them\\nto be a good deal disturbed by it and to think Captain Wentworth\\nvery much in the way\\n\\nCharles Hayter was the eldest of all the cousins and a very amiable\\npleasing young man between whom and Henrietta there had been\\na considerable appearance of attachment previous to Captain Wentworths\\nintroduction  He was in orders and having a curacy in the neighbourhood\\nwhere residence was not required lived at his fathers house\\nonly two miles from Uppercross  A short absence from home\\nhad left his fair one unguarded by his attentions at this critical period\\nand when he came back he had the pain of finding very altered manners\\nand of seeing Captain Wentworth\\n\\nMrs Musgrove and Mrs Hayter were sisters  They had each had money\\nbut their marriages had made a material difference in\\ntheir degree of consequence  Mr Hayter had some property of his own\\nbut it was insignificant compared with Mr Musgroves and while\\nthe Musgroves were in the first class of society in the country\\nthe young Hayters would from their parents inferior retired\\nand unpolished way of living and their own defective education\\nhave been hardly in any class at all but for their connexion\\nwith Uppercross this eldest son of course excepted who had chosen\\nto be a scholar and a gentleman and who was very superior\\nin cultivation and manners to all the rest\\n\\nThe two families had always been on excellent terms there being no pride\\non one side and no envy on the other and only such a consciousness\\nof superiority in the Miss Musgroves as made them pleased\\nto improve their cousins  Charless attentions to Henrietta\\nhad been observed by her father and mother without any disapprobation\\nIt would not be a great match for her but if Henrietta liked him\\nand Henrietta did seem to like him\\n\\nHenrietta fully thought so herself before Captain Wentworth came\\nbut from that time Cousin Charles had been very much forgotten\\n\\nWhich of the two sisters was preferred by Captain Wentworth was\\nas yet quite doubtful as far as Annes observation reached\\nHenrietta was perhaps the prettiest Louisa had the higher spirits\\nand she knew not now whether the more gentle or the more lively character\\nwere most likely to attract him\\n\\nMr and Mrs Musgrove either from seeing little or from\\nan entire confidence in the discretion of both their daughters\\nand of all the young men who came near them seemed to leave everything\\nto take its chance  There was not the smallest appearance of solicitude\\nor remark about them in the Mansionhouse but it was different\\nat the Cottage  the young couple there were more disposed\\nto speculate and wonder and Captain Wentworth had not been above\\nfour or five times in the Miss Musgroves company and Charles Hayter\\nhad but just reappeared when Anne had to listen to the opinions\\nof her brother and sister as to which was the one liked best\\nCharles gave it for Louisa Mary for Henrietta but quite agreeing\\nthat to have him marry either could be extremely delightful\\n\\nCharles had never seen a pleasanter man in his life and from what\\nhe had once heard Captain Wentworth himself say was very sure that\\nhe had not made less than twenty thousand pounds by the war\\nHere was a fortune at once besides which there would be the chance\\nof what might be done in any future war and he was sure Captain Wentworth\\nwas as likely a man to distinguish himself as any officer in the navy\\nOh it would be a capital match for either of his sisters\\n\\nUpon my word it would replied Mary  Dear me  If he should\\nrise to any very great honours  If he should ever be made a baronet\\nLady Wentworth sounds very well  That would be a noble thing\\nindeed for Henrietta  She would take place of me then and Henrietta\\nwould not dislike that  Sir Frederick and Lady Wentworth\\nIt would be but a new creation however and I never think much\\nof your new creations\\n\\nIt suited Mary best to think Henrietta the one preferred\\non the very account of Charles Hayter whose pretensions she wished\\nto see put an end to  She looked down very decidedly upon the Hayters\\nand thought it would be quite a misfortune to have the existing connection\\nbetween the families renewedvery sad for herself and her children\\n\\nYou know said she I cannot think him at all a fit match for Henrietta\\nand considering the alliances which the Musgroves have made\\nshe has no right to throw herself away  I do not think any young woman\\nhas a right to make a choice that may be disagreeable and inconvenient\\nto the principal part of her family and be giving bad connections\\nto those who have not been used to them  And pray who is Charles Hayter\\nNothing but a country curate  A most improper match for Miss Musgrove\\nof Uppercross\\n\\nHer husband however would not agree with her here for besides having\\na regard for his cousin Charles Hayter was an eldest son\\nand he saw things as an eldest son himself\\n\\nNow you are taking nonsense Mary was therefore his answer\\nIt would not be a great match for Henrietta but Charles has\\na very fair chance through the Spicers of getting something from\\nthe Bishop in the course of a year or two and you will please to remember\\nthat he is the eldest son whenever my uncle dies he steps into very\\npretty property  The estate at Winthrop is not less than\\ntwo hundred and fifty acres besides the farm near Taunton\\nwhich is some of the best land in the country  I grant you\\nthat any of them but Charles would be a very shocking match for Henrietta\\nand indeed it could not be he is the only one that could be possible\\nbut he is a very goodnatured good sort of a fellow and whenever Winthrop\\ncomes into his hands he will make a different sort of place of it\\nand live in a very different sort of way and with that property\\nhe will never be a contemptible mangood freehold property  No no\\nHenrietta might do worse than marry Charles Hayter and if she has him\\nand Louisa can get Captain Wentworth I shall be very well satisfied\\n\\nCharles may say what he pleases cried Mary to Anne as soon as\\nhe was out of the room but it would be shocking to have Henrietta\\nmarry Charles Hayter a very bad thing for her and still worse\\nfor me and therefore it is very much to be wished that Captain Wentworth\\nmay soon put him quite out of her head and I have very little doubt\\nthat he has  She took hardly any notice of Charles Hayter yesterday\\nI wish you had been there to see her behaviour  And as to\\nCaptain Wentworths liking Louisa as well as Henrietta it is nonsense\\nto say so for he certainly does like Henrietta a great deal the best\\nBut Charles is so positive  I wish you had been with us yesterday\\nfor then you might have decided between us and I am sure you\\nwould have thought as I did unless you had been determined\\nto give it against me\\n\\nA dinner at Mr Musgroves had been the occasion when all these things\\nshould have been seen by Anne but she had staid at home\\nunder the mixed plea of a headache of her own and some return\\nof indisposition in little Charles  She had thought only of avoiding\\nCaptain Wentworth but an escape from being appealed to as umpire\\nwas now added to the advantages of a quiet evening\\n\\nAs to Captain Wentworths views she deemed it of more consequence\\nthat he should know his own mind early enough not to be endangering\\nthe happiness of either sister or impeaching his own honour\\nthan that he should prefer Henrietta to Louisa or Louisa to Henrietta\\nEither of them would in all probability make him an affectionate\\ngoodhumoured wife  With regard to Charles Hayter she had delicacy\\nwhich must be pained by any lightness of conduct in a wellmeaning\\nyoung woman and a heart to sympathize in any of the sufferings\\nit occasioned but if Henrietta found herself mistaken in the nature\\nof her feelings the alternation could not be understood too soon\\n\\nCharles Hayter had met with much to disquiet and mortify him\\nin his cousins behaviour  She had too old a regard for him\\nto be so wholly estranged as might in two meetings extinguish\\nevery past hope and leave him nothing to do but to keep away\\nfrom Uppercross  but there was such a change as became very alarming\\nwhen such a man as Captain Wentworth was to be regarded as\\nthe probable cause  He had been absent only two Sundays\\nand when they parted had left her interested even to the height\\nof his wishes in his prospect of soon quitting his present curacy\\nand obtaining that of Uppercross instead  It had then seemed the object\\nnearest her heart that Dr Shirley the rector who for more than\\nforty years had been zealously discharging all the duties of his office\\nbut was now growing too infirm for many of them should be quite fixed\\non engaging a curate should make his curacy quite as good\\nas he could afford and should give Charles Hayter the promise of it\\nThe advantage of his having to come only to Uppercross instead of going\\nsix miles another way of his having in every respect a better curacy\\nof his belonging to their dear Dr Shirley and of dear good Dr Shirleys\\nbeing relieved from the duty which he could no longer get through\\nwithout most injurious fatigue had been a great deal even to Louisa\\nbut had been almost everything to Henrietta  When he came back alas\\nthe zeal of the business was gone by  Louisa could not listen at all\\nto his account of a conversation which he had just held with Dr Shirley\\nshe was at a window looking out for Captain Wentworth and even Henrietta\\nhad at best only a divided attention to give and seemed to have forgotten\\nall the former doubt and solicitude of the negotiation\\n\\nWell I am very glad indeed  but I always thought you would have it\\nI always thought you sure  It did not appear to me thatin short\\nyou know Dr Shirley must have a curate and you had secured his promise\\nIs he coming Louisa\\n\\nOne morning very soon after the dinner at the Musgroves\\nat which Anne had not been present Captain Wentworth walked into\\nthe drawingroom at the Cottage where were only herself and the little\\ninvalid Charles who was lying on the sofa\\n\\nThe surprise of finding himself almost alone with Anne Elliot\\ndeprived his manners of their usual composure  he started\\nand could only say I thought the Miss Musgroves had been here\\nMrs Musgrove told me I should find them here before he walked\\nto the window to recollect himself and feel how he ought to behave\\n\\nThey are up stairs with my sister  they will be down in a few moments\\nI dare say had been Annes reply in all the confusion that was natural\\nand if the child had not called her to come and do something for him\\nshe would have been out of the room the next moment and released\\nCaptain Wentworth as well as herself\\n\\nHe continued at the window and after calmly and politely saying\\nI hope the little boy is better was silent\\n\\nShe was obliged to kneel down by the sofa and remain there\\nto satisfy her patient and thus they continued a few minutes\\nwhen to her very great satisfaction she heard some other person\\ncrossing the little vestibule  She hoped on turning her head\\nto see the master of the house but it proved to be one\\nmuch less calculated for making matters easyCharles Hayter\\nprobably not at all better pleased by the sight of Captain Wentworth\\nthan Captain Wentworth had been by the sight of Anne\\n\\nShe only attempted to say How do you do  Will you not sit down\\nThe others will be here presently\\n\\nCaptain Wentworth however came from his window apparently\\nnot illdisposed for conversation but Charles Hayter soon put an end\\nto his attempts by seating himself near the table and taking up\\nthe newspaper and Captain Wentworth returned to his window\\n\\nAnother minute brought another addition  The younger boy\\na remarkable stout forward child of two years old having got the door\\nopened for him by some one without made his determined appearance\\namong them and went straight to the sofa to see what was going on\\nand put in his claim to anything good that might be giving away\\n\\nThere being nothing to eat he could only have some play\\nand as his aunt would not let him tease his sick brother\\nhe began to fasten himself upon her as she knelt in such a way that\\nbusy as she was about Charles she could not shake him off\\nShe spoke to him ordered entreated and insisted in vain\\nOnce she did contrive to push him away but the boy had\\nthe greater pleasure in getting upon her back again directly\\n\\nWalter said she get down this moment  You are extremely troublesome\\nI am very angry with you\\n\\nWalter cried Charles Hayter why do you not do as you are bid\\nDo not you hear your aunt speak  Come to me Walter come to\\ncousin Charles\\n\\nBut not a bit did Walter stir\\n\\nIn another moment however she found herself in the state of\\nbeing released from him some one was taking him from her\\nthough he had bent down her head so much that his little sturdy hands\\nwere unfastened from around her neck and he was resolutely borne away\\nbefore she knew that Captain Wentworth had done it\\n\\nHer sensations on the discovery made her perfectly speechless\\nShe could not even thank him  She could only hang over little Charles\\nwith most disordered feelings  His kindness in stepping forward\\nto her relief the manner the silence in which it had passed\\nthe little particulars of the circumstance with the conviction soon\\nforced on her by the noise he was studiously making with the child\\nthat he meant to avoid hearing her thanks and rather sought\\nto testify that her conversation was the last of his wants\\nproduced such a confusion of varying but very painful agitation\\nas she could not recover from till enabled by the entrance of Mary\\nand the Miss Musgroves to make over her little patient to their cares\\nand leave the room  She could not stay  It might have been\\nan opportunity of watching the loves and jealousies of the four\\nthey were now altogether but she could stay for none of it\\nIt was evident that Charles Hayter was not well inclined towards\\nCaptain Wentworth  She had a strong impression of his having said\\nin a vext tone of voice after Captain Wentworths interference\\nYou ought to have minded me Walter I told you not to teaze your aunt\\nand could comprehend his regretting that Captain Wentworth should do\\nwhat he ought to have done himself  But neither Charles Hayters feelings\\nnor anybodys feelings could interest her till she had a little better\\narranged her own  She was ashamed of herself quite ashamed\\nof being so nervous so overcome by such a trifle but so it was\\nand it required a long application of solitude and reflection\\nto recover her\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 10\\n\\n\\nOther opportunities of making her observations could not fail to occur\\nAnne had soon been in company with all the four together often enough\\nto have an opinion though too wise to acknowledge as much at home\\nwhere she knew it would have satisfied neither husband nor wife\\nfor while she considered Louisa to be rather the favourite\\nshe could not but think as far as she might dare to judge from memory\\nand experience that Captain Wentworth was not in love with either\\nThey were more in love with him yet there it was not love\\nIt was a little fever of admiration but it might probably must\\nend in love with some  Charles Hayter seemed aware of being slighted\\nand yet Henrietta had sometimes the air of being divided between them\\nAnne longed for the power of representing to them all what they were about\\nand of pointing out some of the evils they were exposing themselves to\\nShe did not attribute guile to any  It was the highest satisfaction\\nto her to believe Captain Wentworth not in the least aware\\nof the pain he was occasioning  There was no triumph no pitiful triumph\\nin his manner  He had probably never heard and never thought of\\nany claims of Charles Hayter  He was only wrong in accepting\\nthe attentions for accepting must be the word of two young women at once\\n\\nAfter a short struggle however Charles Hayter seemed to quit the field\\nThree days had passed without his coming once to Uppercross\\na most decided change  He had even refused one regular invitation to dinner\\nand having been found on the occasion by Mr Musgrove with some large books\\nbefore him Mr and Mrs Musgrove were sure all could not be right\\nand talked with grave faces of his studying himself to death\\nIt was Marys hope and belief that he had received a positive dismissal\\nfrom Henrietta and her husband lived under the constant dependence\\nof seeing him tomorrow  Anne could only feel that Charles Hayter\\nwas wise\\n\\nOne morning about this time Charles Musgrove and Captain Wentworth\\nbeing gone ashooting together as the sisters in the Cottage\\nwere sitting quietly at work they were visited at the window\\nby the sisters from the Mansionhouse\\n\\nIt was a very fine November day and the Miss Musgroves came\\nthrough the little grounds and stopped for no other purpose than to say\\nthat they were going to take a long walk and therefore concluded\\nMary could not like to go with them and when Mary immediately replied\\nwith some jealousy at not being supposed a good walker Oh yes\\nI should like to join you very much I am very fond of a long walk\\nAnne felt persuaded by the looks of the two girls that it was precisely\\nwhat they did not wish and admired again the sort of necessity\\nwhich the family habits seemed to produce of everything being\\nto be communicated and everything being to be done together\\nhowever undesired and inconvenient  She tried to dissuade Mary from going\\nbut in vain and that being the case thought it best to accept\\nthe Miss Musgroves much more cordial invitation to herself to go likewise\\nas she might be useful in turning back with her sister and lessening\\nthe interference in any plan of their own\\n\\nI cannot imagine why they should suppose I should not like a long walk\\nsaid Mary as she went up stairs  Everybody is always supposing\\nthat I am not a good walker and yet they would not have been pleased\\nif we had refused to join them  When people come in this manner\\non purpose to ask us how can one say no\\n\\nJust as they were setting off the gentlemen returned  They had taken out\\na young dog who had spoilt their sport and sent them back early\\nTheir time and strength and spirits were therefore exactly ready\\nfor this walk and they entered into it with pleasure  Could Anne\\nhave foreseen such a junction she would have staid at home but\\nfrom some feelings of interest and curiosity she fancied now that it was\\ntoo late to retract and the whole six set forward together\\nin the direction chosen by the Miss Musgroves who evidently\\nconsidered the walk as under their guidance\\n\\nAnnes object was not to be in the way of anybody and where\\nthe narrow paths across the fields made many separations necessary\\nto keep with her brother and sister  Her pleasure in the walk\\nmust arise from the exercise and the day from the view of\\nthe last smiles of the year upon the tawny leaves and withered hedges\\nand from repeating to herself some few of the thousand poetical\\ndescriptions extant of autumn that season of peculiar and\\ninexhaustible influence on the mind of taste and tenderness\\nthat season which had drawn from every poet worthy of being read\\nsome attempt at description or some lines of feeling\\nShe occupied her mind as much as possible in such like musings\\nand quotations but it was not possible that when within reach\\nof Captain Wentworths conversation with either of the Miss Musgroves\\nshe should not try to hear it yet she caught little very remarkable\\nIt was mere lively chat such as any young persons on an intimate footing\\nmight fall into  He was more engaged with Louisa than with Henrietta\\nLouisa certainly put more forward for his notice than her sister\\nThis distinction appeared to increase and there was one speech\\nof Louisas which struck her  After one of the many praises of the day\\nwhich were continually bursting forth Captain Wentworth added \\n\\nWhat glorious weather for the Admiral and my sister  They meant to take\\na long drive this morning perhaps we may hail them from\\nsome of these hills  They talked of coming into this side of the country\\nI wonder whereabouts they will upset today  Oh it does happen\\nvery often I assure you but my sister makes nothing of it\\nshe would as lieve be tossed out as not\\n\\nAh You make the most of it I know cried Louisa but if it were\\nreally so I should do just the same in her place  If I loved a man\\nas she loves the Admiral I would always be with him nothing should ever\\nseparate us and I would rather be overturned by him than driven safely\\nby anybody else\\n\\nIt was spoken with enthusiasm\\n\\nHad you cried he catching the same tone I honour you\\nAnd there was silence between them for a little while\\n\\nAnne could not immediately fall into a quotation again  The sweet scenes\\nof autumn were for a while put by unless some tender sonnet\\nfraught with the apt analogy of the declining year with declining\\nhappiness and the images of youth and hope and spring all gone together\\nblessed her memory  She roused herself to say as they struck by order\\ninto another path Is not this one of the ways to Winthrop\\nBut nobody heard or at least nobody answered her\\n\\nWinthrop however or its environsfor young men are sometimes\\nto be met with strolling about near homewas their destination\\nand after another half mile of gradual ascent through large enclosures\\nwhere the ploughs at work and the fresh made path spoke the farmer\\ncounteracting the sweets of poetical despondence and meaning\\nto have spring again they gained the summit of the most considerable hill\\nwhich parted Uppercross and Winthrop and soon commanded a full view\\nof the latter at the foot of the hill on the other side\\n\\nWinthrop without beauty and without dignity was stretched before them\\nan indifferent house standing low and hemmed in by the barns and\\nbuildings of a farmyard\\n\\nMary exclaimed Bless me here is Winthrop  I declare I had no idea\\nWell now I think we had better turn back I am excessively tired\\n\\nHenrietta conscious and ashamed and seeing no cousin Charles\\nwalking along any path or leaning against any gate was ready\\nto do as Mary wished but No said Charles Musgrove and No no\\ncried Louisa more eagerly and taking her sister aside seemed to be\\narguing the matter warmly\\n\\nCharles in the meanwhile was very decidedly declaring his resolution\\nof calling on his aunt now that he was so near and very evidently\\nthough more fearfully trying to induce his wife to go too\\nBut this was one of the points on which the lady shewed her strength\\nand when he recommended the advantage of resting herself a quarter\\nof an hour at Winthrop as she felt so tired she resolutely answered\\nOh no indeed walking up that hill again would do her more harm\\nthan any sitting down could do her good and in short\\nher look and manner declared that go she would not\\n\\nAfter a little succession of these sort of debates and consultations\\nit was settled between Charles and his two sisters that he\\nand Henrietta should just run down for a few minutes to see their aunt\\nand cousins while the rest of the party waited for them at the top\\nof the hill  Louisa seemed the principal arranger of the plan\\nand as she went a little way with them down the hill still talking\\nto Henrietta Mary took the opportunity of looking scornfully around her\\nand saying to Captain Wentworth\\n\\nIt is very unpleasant having such connexions  But I assure you\\nI have never been in the house above twice in my life\\n\\nShe received no other answer than an artificial assenting smile\\nfollowed by a contemptuous glance as he turned away which Anne\\nperfectly knew the meaning of\\n\\nThe brow of the hill where they remained was a cheerful spot\\nLouisa returned and Mary finding a comfortable seat for herself\\non the step of a stile was very well satisfied so long as the others\\nall stood about her but when Louisa drew Captain Wentworth away\\nto try for a gleaning of nuts in an adjoining hedgerow\\nand they were gone by degrees quite out of sight and sound\\nMary was happy no longer she quarrelled with her own seat\\nwas sure Louisa had got a much better somewhere and nothing could\\nprevent her from going to look for a better also  She turned through\\nthe same gate but could not see them  Anne found a nice seat\\nfor her on a dry sunny bank under the hedgerow in which\\nshe had no doubt of their still being in some spot or other\\nMary sat down for a moment but it would not do she was sure Louisa\\nhad found a better seat somewhere else and she would go on\\ntill she overtook her\\n\\nAnne really tired herself was glad to sit down and she very soon heard\\nCaptain Wentworth and Louisa in the hedgerow behind her as if\\nmaking their way back along the rough wild sort of channel down the\\ncentre  They were speaking as they drew near  Louisas voice was\\nthe first distinguished  She seemed to be in the middle of some\\neager speech  What Anne first heard was\\n\\nAnd so I made her go  I could not bear that she should be frightened\\nfrom the visit by such nonsense  What would I be turned back from\\ndoing a thing that I had determined to do and that I knew to be right\\nby the airs and interference of such a person or of any person I may say\\nNo I have no idea of being so easily persuaded  When I have\\nmade up my mind I have made it and Henrietta seemed entirely\\nto have made up hers to call at Winthrop today and yet she was as near\\ngiving it up out of nonsensical complaisance\\n\\nShe would have turned back then but for you\\n\\nShe would indeed  I am almost ashamed to say it\\n\\nHappy for her to have such a mind as yours at hand  After the hints\\nyou gave just now which did but confirm my own observations\\nthe last time I was in company with him  I need not affect\\nto have no comprehension of what is going on  I see that more than\\na mere dutiful morning visit to your aunt was in question\\nand woe betide him and her too when it comes to things of consequence\\nwhen they are placed in circumstances requiring fortitude and\\nstrength of mind if she have not resolution enough to resist\\nidle interference in such a trifle as this  Your sister is\\nan amiable creature but yours is the character of decision and firmness\\nI see  If you value her conduct or happiness infuse as much\\nof your own spirit into her as you can  But this no doubt\\nyou have been always doing  It is the worst evil of too yielding\\nand indecisive a character that no influence over it can be depended on\\nYou are never sure of a good impression being durable everybody\\nmay sway it  Let those who would be happy be firm  Here is a nut\\nsaid he catching one down from an upper bough  to exemplify\\na beautiful glossy nut which blessed with original strength\\nhas outlived all the storms of autumn  Not a puncture not\\na weak spot anywhere  This nut he continued with playful solemnity\\nwhile so many of his brethren have fallen and been trodden under foot\\nis still in possession of all the happiness that a hazel nut can be\\nsupposed capable of  Then returning to his former earnest tone\\nMy first wish for all whom I am interested in is that they should be firm\\nIf Louisa Musgrove would be beautiful and happy in her November of life\\nshe will cherish all her present powers of mind\\n\\nHe had done and was unanswered  It would have surprised Anne if Louisa\\ncould have readily answered such a speech  words of such interest\\nspoken with such serious warmth  She could imagine what Louisa was feeling\\nFor herself she feared to move lest she should be seen\\nWhile she remained a bush of low rambling holly protected her\\nand they were moving on  Before they were beyond her hearing\\nhowever Louisa spoke again\\n\\nMary is goodnatured enough in many respects said she\\nbut she does sometimes provoke me excessively by her nonsense\\nand pridethe Elliot pride  She has a great deal too much\\nof the Elliot pride  We do so wish that Charles had married Anne instead\\nI suppose you know he wanted to marry Anne\\n\\nAfter a moments pause Captain Wentworth said\\n\\nDo you mean that she refused him\\n\\nOh yes certainly\\n\\nWhen did that happen\\n\\nI do not exactly know for Henrietta and I were at school at the time\\nbut I believe about a year before he married Mary  I wish she had\\naccepted him  We should all have liked her a great deal better\\nand papa and mamma always think it was her great friend\\nLady Russells doing that she did not  They think Charles\\nmight not be learned and bookish enough to please Lady Russell\\nand that therefore she persuaded Anne to refuse him\\n\\nThe sounds were retreating and Anne distinguished no more\\nHer own emotions still kept her fixed  She had much to recover from\\nbefore she could move  The listeners proverbial fate was\\nnot absolutely hers she had heard no evil of herself but she had heard\\na great deal of very painful import  She saw how her own character\\nwas considered by Captain Wentworth and there had been just that degree\\nof feeling and curiosity about her in his manner which must give her\\nextreme agitation\\n\\nAs soon as she could she went after Mary and having found\\nand walked back with her to their former station by the stile\\nfelt some comfort in their whole party being immediately afterwards\\ncollected and once more in motion together  Her spirits wanted\\nthe solitude and silence which only numbers could give\\n\\nCharles and Henrietta returned bringing as may be conjectured\\nCharles Hayter with them  The minutiae of the business Anne\\ncould not attempt to understand even Captain Wentworth did not seem\\nadmitted to perfect confidence here but that there had been a withdrawing\\non the gentlemans side and a relenting on the ladys and that they\\nwere now very glad to be together again did not admit a doubt\\nHenrietta looked a little ashamed but very well pleased\\nCharles Hayter exceedingly happy  and they were devoted to each other\\nalmost from the first instant of their all setting forward for Uppercross\\n\\nEverything now marked out Louisa for Captain Wentworth\\nnothing could be plainer and where many divisions were necessary\\nor even where they were not they walked side by side nearly as much\\nas the other two  In a long strip of meadow land where there was\\nample space for all they were thus divided forming three distinct parties\\nand to that party of the three which boasted least animation\\nand least complaisance Anne necessarily belonged  She joined Charles\\nand Mary and was tired enough to be very glad of Charless other arm\\nbut Charles though in very good humour with her was out of temper\\nwith his wife  Mary had shewn herself disobliging to him\\nand was now to reap the consequence which consequence was\\nhis dropping her arm almost every moment to cut off the heads\\nof some nettles in the hedge with his switch and when Mary began\\nto complain of it and lament her being illused according to custom\\nin being on the hedge side while Anne was never incommoded on the other\\nhe dropped the arms of both to hunt after a weasel which he had\\na momentary glance of and they could hardly get him along at all\\n\\nThis long meadow bordered a lane which their footpath at the end of it\\nwas to cross and when the party had all reached the gate of exit\\nthe carriage advancing in the same direction which had been\\nsome time heard was just coming up and proved to be Admiral Crofts gig\\nHe and his wife had taken their intended drive and were returning home\\nUpon hearing how long a walk the young people had engaged in\\nthey kindly offered a seat to any lady who might be particularly tired\\nit would save her a full mile and they were going through Uppercross\\nThe invitation was general and generally declined  The Miss Musgroves\\nwere not at all tired and Mary was either offended by not being asked\\nbefore any of the others or what Louisa called the Elliot pride\\ncould not endure to make a third in a one horse chaise\\n\\nThe walking party had crossed the lane and were surmounting an\\nopposite stile and the Admiral was putting his horse in motion again\\nwhen Captain Wentworth cleared the hedge in a moment to say something\\nto his sister  The something might be guessed by its effects\\n\\nMiss Elliot I am sure you are tired cried Mrs Croft\\nDo let us have the pleasure of taking you home  Here is excellent room\\nfor three I assure you  If we were all like you I believe we might\\nsit four  You must indeed you must\\n\\nAnne was still in the lane and though instinctively beginning to decline\\nshe was not allowed to proceed  The Admirals kind urgency\\ncame in support of his wifes they would not be refused\\nthey compressed themselves into the smallest possible space\\nto leave her a corner and Captain Wentworth without saying a word\\nturned to her and quietly obliged her to be assisted into the carriage\\n\\nYes he had done it  She was in the carriage and felt that he had\\nplaced her there that his will and his hands had done it\\nthat she owed it to his perception of her fatigue and his resolution\\nto give her rest  She was very much affected by the view of\\nhis disposition towards her which all these things made apparent\\nThis little circumstance seemed the completion of all that had gone before\\nShe understood him  He could not forgive her but he could not\\nbe unfeeling  Though condemning her for the past and considering it\\nwith high and unjust resentment though perfectly careless of her\\nand though becoming attached to another still he could not see her suffer\\nwithout the desire of giving her relief  It was a remainder\\nof former sentiment it was an impulse of pure though unacknowledged\\nfriendship it was a proof of his own warm and amiable heart\\nwhich she could not contemplate without emotions so compounded\\nof pleasure and pain that she knew not which prevailed\\n\\nHer answers to the kindness and the remarks of her companions\\nwere at first unconsciously given  They had travelled half their way\\nalong the rough lane before she was quite awake to what they said\\nShe then found them talking of Frederick\\n\\nHe certainly means to have one or other of those two girls Sophy\\nsaid the Admiral but there is no saying which  He has been\\nrunning after them too long enough one would think to make up his mind\\nAy this comes of the peace  If it were war now he would have\\nsettled it long ago  We sailors Miss Elliot cannot afford to make\\nlong courtships in time of war  How many days was it my dear\\nbetween the first time of my seeing you and our sitting down together\\nin our lodgings at North Yarmouth\\n\\nWe had better not talk about it my dear replied Mrs Croft pleasantly\\nfor if Miss Elliot were to hear how soon we came to an understanding\\nshe would never be persuaded that we could be happy together\\nI had known you by character however long before\\n\\nWell and I had heard of you as a very pretty girl and what were we\\nto wait for besides  I do not like having such things so long in hand\\nI wish Frederick would spread a little more canvass and bring us home\\none of these young ladies to Kellynch  Then there would always\\nbe company for them  And very nice young ladies they both are\\nI hardly know one from the other\\n\\nVery good humoured unaffected girls indeed said Mrs Croft\\nin a tone of calmer praise such as made Anne suspect that\\nher keener powers might not consider either of them as quite worthy\\nof her brother and a very respectable family  One could not be\\nconnected with better people  My dear Admiral that post\\nwe shall certainly take that post\\n\\nBut by coolly giving the reins a better direction herself they happily\\npassed the danger and by once afterwards judiciously putting out\\nher hand they neither fell into a rut nor ran foul of a dungcart\\nand Anne with some amusement at their style of driving\\nwhich she imagined no bad representation of the general guidance\\nof their affairs found herself safely deposited by them at the Cottage\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 11\\n\\n\\nThe time now approached for Lady Russells return  the day was even fixed\\nand Anne being engaged to join her as soon as she was resettled\\nwas looking forward to an early removal to Kellynch and beginning\\nto think how her own comfort was likely to be affected by it\\n\\nIt would place her in the same village with Captain Wentworth\\nwithin half a mile of him they would have to frequent the same church\\nand there must be intercourse between the two families\\nThis was against her but on the other hand he spent so much of his time\\nat Uppercross that in removing thence she might be considered rather\\nas leaving him behind than as going towards him and upon the whole\\nshe believed she must on this interesting question be the gainer\\nalmost as certainly as in her change of domestic society\\nin leaving poor Mary for Lady Russell\\n\\nShe wished it might be possible for her to avoid ever seeing\\nCaptain Wentworth at the Hall  those rooms had witnessed\\nformer meetings which would be brought too painfully before her\\nbut she was yet more anxious for the possibility of Lady Russell and\\nCaptain Wentworth never meeting anywhere  They did not like each other\\nand no renewal of acquaintance now could do any good and were Lady Russell\\nto see them together she might think that he had too much selfpossession\\nand she too little\\n\\nThese points formed her chief solicitude in anticipating\\nher removal from Uppercross where she felt she had been stationed\\nquite long enough  Her usefulness to little Charles would always\\ngive some sweetness to the memory of her two months visit there\\nbut he was gaining strength apace and she had nothing else to stay for\\n\\nThe conclusion of her visit however was diversified in a way\\nwhich she had not at all imagined  Captain Wentworth after being unseen\\nand unheard of at Uppercross for two whole days appeared again among them\\nto justify himself by a relation of what had kept him away\\n\\nA letter from his friend Captain Harville having found him out at last\\nhad brought intelligence of Captain Harvilles being settled\\nwith his family at Lyme for the winter of their being therefore\\nquite unknowingly within twenty miles of each other  Captain Harville\\nhad never been in good health since a severe wound which he received\\ntwo years before and Captain Wentworths anxiety to see him\\nhad determined him to go immediately to Lyme  He had been there\\nfor fourandtwenty hours  His acquittal was complete\\nhis friendship warmly honoured a lively interest excited for his friend\\nand his description of the fine country about Lyme so feelingly attended to\\nby the party that an earnest desire to see Lyme themselves\\nand a project for going thither was the consequence\\n\\nThe young people were all wild to see Lyme  Captain Wentworth talked\\nof going there again himself it was only seventeen miles from Uppercross\\nthough November the weather was by no means bad and in short\\nLouisa who was the most eager of the eager having formed\\nthe resolution to go and besides the pleasure of doing as she liked\\nbeing now armed with the idea of merit in maintaining her own way\\nbore down all the wishes of her father and mother for putting it off\\ntill summer and to Lyme they were to goCharles Mary Anne Henrietta\\nLouisa and Captain Wentworth\\n\\nThe first heedless scheme had been to go in the morning and return at night\\nbut to this Mr Musgrove for the sake of his horses would not consent\\nand when it came to be rationally considered a day in\\nthe middle of November would not leave much time for seeing a new place\\nafter deducting seven hours as the nature of the country required\\nfor going and returning  They were consequently to stay the night there\\nand not to be expected back till the next days dinner  This was felt\\nto be a considerable amendment and though they all met at the Great House\\nat rather an early breakfast hour and set off very punctually\\nit was so much past noon before the two carriages Mr Musgroves coach\\ncontaining the four ladies and Charless curricle in which\\nhe drove Captain Wentworth were descending the long hill into Lyme\\nand entering upon the still steeper street of the town itself\\nthat it was very evident they would not have more than time\\nfor looking about them before the light and warmth of the day were gone\\n\\nAfter securing accommodations and ordering a dinner at one of the inns\\nthe next thing to be done was unquestionably to walk directly\\ndown to the sea  They were come too late in the year for any amusement\\nor variety which Lyme as a public place might offer  The rooms\\nwere shut up the lodgers almost all gone scarcely any family\\nbut of the residents left and as there is nothing to admire\\nin the buildings themselves the remarkable situation of the town\\nthe principal street almost hurrying into the water the walk to the Cobb\\nskirting round the pleasant little bay which in the season\\nis animated with bathing machines and company the Cobb itself\\nits old wonders and new improvements with the very beautiful\\nline of cliffs stretching out to the east of the town are what\\nthe strangers eye will seek and a very strange stranger it must be\\nwho does not see charms in the immediate environs of Lyme\\nto make him wish to know it better  The scenes in its neighbourhood\\nCharmouth with its high grounds and extensive sweeps of country\\nand still more its sweet retired bay backed by dark cliffs\\nwhere fragments of low rock among the sands make it the happiest spot\\nfor watching the flow of the tide for sitting in unwearied contemplation\\nthe woody varieties of the cheerful village of Up Lyme and above all\\nPinny with its green chasms between romantic rocks where\\nthe scattered forest trees and orchards of luxuriant growth\\ndeclare that many a generation must have passed away since the first\\npartial falling of the cliff prepared the ground for such a state\\nwhere a scene so wonderful and so lovely is exhibited as may\\nmore than equal any of the resembling scenes of the farfamed\\nIsle of Wight  these places must be visited and visited again\\nto make the worth of Lyme understood\\n\\nThe party from Uppercross passing down by the now deserted\\nand melancholy looking rooms and still descending soon found themselves\\non the seashore and lingering only as all must linger and gaze\\non a first return to the sea who ever deserved to look on it at all\\nproceeded towards the Cobb equally their object in itself\\nand on Captain Wentworths account  for in a small house\\nnear the foot of an old pier of unknown date were the Harvilles settled\\nCaptain Wentworth turned in to call on his friend the others walked on\\nand he was to join them on the Cobb\\n\\nThey were by no means tired of wondering and admiring and not even Louisa\\nseemed to feel that they had parted with Captain Wentworth long\\nwhen they saw him coming after them with three companions\\nall well known already by description to be Captain and Mrs Harville\\nand a Captain Benwick who was staying with them\\n\\nCaptain Benwick had some time ago been first lieutenant of the Laconia\\nand the account which Captain Wentworth had given of him\\non his return from Lyme before his warm praise of him as\\nan excellent young man and an officer whom he had always valued highly\\nwhich must have stamped him well in the esteem of every listener\\nhad been followed by a little history of his private life\\nwhich rendered him perfectly interesting in the eyes of all the ladies\\nHe had been engaged to Captain Harvilles sister and was now\\nmourning her loss  They had been a year or two waiting for fortune\\nand promotion  Fortune came his prizemoney as lieutenant being great\\npromotion too came at last but Fanny Harville did not live to know it\\nShe had died the preceding summer while he was at sea  Captain Wentworth\\nbelieved it impossible for man to be more attached to woman\\nthan poor Benwick had been to Fanny Harville or to be more deeply\\nafflicted under the dreadful change  He considered his disposition\\nas of the sort which must suffer heavily uniting very strong feelings\\nwith quiet serious and retiring manners and a decided taste for reading\\nand sedentary pursuits  To finish the interest of the story\\nthe friendship between him and the Harvilles seemed if possible\\naugmented by the event which closed all their views of alliance\\nand Captain Benwick was now living with them entirely  Captain Harville\\nhad taken his present house for half a year his taste and his health\\nand his fortune all directing him to a residence inexpensive\\nand by the sea and the grandeur of the country and the retirement\\nof Lyme in the winter appeared exactly adapted to Captain Benwicks\\nstate of mind  The sympathy and goodwill excited towards Captain Benwick\\nwas very great\\n\\nAnd yet said Anne to herself as they now moved forward\\nto meet the party he has not perhaps a more sorrowing heart\\nthan I have  I cannot believe his prospects so blighted for ever\\nHe is younger than I am younger in feeling if not in fact\\nyounger as a man  He will rally again and be happy with another\\n\\nThey all met and were introduced  Captain Harville was a tall\\ndark man with a sensible benevolent countenance a little lame\\nand from strong features and want of health looking much older\\nthan Captain Wentworth  Captain Benwick looked and was\\nthe youngest of the three and compared with either of them\\na little man  He had a pleasing face and a melancholy air\\njust as he ought to have and drew back from conversation\\n\\nCaptain Harville though not equalling Captain Wentworth in manners\\nwas a perfect gentleman unaffected warm and obliging\\nMrs Harville a degree less polished than her husband seemed however\\nto have the same good feelings and nothing could be more pleasant\\nthan their desire of considering the whole party as friends of their own\\nbecause the friends of Captain Wentworth or more kindly hospitable\\nthan their entreaties for their all promising to dine with them\\nThe dinner already ordered at the inn was at last though unwillingly\\naccepted as a excuse but they seemed almost hurt that Captain Wentworth\\nshould have brought any such party to Lyme without considering it\\nas a thing of course that they should dine with them\\n\\nThere was so much attachment to Captain Wentworth in all this\\nand such a bewitching charm in a degree of hospitality so uncommon\\nso unlike the usual style of giveandtake invitations and dinners\\nof formality and display that Anne felt her spirits not likely to be\\nbenefited by an increasing acquaintance among his brotherofficers\\nThese would have been all my friends was her thought\\nand she had to struggle against a great tendency to lowness\\n\\nOn quitting the Cobb they all went indoors with their new friends\\nand found rooms so small as none but those who invite from the heart\\ncould think capable of accommodating so many  Anne had\\na moments astonishment on the subject herself but it was soon lost\\nin the pleasanter feelings which sprang from the sight of all\\nthe ingenious contrivances and nice arrangements of Captain Harville\\nto turn the actual space to the best account to supply the deficiencies\\nof lodginghouse furniture and defend the windows and doors\\nagainst the winter storms to be expected  The varieties in\\nthe fittingup of the rooms where the common necessaries\\nprovided by the owner in the common indifferent plight\\nwere contrasted with some few articles of a rare species of wood\\nexcellently worked up and with something curious and valuable\\nfrom all the distant countries Captain Harville had visited\\nwere more than amusing to Anne connected as it all was with his profession\\nthe fruit of its labours the effect of its influence on his habits\\nthe picture of repose and domestic happiness it presented\\nmade it to her a something more or less than gratification\\n\\nCaptain Harville was no reader but he had contrived\\nexcellent accommodations and fashioned very pretty shelves\\nfor a tolerable collection of wellbound volumes the property of\\nCaptain Benwick  His lameness prevented him from taking much exercise\\nbut a mind of usefulness and ingenuity seemed to furnish him with\\nconstant employment within  He drew he varnished he carpentered\\nhe glued he made toys for the children he fashioned new nettingneedles\\nand pins with improvements and if everything else was done\\nsat down to his large fishingnet at one corner of the room\\n\\nAnne thought she left great happiness behind her when they\\nquitted the house and Louisa by whom she found herself walking\\nburst forth into raptures of admiration and delight on the character\\nof the navy their friendliness their brotherliness their openness\\ntheir uprightness protesting that she was convinced of sailors having\\nmore worth and warmth than any other set of men in England\\nthat they only knew how to live and they only deserved to be\\nrespected and loved\\n\\nThey went back to dress and dine and so well had the scheme\\nanswered already that nothing was found amiss though its being\\nso entirely out of season and the no thoroughfare of Lyme\\nand the no expectation of company had brought many apologies\\nfrom the heads of the inn\\n\\nAnne found herself by this time growing so much more hardened\\nto being in Captain Wentworths company than she had at first imagined\\ncould ever be that the sitting down to the same table with him now\\nand the interchange of the common civilities attending on it\\nthey never got beyond was become a mere nothing\\n\\nThe nights were too dark for the ladies to meet again till the morrow\\nbut Captain Harville had promised them a visit in the evening\\nand he came bringing his friend also which was more than\\nhad been expected it having been agreed that Captain Benwick\\nhad all the appearance of being oppressed by the presence of\\nso many strangers  He ventured among them again however\\nthough his spirits certainly did not seem fit for the mirth\\nof the party in general\\n\\nWhile Captains Wentworth and Harville led the talk on one side of the room\\nand by recurring to former days supplied anecdotes in abundance\\nto occupy and entertain the others it fell to Annes lot to be placed\\nrather apart with Captain Benwick and a very good impulse\\nof her nature obliged her to begin an acquaintance with him\\nHe was shy and disposed to abstraction but the engaging mildness of\\nher countenance and gentleness of her manners soon had their effect\\nand Anne was well repaid the first trouble of exertion\\nHe was evidently a young man of considerable taste in reading\\nthough principally in poetry and besides the persuasion of having\\ngiven him at least an evenings indulgence in the discussion of subjects\\nwhich his usual companions had probably no concern in she had the hope\\nof being of real use to him in some suggestions as to the duty and\\nbenefit of struggling against affliction which had naturally grown out\\nof their conversation  For though shy he did not seem reserved\\nit had rather the appearance of feelings glad to burst their\\nusual restraints and having talked of poetry the richness of\\nthe present age and gone through a brief comparison of opinion\\nas to the firstrate poets trying to ascertain whether Marmion\\nor The Lady of the Lake were to be preferred and how ranked the Giaour\\nand The Bride of Abydos and moreover how the Giaour was to be pronounced\\nhe showed himself so intimately acquainted with all the tenderest songs\\nof the one poet and all the impassioned descriptions of hopeless agony\\nof the other he repeated with such tremulous feeling the various lines\\nwhich imaged a broken heart or a mind destroyed by wretchedness\\nand looked so entirely as if he meant to be understood\\nthat she ventured to hope he did not always read only poetry\\nand to say that she thought it was the misfortune of poetry to be\\nseldom safely enjoyed by those who enjoyed it completely\\nand that the strong feelings which alone could estimate it truly\\nwere the very feelings which ought to taste it but sparingly\\n\\nHis looks shewing him not pained but pleased with this allusion\\nto his situation she was emboldened to go on and feeling in herself\\nthe right of seniority of mind she ventured to recommend\\na larger allowance of prose in his daily study and on being requested\\nto particularize mentioned such works of our best moralists\\nsuch collections of the finest letters such memoirs of characters\\nof worth and suffering as occurred to her at the moment\\nas calculated to rouse and fortify the mind by the highest precepts\\nand the strongest examples of moral and religious endurances\\n\\nCaptain Benwick listened attentively and seemed grateful for\\nthe interest implied and though with a shake of the head\\nand sighs which declared his little faith in the efficacy of any books\\non grief like his noted down the names of those she recommended\\nand promised to procure and read them\\n\\nWhen the evening was over Anne could not but be amused at the idea\\nof her coming to Lyme to preach patience and resignation to a young man\\nwhom she had never seen before nor could she help fearing\\non more serious reflection that like many other great moralists\\nand preachers she had been eloquent on a point in which her own conduct\\nwould ill bear examination\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 12\\n\\n\\nAnne and Henrietta finding themselves the earliest of the party\\nthe next morning agreed to stroll down to the sea before breakfast\\nThey went to the sands to watch the flowing of the tide\\nwhich a fine southeasterly breeze was bringing in with all the grandeur\\nwhich so flat a shore admitted  They praised the morning\\ngloried in the sea sympathized in the delight of the freshfeeling\\nbreezeand were silent till Henrietta suddenly began again with\\n\\nOh yesI am quite convinced that with very few exceptions\\nthe seaair always does good  There can be no doubt of its having been\\nof the greatest service to Dr Shirley after his illness\\nlast spring twelvemonth  He declares himself that coming to Lyme\\nfor a month did him more good than all the medicine he took\\nand that being by the sea always makes him feel young again\\nNow I cannot help thinking it a pity that he does not live\\nentirely by the sea  I do think he had better leave Uppercross entirely\\nand fix at Lyme  Do not you Anne  Do not you agree with me\\nthat it is the best thing he could do both for himself and Mrs Shirley\\nShe has cousins here you know and many acquaintance which would\\nmake it cheerful for her and I am sure she would be glad\\nto get to a place where she could have medical attendance at hand\\nin case of his having another seizure  Indeed I think it quite melancholy\\nto have such excellent people as Dr and Mrs Shirley who have been\\ndoing good all their lives wearing out their last days in a place\\nlike Uppercross where excepting our family they seem shut out\\nfrom all the world  I wish his friends would propose it to him\\nI really think they ought  And as to procuring a dispensation\\nthere could be no difficulty at his time of life and with his character\\nMy only doubt is whether anything could persuade him to leave his parish\\nHe is so very strict and scrupulous in his notions overscrupulous\\nI must say  Do not you think Anne it is being overscrupulous\\nDo not you think it is quite a mistaken point of conscience\\nwhen a clergyman sacrifices his health for the sake of duties\\nwhich may be just as well performed by another person  And at Lyme too\\nonly seventeen miles off he would be near enough to hear\\nif people thought there was anything to complain of\\n\\nAnne smiled more than once to herself during this speech\\nand entered into the subject as ready to do good by entering into\\nthe feelings of a young lady as of a young man though here it was good\\nof a lower standard for what could be offered but general acquiescence\\nShe said all that was reasonable and proper on the business\\nfelt the claims of Dr Shirley to repose as she ought saw how very\\ndesirable it was that he should have some active respectable young man\\nas a resident curate and was even courteous enough to hint at\\nthe advantage of such resident curates being married\\n\\nI wish said Henrietta very well pleased with her companion\\nI wish Lady Russell lived at Uppercross and were intimate\\nwith Dr Shirley  I have always heard of Lady Russell as a woman of\\nthe greatest influence with everybody  I always look upon her as able\\nto persuade a person to anything  I am afraid of her as I have\\ntold you before quite afraid of her because she is so very clever\\nbut I respect her amazingly and wish we had such a neighbour\\nat Uppercross\\n\\nAnne was amused by Henriettas manner of being grateful\\nand amused also that the course of events and the new interests\\nof Henriettas views should have placed her friend at all in favour\\nwith any of the Musgrove family she had only time however\\nfor a general answer and a wish that such another woman\\nwere at Uppercross before all subjects suddenly ceased\\non seeing Louisa and Captain Wentworth coming towards them\\nThey came also for a stroll till breakfast was likely to be ready\\nbut Louisa recollecting immediately afterwards that she had something\\nto procure at a shop invited them all to go back with her into the town\\nThey were all at her disposal\\n\\nWhen they came to the steps leading upwards from the beach a gentleman\\nat the same moment preparing to come down politely drew back\\nand stopped to give them way  They ascended and passed him\\nand as they passed Annes face caught his eye and he looked at her\\nwith a degree of earnest admiration which she could not be insensible of\\nShe was looking remarkably well her very regular very pretty features\\nhaving the bloom and freshness of youth restored by the fine wind\\nwhich had been blowing on her complexion and by the animation of eye\\nwhich it had also produced  It was evident that the gentleman\\ncompletely a gentleman in manner admired her exceedingly\\nCaptain Wentworth looked round at her instantly in a way which\\nshewed his noticing of it  He gave her a momentary glance\\na glance of brightness which seemed to say That man is struck with you\\nand even I at this moment see something like Anne Elliot again\\n\\nAfter attending Louisa through her business and loitering about\\na little longer they returned to the inn and Anne in passing afterwards\\nquickly from her own chamber to their diningroom had nearly run against\\nthe very same gentleman as he came out of an adjoining apartment\\nShe had before conjectured him to be a stranger like themselves\\nand determined that a welllooking groom who was strolling about\\nnear the two inns as they came back should be his servant\\nBoth master and man being in mourning assisted the idea\\nIt was now proved that he belonged to the same inn as themselves\\nand this second meeting short as it was also proved again\\nby the gentlemans looks that he thought hers very lovely\\nand by the readiness and propriety of his apologies that he was\\na man of exceedingly good manners  He seemed about thirty\\nand though not handsome had an agreeable person  Anne felt that\\nshe should like to know who he was\\n\\nThey had nearly done breakfast when the sound of a carriage\\nalmost the first they had heard since entering Lyme drew half the party\\nto the window  It was a gentlemans carriage a curricle\\nbut only coming round from the stableyard to the front door\\nsomebody must be going away  It was driven by a servant in mourning\\n\\nThe word curricle made Charles Musgrove jump up that he might\\ncompare it with his own the servant in mourning roused Annes curiosity\\nand the whole six were collected to look by the time the owner\\nof the curricle was to be seen issuing from the door amidst the bows\\nand civilities of the household and taking his seat to drive off\\n\\nAh cried Captain Wentworth instantly and with half a glance at Anne\\nit is the very man we passed\\n\\nThe Miss Musgroves agreed to it and having all kindly watched him\\nas far up the hill as they could they returned to the breakfast table\\nThe waiter came into the room soon afterwards\\n\\nPray said Captain Wentworth immediately can you tell us the name\\nof the gentleman who is just gone away\\n\\nYes Sir a Mr Elliot a gentleman of large fortune came in last night\\nfrom Sidmouth  Dare say you heard the carriage sir while you were\\nat dinner and going on now for Crewkherne in his way to Bath\\nand London\\n\\nElliot  Many had looked on each other and many had repeated the name\\nbefore all this had been got through even by the smart rapidity\\nof a waiter\\n\\nBless me cried Mary it must be our cousin it must be our Mr Elliot\\nit must indeed  Charles Anne must not it  In mourning you see\\njust as our Mr Elliot must be  How very extraordinary\\nIn the very same inn with us  Anne must not it be our Mr Elliot\\nmy fathers next heir  Pray sir turning to the waiter\\ndid not you hear did not his servant say whether he belonged\\nto the Kellynch family\\n\\nNo maam he did not mention no particular family but he said\\nhis master was a very rich gentleman and would be a baronight some day\\n\\nThere you see cried Mary in an ecstasy just as I said\\nHeir to Sir Walter Elliot  I was sure that would come out\\nif it was so  Depend upon it that is a circumstance which his servants\\ntake care to publish wherever he goes  But Anne only conceive\\nhow extraordinary  I wish I had looked at him more  I wish we had\\nbeen aware in time who it was that he might have been introduced to us\\nWhat a pity that we should not have been introduced to each other\\nDo you think he had the Elliot countenance  I hardly looked at him\\nI was looking at the horses but I think he had something\\nof the Elliot countenance I wonder the arms did not strike me\\nOh the greatcoat was hanging over the panel and hid the arms\\nso it did otherwise I am sure I should have observed them\\nand the livery too if the servant had not been in mourning\\none should have known him by the livery\\n\\nPutting all these very extraordinary circumstances together\\nsaid Captain Wentworth we must consider it to be the arrangement\\nof Providence that you should not be introduced to your cousin\\n\\nWhen she could command Marys attention Anne quietly tried\\nto convince her that their father and Mr Elliot had not for many years\\nbeen on such terms as to make the power of attempting an introduction\\nat all desirable\\n\\nAt the same time however it was a secret gratification to herself\\nto have seen her cousin and to know that the future owner of Kellynch\\nwas undoubtedly a gentleman and had an air of good sense\\nShe would not upon any account mention her having met with him\\nthe second time luckily Mary did not much attend to their having\\npassed close by him in their earlier walk but she would have felt\\nquite illused by Annes having actually run against him in the passage\\nand received his very polite excuses while she had never been\\nnear him at all no that cousinly little interview must remain\\na perfect secret\\n\\nOf course said Mary you will mention our seeing Mr Elliot\\nthe next time you write to Bath  I think my father certainly\\nought to hear of it do mention all about him\\n\\nAnne avoided a direct reply but it was just the circumstance\\nwhich she considered as not merely unnecessary to be communicated\\nbut as what ought to be suppressed  The offence which had been given\\nher father many years back she knew Elizabeths particular share in it\\nshe suspected and that Mr Elliots idea always produced irritation in both\\nwas beyond a doubt  Mary never wrote to Bath herself all the toil\\nof keeping up a slow and unsatisfactory correspondence with Elizabeth\\nfell on Anne\\n\\nBreakfast had not been long over when they were joined by Captain\\nand Mrs Harville and Captain Benwick with whom they had appointed\\nto take their last walk about Lyme  They ought to be setting off\\nfor Uppercross by one and in the mean while were to be all together\\nand out of doors as long as they could\\n\\nAnne found Captain Benwick getting near her as soon as they were all\\nfairly in the street  Their conversation the preceding evening\\ndid not disincline him to seek her again and they walked together\\nsome time talking as before of Mr Scott and Lord Byron\\nand still as unable as before and as unable as any other two readers\\nto think exactly alike of the merits of either till something\\noccasioned an almost general change amongst their party and instead of\\nCaptain Benwick she had Captain Harville by her side\\n\\nMiss Elliot said he speaking rather low you have done a good deed\\nin making that poor fellow talk so much  I wish he could have\\nsuch company oftener  It is bad for him I know to be shut up as he is\\nbut what can we do  We cannot part\\n\\nNo said Anne that I can easily believe to be impossible\\nbut in time perhapswe know what time does in every case of affliction\\nand you must remember Captain Harville that your friend\\nmay yet be called a young mourneronly last summer I understand\\n\\nAy true enough with a deep sigh only June\\n\\nAnd not known to him perhaps so soon\\n\\nNot till the first week of August when he came home from the Cape\\njust made into the Grappler  I was at Plymouth dreading to hear of him\\nhe sent in letters but the Grappler was under orders for Portsmouth\\nThere the news must follow him but who was to tell it not I\\nI would as soon have been run up to the yardarm  Nobody could do it\\nbut that good fellow pointing to Captain Wentworth  The Laconia\\nhad come into Plymouth the week before no danger of her\\nbeing sent to sea again  He stood his chance for the rest\\nwrote up for leave of absence but without waiting the return\\ntravelled night and day till he got to Portsmouth rowed off\\nto the Grappler that instant and never left the poor fellow for a week\\nThats what he did and nobody else could have saved poor James\\nYou may think Miss Elliot whether he is dear to us\\n\\nAnne did think on the question with perfect decision and said as much\\nin reply as her own feeling could accomplish or as his seemed\\nable to bear for he was too much affected to renew the subject\\nand when he spoke again it was of something totally different\\n\\nMrs Harvilles giving it as her opinion that her husband would have\\nquite walking enough by the time he reached home determined the direction\\nof all the party in what was to be their last walk they would\\naccompany them to their door and then return and set off themselves\\nBy all their calculations there was just time for this but as they drew\\nnear the Cobb there was such a general wish to walk along it once more\\nall were so inclined and Louisa soon grew so determined\\nthat the difference of a quarter of an hour it was found\\nwould be no difference at all so with all the kind leavetaking\\nand all the kind interchange of invitations and promises which\\nmay be imagined they parted from Captain and Mrs Harville\\nat their own door and still accompanied by Captain Benwick\\nwho seemed to cling to them to the last proceeded to make\\nthe proper adieus to the Cobb\\n\\nAnne found Captain Benwick again drawing near her  Lord Byrons\\ndark blue seas could not fail of being brought forward by\\ntheir present view and she gladly gave him all her attention as long as\\nattention was possible  It was soon drawn perforce another way\\n\\nThere was too much wind to make the high part of the new Cobb pleasant\\nfor the ladies and they agreed to get down the steps to the lower\\nand all were contented to pass quietly and carefully down the steep flight\\nexcepting Louisa she must be jumped down them by Captain Wentworth\\nIn all their walks he had had to jump her from the stiles\\nthe sensation was delightful to her  The hardness of the pavement\\nfor her feet made him less willing upon the present occasion\\nhe did it however  She was safely down and instantly\\nto show her enjoyment ran up the steps to be jumped down again\\nHe advised her against it thought the jar too great but no\\nhe reasoned and talked in vain she smiled and said I am determined\\nI will he put out his hands she was too precipitate by half a second\\nshe fell on the pavement on the Lower Cobb and was taken up lifeless\\nThere was no wound no blood no visible bruise but her eyes were closed\\nshe breathed not her face was like death  The horror of the moment\\nto all who stood around\\n\\nCaptain Wentworth who had caught her up knelt with her in his arms\\nlooking on her with a face as pallid as her own in an agony of silence\\nShe is dead she is dead screamed Mary catching hold of her\\nhusband and contributing with his own horror to make him immoveable\\nand in another moment Henrietta sinking under the conviction lost\\nher senses too and would have fallen on the steps but for Captain\\nBenwick and Anne who caught and supported her between them\\n\\nIs there no one to help me were the first words which\\nburst from Captain Wentworth in a tone of despair and as if\\nall his own strength were gone\\n\\nGo to him go to him cried Anne for heavens sake go to him\\nI can support her myself  Leave me and go to him  Rub her hands\\nrub her temples here are salts take them take them\\n\\nCaptain Benwick obeyed and Charles at the same moment\\ndisengaging himself from his wife they were both with him\\nand Louisa was raised up and supported more firmly between them\\nand everything was done that Anne had prompted but in vain\\nwhile Captain Wentworth staggering against the wall for his support\\nexclaimed in the bitterest agony\\n\\nOh God her father and mother\\n\\nA surgeon said Anne\\n\\nHe caught the word it seemed to rouse him at once and saying only\\nTrue true a surgeon this instant was darting away\\nwhen Anne eagerly suggested\\n\\nCaptain Benwick would not it be better for Captain Benwick\\nHe knows where a surgeon is to be found\\n\\nEvery one capable of thinking felt the advantage of the idea\\nand in a moment it was all done in rapid moments Captain Benwick had\\nresigned the poor corpselike  figure entirely to the brothers care\\nand was off for the town with the utmost rapidity\\n\\nAs to the wretched party left behind it could scarcely be said\\nwhich of the three who were completely rational was suffering most\\nCaptain Wentworth Anne or Charles who really a very affectionate\\nbrother hung over Louisa with sobs of grief and could only turn his eyes\\nfrom one sister to see the other in a state as insensible\\nor to witness the hysterical agitations of his wife calling on him\\nfor help which he could not give\\n\\nAnne attending with all the strength and zeal and thought\\nwhich instinct supplied to Henrietta still tried at intervals\\nto suggest comfort to the others tried to quiet Mary to animate Charles\\nto assuage the feelings of Captain Wentworth  Both seemed to look to her\\nfor directions\\n\\nAnne Anne cried Charles What is to be done next\\nWhat in heavens name is to be done next\\n\\nCaptain Wentworths eyes were also turned towards her\\n\\nHad not she better be carried to the inn  Yes I am sure\\ncarry her gently to the inn\\n\\nYes yes to the inn repeated Captain Wentworth comparatively\\ncollected and eager to be doing something  I will carry her myself\\nMusgrove take care of the others\\n\\nBy this time the report of the accident had spread among the workmen\\nand boatmen about the Cobb and many were collected near them\\nto be useful if wanted at any rate to enjoy the sight of\\na dead young lady nay two dead young ladies for it proved twice as fine\\nas the first report  To some of the bestlooking of these good people\\nHenrietta was consigned for though partially revived\\nshe was quite helpless and in this manner Anne walking by her side\\nand Charles attending to his wife they set forward treading back\\nwith feelings unutterable the ground which so lately so very lately\\nand so light of heart they had passed along\\n\\nThey were not off the Cobb before the Harvilles met them\\nCaptain Benwick had been seen flying by their house with a countenance\\nwhich showed something to be wrong and they had set off immediately\\ninformed and directed as they passed towards the spot\\nShocked as Captain Harville was he brought senses and nerves\\nthat could be instantly useful and a look between him and his wife\\ndecided what was to be done  She must be taken to their house\\nall must go to their house and await the surgeons arrival there\\nThey would not listen to scruples  he was obeyed they were all\\nbeneath his roof and while Louisa under Mrs Harvilles direction\\nwas conveyed up stairs and given possession of her own bed\\nassistance cordials restoratives were supplied by her husband\\nto all who needed them\\n\\nLouisa had once opened her eyes but soon closed them again\\nwithout apparent consciousness  This had been a proof of life\\nhowever of service to her sister and Henrietta though perfectly\\nincapable of being in the same room with Louisa was kept\\nby the agitation of hope and fear from a return of her own insensibility\\nMary too was growing calmer\\n\\nThe surgeon was with them almost before it had seemed possible\\nThey were sick with horror while he examined but he was not hopeless\\nThe head had received a severe contusion but he had seen greater injuries\\nrecovered from  he was by no means hopeless he spoke cheerfully\\n\\nThat he did not regard it as a desperate case that he did not say\\na few hours must end it was at first felt beyond the hope of most\\nand the ecstasy of such a reprieve the rejoicing deep and silent\\nafter a few fervent ejaculations of gratitude to Heaven had been offered\\nmay be conceived\\n\\nThe tone the look with which Thank God was uttered\\nby Captain Wentworth Anne was sure could never be forgotten by her\\nnor the sight of him afterwards as he sat near a table leaning over it\\nwith folded arms and face concealed as if overpowered by\\nthe various feelings of his soul and trying by prayer and reflection\\nto calm them\\n\\nLouisas limbs had escaped  There was no injury but to the head\\n\\nIt now became necessary for the party to consider what was best to be done\\nas to their general situation  They were now able to speak to each other\\nand consult  That Louisa must remain where she was however distressing\\nto her friends to be involving the Harvilles in such trouble\\ndid not admit a doubt  Her removal was impossible  The Harvilles\\nsilenced all scruples and as much as they could all gratitude\\nThey had looked forward and arranged everything before the others\\nbegan to reflect  Captain Benwick must give up his room to them\\nand get another bed elsewhere and the whole was settled\\nThey were only concerned that the house could accommodate no more\\nand yet perhaps by putting the children away in the maids room\\nor swinging a cot somewhere they could hardly bear to think of not\\nfinding room for two or three besides supposing they might wish to stay\\nthough with regard to any attendance on Miss Musgrove there need not be\\nthe least uneasiness in leaving her to Mrs Harvilles care entirely\\nMrs Harville was a very experienced nurse and her nurserymaid\\nwho had lived with her long and gone about with her everywhere\\nwas just such another  Between these two she could want\\nno possible attendance by day or night  And all this was said\\nwith a truth and sincerity of feeling irresistible\\n\\nCharles Henrietta and Captain Wentworth were the three in consultation\\nand for a little while it was only an interchange of perplexity and terror\\nUppercross the necessity of some ones going to Uppercross\\nthe news to be conveyed how it could be broken to Mr and Mrs Musgrove\\nthe lateness of the morning an hour already gone since they\\nought to have been off the impossibility of being in tolerable time\\nAt first they were capable of nothing more to the purpose\\nthan such exclamations but after a while Captain Wentworth\\nexerting himself said\\n\\nWe must be decided and without the loss of another minute\\nEvery minute is valuable  Some one must resolve on being off\\nfor Uppercross instantly  Musgrove either you or I must go\\n\\nCharles agreed but declared his resolution of not going away\\nHe would be as little incumbrance as possible to Captain and Mrs Harville\\nbut as to leaving his sister in such a state he neither ought nor would\\nSo far it was decided and Henrietta at first declared the same\\nShe however was soon persuaded to think differently  The usefulness\\nof her staying  She who had not been able to remain in Louisas room\\nor to look at her without sufferings which made her worse than helpless\\nShe was forced to acknowledge that she could do no good\\nyet was still unwilling to be away till touched by the thought\\nof her father and mother she gave it up she consented\\nshe was anxious to be at home\\n\\nThe plan had reached this point when Anne coming quietly\\ndown from Louisas room could not but hear what followed\\nfor the parlour door was open\\n\\nThen it is settled Musgrove cried Captain Wentworth\\nthat you stay and that I take care of your sister home\\nBut as to the rest as to the others if one stays to assist Mrs Harville\\nI think it need be only one  Mrs Charles Musgrove will of course\\nwish to get back to her children but if Anne will stay no one so proper\\nso capable as Anne\\n\\nShe paused a moment to recover from the emotion of hearing herself\\nso spoken of  The other two warmly agreed with what he said\\nand she then appeared\\n\\nYou will stay I am sure you will stay and nurse her cried he\\nturning to her and speaking with a glow and yet a gentleness\\nwhich seemed almost restoring the past  She coloured deeply\\nand he recollected himself and moved away  She expressed herself\\nmost willing ready happy to remain  It was what she had been\\nthinking of and wishing to be allowed to do  A bed on the floor\\nin Louisas room would be sufficient for her if Mrs Harville\\nwould but think so\\n\\nOne thing more and all seemed arranged  Though it was rather desirable\\nthat Mr and Mrs Musgrove should be previously alarmed by some\\nshare of delay yet the time required by the Uppercross horses\\nto take them back would be a dreadful extension of suspense\\nand Captain Wentworth proposed and Charles Musgrove agreed\\nthat it would be much better for him to take a chaise from the inn\\nand leave Mr Musgroves carriage and horses to be sent home\\nthe next morning early when there would be the farther advantage\\nof sending an account of Louisas night\\n\\nCaptain Wentworth now hurried off to get everything ready on his part\\nand to be soon followed by the two ladies  When the plan was\\nmade known to Mary however there was an end of all peace in it\\nShe was so wretched and so vehement complained so much of injustice\\nin being expected to go away instead of Anne Anne who was\\nnothing to Louisa while she was her sister and had the best right\\nto stay in Henriettas stead  Why was not she to be as useful as Anne\\nAnd to go home without Charles too without her husband\\nNo it was too unkind  And in short she said more than her husband\\ncould long withstand and as none of the others could oppose\\nwhen he gave way there was no help for it the change of Mary for Anne\\nwas inevitable\\n\\nAnne had never submitted more reluctantly to the jealous\\nand illjudging claims of Mary but so it must be and they set off\\nfor the town Charles taking care of his sister and Captain Benwick\\nattending to her  She gave a moments recollection as they hurried along\\nto the little circumstances which the same spots had witnessed\\nearlier in the morning  There she had listened to Henriettas schemes\\nfor Dr Shirleys leaving Uppercross farther on she had\\nfirst seen Mr Elliot a moment seemed all that could now be given\\nto any one but Louisa or those who were wrapt up in her welfare\\n\\nCaptain Benwick was most considerately attentive to her and\\nunited as they all seemed by the distress of the day she felt\\nan increasing degree of goodwill towards him and a pleasure even\\nin thinking that it might perhaps be the occasion of continuing\\ntheir acquaintance\\n\\nCaptain Wentworth was on the watch for them and a chaise and four in waiting\\nstationed for their convenience in the lowest part of the street\\nbut his evident surprise and vexation at the substitution of one sister\\nfor the other the change in his countenance the astonishment\\nthe expressions begun and suppressed with which Charles was listened to\\nmade but a mortifying reception of Anne or must at least convince her\\nthat she was valued only as she could be useful to Louisa\\n\\nShe endeavoured to be composed and to be just  Without emulating\\nthe feelings of an Emma towards her Henry she would have\\nattended on Louisa with a zeal above the common claims of regard\\nfor his sake and she hoped he would not long be so unjust\\nas to suppose she would shrink unnecessarily from the office of a friend\\n\\nIn the mean while she was in the carriage  He had handed them both in\\nand placed himself between them and in this manner under these\\ncircumstances full of astonishment and emotion to Anne she quitted Lyme\\nHow the long stage would pass how it was to affect their manners\\nwhat was to be their sort of intercourse she could not foresee\\nIt was all quite natural however  He was devoted to Henrietta\\nalways turning towards her and when he spoke at all always with the view\\nof supporting her hopes and raising her spirits  In general\\nhis voice and manner were studiously calm  To spare Henrietta\\nfrom agitation seemed the governing principle  Once only\\nwhen she had been grieving over the last illjudged illfated\\nwalk to the Cobb bitterly lamenting that it ever had been thought of\\nhe burst forth as if wholly overcome\\n\\nDont talk of it dont talk of it he cried  Oh God that I had\\nnot given way to her at the fatal moment  Had I done as I ought\\nBut so eager and so resolute Dear sweet Louisa\\n\\nAnne wondered whether it ever occurred to him now to question the justness\\nof his own previous opinion as to the universal felicity and advantage\\nof firmness of character and whether it might not strike him that\\nlike all other qualities of the mind it should have its proportions\\nand limits  She thought it could scarcely escape him to feel\\nthat a persuadable temper might sometimes be as much in favour of happiness\\nas a very resolute character\\n\\nThey got on fast  Anne was astonished to recognise the same hills\\nand the same objects so soon  Their actual speed heightened by\\nsome dread of the conclusion made the road appear but half as long\\nas on the day before  It was growing quite dusk however\\nbefore they were in the neighbourhood of Uppercross and there had been\\ntotal silence among them for some time Henrietta leaning back\\nin the corner with a shawl over her face giving the hope of her\\nhaving cried herself to sleep when as they were going up their last hill\\nAnne found herself all at once addressed by Captain Wentworth\\nIn a low cautious voice he said \\n\\nI have been considering what we had best do  She must not\\nappear at first  She could not stand it  I have been thinking whether\\nyou had not better remain in the carriage with her while I go in\\nand break it to Mr and Mrs Musgrove  Do you think this is a good plan\\n\\nShe did  he was satisfied and said no more  But the remembrance\\nof the appeal remained a pleasure to her as a proof of friendship\\nand of deference for her judgement a great pleasure and when it became\\na sort of parting proof its value did not lessen\\n\\nWhen the distressing communication at Uppercross was over\\nand he had seen the father and mother quite as composed as could be hoped\\nand the daughter all the better for being with them he announced\\nhis intention of returning in the same carriage to Lyme\\nand when the horses were baited he was off\\n\\nEnd of volume one\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 13\\n\\n\\nThe remainder of Annes time at Uppercross comprehending only two days\\nwas spent entirely at the Mansion House and she had the satisfaction\\nof knowing herself extremely useful there both as an immediate companion\\nand as assisting in all those arrangements for the future which\\nin Mr and Mrs Musgroves distressed state of spirits would have\\nbeen difficulties\\n\\nThey had an early account from Lyme the next morning  Louisa was\\nmuch the same  No symptoms worse than before had appeared\\nCharles came a few hours afterwards to bring a later and\\nmore particular account  He was tolerably cheerful  A speedy cure\\nmust not be hoped but everything was going on as well\\nas the nature of the case admitted  In speaking of the Harvilles\\nhe seemed unable to satisfy his own sense of their kindness\\nespecially of Mrs Harvilles exertions as a nurse  She really left\\nnothing for Mary to do  He and Mary had been persuaded to go early\\nto their inn last night  Mary had been hysterical again this morning\\nWhen he came away she was going to walk out with Captain Benwick\\nwhich he hoped would do her good  He almost wished she had been\\nprevailed on to come home the day before but the truth was\\nthat Mrs Harville left nothing for anybody to do\\n\\nCharles was to return to Lyme the same afternoon and his father\\nhad at first half a mind to go with him but the ladies could not consent\\nIt would be going only to multiply trouble to the others\\nand increase his own distress and a much better scheme followed\\nand was acted upon  A chaise was sent for from Crewkherne\\nand Charles conveyed back a far more useful person in the old nurserymaid\\nof the family one who having brought up all the children\\nand seen the very last the lingering and longpetted Master Harry\\nsent to school after his brothers was now living in her deserted nursery\\nto mend stockings and dress all the blains and bruises she could\\nget near her and who consequently was only too happy in being\\nallowed to go and help nurse dear Miss Louisa  Vague wishes of\\ngetting Sarah thither had occurred before to Mrs Musgrove and Henrietta\\nbut without Anne it would hardly have been resolved on\\nand found practicable so soon\\n\\nThey were indebted the next day to Charles Hayter for all\\nthe minute knowledge of Louisa which it was so essential to obtain\\nevery twentyfour hours  He made it his business to go to Lyme\\nand his account was still encouraging  The intervals of sense\\nand consciousness were believed to be stronger  Every report agreed\\nin Captain Wentworths appearing fixed in Lyme\\n\\nAnne was to leave them on the morrow an event which they all dreaded\\nWhat should they do without her  They were wretched comforters\\nfor one another  And so much was said in this way that Anne thought\\nshe could not do better than impart among them the general inclination\\nto which she was privy and persuaded them all to go to Lyme at once\\nShe had little difficulty it was soon determined that they would go\\ngo tomorrow fix themselves at the inn or get into lodgings\\nas it suited and there remain till dear Louisa could be moved\\nThey must be taking off some trouble from the good people she was with\\nthey might at least relieve Mrs Harville from the care of her own children\\nand in short they were so happy in the decision that Anne was delighted\\nwith what she had done and felt that she could not spend her\\nlast morning at Uppercross better than in assisting their preparations\\nand sending them off at an early hour though her being left\\nto the solitary range of the house was the consequence\\n\\nShe was the last excepting the little boys at the cottage\\nshe was the very last the only remaining one of all that had filled\\nand animated both houses of all that had given Uppercross\\nits cheerful character  A few days had made a change indeed\\n\\nIf Louisa recovered it would all be well again  More than\\nformer happiness would be restored  There could not be a doubt\\nto her mind there was none of what would follow her recovery\\nA few months hence and the room now so deserted occupied but by\\nher silent pensive self might be filled again with all that was happy\\nand gay all that was glowing and bright in prosperous love\\nall that was most unlike Anne Elliot\\n\\nAn hours complete leisure for such reflections as these\\non a dark November day a small thick rain almost blotting out\\nthe very few objects ever to be discerned from the windows was enough\\nto make the sound of Lady Russells carriage exceedingly welcome\\nand yet though desirous to be gone she could not quit the Mansion House\\nor look an adieu to the Cottage with its black dripping and\\ncomfortless veranda or even notice through the misty glasses\\nthe last humble tenements of the village without a saddened heart\\nScenes had passed in Uppercross which made it precious\\nIt stood the record of many sensations of pain once severe\\nbut now softened and of some instances of relenting feeling\\nsome breathings of friendship and reconciliation which could\\nnever be looked for again and which could never cease to be dear\\nShe left it all behind her all but the recollection that\\nsuch things had been\\n\\nAnne had never entered Kellynch since her quitting Lady Russells house\\nin September  It had not been necessary and the few occasions of\\nits being possible for her to go to the Hall she had contrived to evade\\nand escape from  Her first return was to resume her place in the modern\\nand elegant apartments of the Lodge and to gladden the eyes\\nof its mistress\\n\\nThere was some anxiety mixed with Lady Russells joy in meeting her\\nShe knew who had been frequenting Uppercross  But happily\\neither Anne was improved in plumpness and looks or Lady Russell\\nfancied her so and Anne in receiving her compliments on the occasion\\nhad the amusement of connecting them with the silent admiration\\nof her cousin and of hoping that she was to be blessed with\\na second spring of youth and beauty\\n\\nWhen they came to converse she was soon sensible of some mental change\\nThe subjects of which her heart had been full on leaving Kellynch\\nand which she had felt slighted and been compelled to smother\\namong the Musgroves were now become but of secondary interest\\nShe had lately lost sight even of her father and sister and Bath\\nTheir concerns had been sunk under those of Uppercross\\nand when Lady Russell reverted to their former hopes and fears\\nand spoke her satisfaction in the house in Camden Place\\nwhich had been taken and her regret that Mrs Clay should still\\nbe with them Anne would have been ashamed to have it known\\nhow much more she was thinking of Lyme and Louisa Musgrove\\nand all her acquaintance there how much more interesting to her\\nwas the home and the friendship of the Harvilles and Captain Benwick\\nthan her own fathers house in Camden Place or her own sisters intimacy\\nwith Mrs Clay  She was actually forced to exert herself\\nto meet Lady Russell with anything like the appearance of equal solicitude\\non topics which had by nature the first claim on her\\n\\nThere was a little awkwardness at first in their discourse\\non another subject  They must speak of the accident at Lyme\\nLady Russell had not been arrived five minutes the day before\\nwhen a full account of the whole had burst on her but still it must\\nbe talked of she must make enquiries she must regret the imprudence\\nlament the result and Captain Wentworths name must be mentioned by both\\nAnne was conscious of not doing it so well as Lady Russell\\nShe could not speak the name and look straight forward to\\nLady Russells eye till she had adopted the expedient of telling her\\nbriefly what she thought of the attachment between him and Louisa\\nWhen this was told his name distressed her no longer\\n\\nLady Russell had only to listen composedly and wish them happy\\nbut internally her heart revelled in angry pleasure in pleased contempt\\nthat the man who at twentythree had seemed to understand somewhat\\nof the value of an Anne Elliot should eight years afterwards\\nbe charmed by a Louisa Musgrove\\n\\nThe first three or four days passed most quietly with no circumstance\\nto mark them excepting the receipt of a note or two from Lyme\\nwhich found their way to Anne she could not tell how and brought\\na rather improving account of Louisa  At the end of that period\\nLady Russells politeness could repose no longer and the fainter\\nselfthreatenings of the past became in a decided tone\\nI must call on Mrs Croft I really must call upon her soon\\nAnne have you courage to go with me and pay a visit in that house\\nIt will be some trial to us both\\n\\nAnne did not shrink from it on the contrary she truly felt as she said\\nin observing\\n\\nI think you are very likely to suffer the most of the two\\nyour feelings are less reconciled to the change than mine\\nBy remaining in the neighbourhood I am become inured to it\\n\\nShe could have said more on the subject for she had in fact\\nso high an opinion of the Crofts and considered her father\\nso very fortunate in his tenants felt the parish to be so sure\\nof a good example and the poor of the best attention and relief\\nthat however sorry and ashamed for the necessity of the removal\\nshe could not but in conscience feel that they were gone\\nwho deserved not to stay and that Kellynch Hall had passed\\ninto better hands than its owners  These convictions must unquestionably\\nhave their own pain and severe was its kind but they precluded\\nthat pain which Lady Russell would suffer in entering the house again\\nand returning through the wellknown apartments\\n\\nIn such moments Anne had no power of saying to herself\\nThese rooms ought to belong only to us  Oh how fallen\\nin their destination  How unworthily occupied  An ancient family\\nto be so driven away  Strangers filling their place\\nNo except when she thought of her mother and remembered where\\nshe had been used to sit and preside she had no sigh of that description\\nto heave\\n\\nMrs Croft always met her with a kindness which gave her the pleasure\\nof fancying herself a favourite and on the present occasion\\nreceiving her in that house there was particular attention\\n\\nThe sad accident at Lyme was soon the prevailing topic\\nand on comparing their latest accounts of the invalid it appeared\\nthat each lady dated her intelligence from the same hour of yestermorn\\nthat Captain Wentworth had been in Kellynch yesterday the first time\\nsince the accident had brought Anne the last note which she had\\nnot been able to trace the exact steps of had staid a few hours\\nand then returned again to Lyme and without any present intention\\nof quitting it any more  He had enquired after her she found\\nparticularly had expressed his hope of Miss Elliots not being\\nthe worse for her exertions and had spoken of those exertions as great\\nThis was handsome and gave her more pleasure than almost anything else\\ncould have done\\n\\nAs to the sad catastrophe itself it could be canvassed only in one style\\nby a couple of steady sensible women whose judgements had to work\\non ascertained events and it was perfectly decided that it had been\\nthe consequence of much thoughtlessness and much imprudence\\nthat its effects were most alarming and that it was frightful to think\\nhow long Miss Musgroves recovery might yet be doubtful and how liable\\nshe would still remain to suffer from the concussion hereafter\\nThe Admiral wound it up summarily by exclaiming\\n\\nAy a very bad business indeed  A new sort of way this\\nfor a young fellow to be making love by breaking his mistresss head\\nis not it Miss Elliot  This is breaking a head and giving a plaster\\ntruly\\n\\nAdmiral Crofts manners were not quite of the tone to suit Lady Russell\\nbut they delighted Anne  His goodness of heart and simplicity\\nof character were irresistible\\n\\nNow this must be very bad for you said he suddenly rousing from\\na little reverie to be coming and finding us here  I had not\\nrecollected it before I declare but it must be very bad\\nBut now do not stand upon ceremony  Get up and go over all the rooms\\nin the house if you like it\\n\\nAnother time Sir I thank you not now\\n\\nWell whenever it suits you  You can slip in from the shrubbery\\nat any time and there you will find we keep our umbrellas hanging up\\nby that door  A good place is not it  But checking himself\\nyou will not think it a good place for yours were always kept\\nin the butlers room  Ay so it always is I believe\\nOne mans ways may be as good as anothers but we all like our own best\\nAnd so you must judge for yourself whether it would be better for you\\nto go about the house or not\\n\\nAnne finding she might decline it did so very gratefully\\n\\nWe have made very few changes either continued the Admiral\\nafter thinking a moment  Very few  We told you about the laundrydoor\\nat Uppercross  That has been a very great improvement\\nThe wonder was how any family upon earth could bear with the inconvenience\\nof its opening as it did so long  You will tell Sir Walter\\nwhat we have done and that Mr Shepherd thinks it the greatest improvement\\nthe house ever had  Indeed I must do ourselves the justice to say\\nthat the few alterations we have made have been all very much\\nfor the better  My wife should have the credit of them however\\nI have done very little besides sending away some of the large\\nlookingglasses from my dressingroom which was your fathers\\nA very good man and very much the gentleman I am sure\\nbut I should think Miss Elliot looking with serious reflection\\nI should think he must be rather a dressy man for his time of life\\nSuch a number of lookingglasses oh Lord there was no getting away\\nfrom ones self  So I got Sophy to lend me a hand and we soon\\nshifted their quarters and now I am quite snug with my\\nlittle shaving glass in one corner and another great thing\\nthat I never go near\\n\\nAnne amused in spite of herself was rather distressed for an answer\\nand the Admiral fearing he might not have been civil enough\\ntook up the subject again to say\\n\\nThe next time you write to your good father Miss Elliot\\npray give him my compliments and Mrs Crofts and say that we are\\nsettled here quite to our liking and have no fault at all to find\\nwith the place  The breakfastroom chimney smokes a little\\nI grant you but it is only when the wind is due north and blows hard\\nwhich may not happen three times a winter  And take it altogether\\nnow that we have been into most of the houses hereabouts and can judge\\nthere is not one that we like better than this  Pray say so\\nwith my compliments  He will be glad to hear it\\n\\nLady Russell and Mrs Croft were very well pleased with each other\\nbut the acquaintance which this visit began was fated not to proceed\\nfar at present for when it was returned the Crofts announced\\nthemselves to be going away for a few weeks to visit their connexions\\nin the north of the county and probably might not be at home again\\nbefore Lady Russell would be removing to Bath\\n\\nSo ended all danger to Anne of meeting Captain Wentworth at Kellynch Hall\\nor of seeing him in company with her friend  Everything was safe enough\\nand she smiled over the many anxious feelings she had wasted\\non the subject\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 14\\n\\n\\nThough Charles and Mary had remained at Lyme much longer after\\nMr and Mrs Musgroves going than Anne conceived they could have been\\nat all wanted they were yet the first of the family to be at home again\\nand as soon as possible after their return to Uppercross\\nthey drove over to the Lodge  They had left Louisa beginning to sit up\\nbut her head though clear was exceedingly weak and her nerves\\nsusceptible to the highest extreme of tenderness and though\\nshe might be pronounced to be altogether doing very well\\nit was still impossible to say when she might be able to bear\\nthe removal home and her father and mother who must return\\nin time to receive their younger children for the Christmas holidays\\nhad hardly a hope of being allowed to bring her with them\\n\\nThey had been all in lodgings together  Mrs Musgrove had\\ngot Mrs Harvilles children away as much as she could every possible\\nsupply from Uppercross had been furnished to lighten the inconvenience\\nto the Harvilles while the Harvilles had been wanting them\\nto come to dinner every day and in short it seemed to have been\\nonly a struggle on each side as to which should be most disinterested\\nand hospitable\\n\\nMary had had her evils but upon the whole as was evident\\nby her staying so long she had found more to enjoy than to suffer\\nCharles Hayter had been at Lyme oftener than suited her and when\\nthey dined with the Harvilles there had been only a maidservant to wait\\nand at first Mrs Harville had always given Mrs Musgrove precedence\\nbut then she had received so very handsome an apology from her\\non finding out whose daughter she was and there had been so much\\ngoing on every day there had been so many walks between their lodgings\\nand the Harvilles and she had got books from the library\\nand changed them so often that the balance had certainly been\\nmuch in favour of Lyme  She had been taken to Charmouth too\\nand she had bathed and she had gone to church and there were a great many\\nmore people to look at in the church at Lyme than at Uppercross\\nand all this joined to the sense of being so very useful\\nhad made really an agreeable fortnight\\n\\nAnne enquired after Captain Benwick Marys face was clouded directly\\nCharles laughed\\n\\nOh Captain Benwick is very well I believe but he is\\na very odd young man  I do not know what he would be at\\nWe asked him to come home with us for a day or two  Charles undertook\\nto give him some shooting and he seemed quite delighted and for my part\\nI thought it was all settled when behold on Tuesday night\\nhe made a very awkward sort of excuse he never shot and he had\\nbeen quite misunderstood and he had promised this and he had\\npromised that and the end of it was I found that he did not mean to come\\nI suppose he was afraid of finding it dull but upon my word\\nI should have thought we were lively enough at the Cottage\\nfor such a heartbroken man as Captain Benwick\\n\\nCharles laughed again and said Now Mary you know very well\\nhow it really was  It was all your doing turning to Anne\\nHe fancied that if he went with us he should find you close by\\nhe fancied everybody to be living in Uppercross and when he discovered\\nthat Lady Russell lived three miles off his heart failed him\\nand he had not courage to come  That is the fact upon my honour\\nMary knows it is\\n\\nBut Mary did not give into it very graciously whether from\\nnot considering Captain Benwick entitled by birth and situation\\nto be in love with an Elliot or from not wanting to believe\\nAnne a greater attraction to Uppercross than herself must be\\nleft to be guessed  Annes goodwill however was not to be lessened\\nby what she heard  She boldly acknowledged herself flattered\\nand continued her enquiries\\n\\nOh he talks of you cried Charles in such terms\\nMary interrupted him I declare Charles I never heard him\\nmention Anne twice all the time I was there  I declare Anne\\nhe never talks of you at all\\n\\nNo admitted Charles I do not know that he ever does in a general\\nway but however it is a very clear thing that he admires you exceedingly\\nHis head is full of some books that he is reading upon your recommendation\\nand he wants to talk to you about them he has found out something or other\\nin one of them which he thinksoh I cannot pretend to remember it\\nbut it was something very fineI overheard him telling Henrietta\\nall about it and then Miss Elliot was spoken of in the highest terms\\nNow Mary I declare it was so I heard it myself and you were\\nin the other room  Elegance sweetness beauty Oh there was no end\\nof Miss Elliots charms\\n\\nAnd I am sure cried Mary warmly it was a very little to his credit\\nif he did  Miss Harville only died last June  Such a heart\\nis very little worth having is it Lady Russell  I am sure\\nyou will agree with me\\n\\nI must see Captain Benwick before I decide said Lady Russell smiling\\n\\nAnd that you are very likely to do very soon I can tell you maam\\nsaid Charles  Though he had not nerves for coming away with us\\nand setting off again afterwards to pay a formal visit here\\nhe will make his way over to Kellynch one day by himself\\nyou may depend on it  I told him the distance and the road\\nand I told him of the churchs being so very well worth seeing\\nfor as he has a taste for those sort of things I thought that would\\nbe a good excuse and he listened with all his understanding and soul\\nand I am sure from his manner that you will have him calling here soon\\nSo I give you notice Lady Russell\\n\\nAny acquaintance of Annes will always be welcome to me\\nwas Lady Russells kind answer\\n\\nOh as to being Annes acquaintance said Mary I think he is rather\\nmy acquaintance for I have been seeing him every day this last fortnight\\n\\nWell as your joint acquaintance then I shall be very happy\\nto see Captain Benwick\\n\\nYou will not find anything very agreeable in him I assure you maam\\nHe is one of the dullest young men that ever lived  He has walked with me\\nsometimes from one end of the sands to the other without saying a word\\nHe is not at all a wellbred young man  I am sure you will not like him\\n\\nThere we differ Mary said Anne  I think Lady Russell would like him\\nI think she would be so much pleased with his mind that she would\\nvery soon see no deficiency in his manner\\n\\nSo do I Anne said Charles  I am sure Lady Russell would like him\\nHe is just Lady Russells sort  Give him a book and he will\\nread all day long\\n\\nYes that he will exclaimed Mary tauntingly  He will sit poring\\nover his book and not know when a person speaks to him or when one\\ndrops ones scissors or anything that happens  Do you think\\nLady Russell would like that\\n\\nLady Russell could not help laughing  Upon my word said she\\nI should not have supposed that my opinion of any one could have\\nadmitted of such difference of conjecture steady and matter of fact\\nas I may call myself  I have really a curiosity to see the person\\nwho can give occasion to such directly opposite notions\\nI wish he may be induced to call here  And when he does Mary\\nyou may depend upon hearing my opinion but I am determined\\nnot to judge him beforehand\\n\\nYou will not like him I will answer for it\\n\\nLady Russell began talking of something else  Mary spoke with animation\\nof their meeting with or rather missing Mr Elliot so extraordinarily\\n\\nHe is a man said Lady Russell whom I have no wish to see\\nHis declining to be on cordial terms with the head of his family\\nhas left a very strong impression in his disfavour with me\\n\\nThis decision checked Marys eagerness and stopped her short\\nin the midst of the Elliot countenance\\n\\nWith regard to Captain Wentworth though Anne hazarded no enquiries\\nthere was voluntary communication sufficient  His spirits had been\\ngreatly recovering lately as might be expected  As Louisa improved\\nhe had improved and he was now quite a different creature\\nfrom what he had been the first week  He had not seen Louisa\\nand was so extremely fearful of any ill consequence to her\\nfrom an interview that he did not press for it at all and\\non the contrary seemed to have a plan of going away for a week\\nor ten days till her head was stronger  He had talked of going\\ndown to Plymouth for a week and wanted to persuade Captain Benwick\\nto go with him but as Charles maintained to the last Captain Benwick\\nseemed much more disposed to ride over to Kellynch\\n\\nThere can be no doubt that Lady Russell and Anne were both\\noccasionally thinking of Captain Benwick from this time\\nLady Russell could not hear the doorbell without feeling that it might\\nbe his herald nor could Anne return from any stroll of solitary indulgence\\nin her fathers grounds or any visit of charity in the village\\nwithout wondering whether she might see him or hear of him\\nCaptain Benwick came not however  He was either less disposed for it\\nthan Charles had imagined or he was too shy and after giving him\\na weeks indulgence Lady Russell determined him to be unworthy\\nof the interest which he had been beginning to excite\\n\\nThe Musgroves came back to receive their happy boys and girls from school\\nbringing with them Mrs Harvilles little children to improve the noise\\nof Uppercross and lessen that of Lyme  Henrietta remained with Louisa\\nbut all the rest of the family were again in their usual quarters\\n\\nLady Russell and Anne paid their compliments to them once\\nwhen Anne could not but feel that Uppercross was already quite alive again\\nThough neither Henrietta nor Louisa nor Charles Hayter\\nnor Captain Wentworth were there the room presented as strong a contrast\\nas could be wished to the last state she had seen it in\\n\\nImmediately surrounding Mrs Musgrove were the little Harvilles\\nwhom she was sedulously guarding from the tyranny of the two children\\nfrom the Cottage expressly arrived to amuse them  On one side\\nwas a table occupied by some chattering girls cutting up silk\\nand gold paper and on the other were tressels and trays\\nbending under the weight of brawn and cold pies where riotous boys\\nwere holding high revel the whole completed by a roaring Christmas fire\\nwhich seemed determined to be heard in spite of all the noise\\nof the others  Charles and Mary also came in of course\\nduring their visit and Mr Musgrove made a point of paying his respects\\nto Lady Russell and sat down close to her for ten minutes\\ntalking with a very raised voice but from the clamour of the children\\non his knees generally in vain  It was a fine familypiece\\n\\nAnne judging from her own temperament would have deemed\\nsuch a domestic hurricane a bad restorative of the nerves\\nwhich Louisas illness must have so greatly shaken  But Mrs Musgrove\\nwho got Anne near her on purpose to thank her most cordially\\nagain and again for all her attentions to them concluded\\na short recapitulation of what she had suffered herself by observing\\nwith a happy glance round the room that after all she had gone through\\nnothing was so likely to do her good as a little quiet cheerfulness\\nat home\\n\\nLouisa was now recovering apace  Her mother could even think of her\\nbeing able to join their party at home before her brothers and sisters\\nwent to school again  The Harvilles had promised to come with her\\nand stay at Uppercross whenever she returned  Captain Wentworth was gone\\nfor the present to see his brother in Shropshire\\n\\nI hope I shall remember in future said Lady Russell as soon as\\nthey were reseated in the carriage not to call at Uppercross\\nin the Christmas holidays\\n\\nEverybody has their taste in noises as well as in other matters\\nand sounds are quite innoxious or most distressing by their sort\\nrather than their quantity  When Lady Russell not long afterwards\\nwas entering Bath on a wet afternoon and driving through\\nthe long course of streets from the Old Bridge to Camden Place\\namidst the dash of other carriages the heavy rumble of carts and drays\\nthe bawling of newspapermen muffinmen and milkmen and the ceaseless\\nclink of pattens she made no complaint  No these were noises\\nwhich belonged to the winter pleasures her spirits rose\\nunder their influence and like Mrs Musgrove she was feeling\\nthough not saying that after being long in the country nothing could be\\nso good for her as a little quiet cheerfulness\\n\\nAnne did not share these feelings  She persisted in a very determined\\nthough very silent disinclination for Bath caught the first dim view\\nof the extensive buildings smoking in rain without any wish\\nof seeing them better felt their progress through the streets to be\\nhowever disagreeable yet too rapid for who would be glad to see her\\nwhen she arrived  And looked back with fond regret to the bustles\\nof Uppercross and the seclusion of Kellynch\\n\\nElizabeths last letter had communicated a piece of news of some interest\\nMr Elliot was in Bath  He had called in Camden Place had called\\na second time a third had been pointedly attentive  If Elizabeth\\nand her father did not deceive themselves had been taking much pains\\nto seek the acquaintance and proclaim the value of the connection\\nas he had formerly taken pains to shew neglect  This was very wonderful\\nif it were true and Lady Russell was in a state of very agreeable\\ncuriosity and perplexity about Mr Elliot already recanting the sentiment\\nshe had so lately expressed to Mary of his being a man whom she had\\nno wish to see  She had a great wish to see him  If he really sought\\nto reconcile himself like a dutiful branch he must be forgiven\\nfor having dismembered himself from the paternal tree\\n\\nAnne was not animated to an equal pitch by the circumstance\\nbut she felt that she would rather see Mr Elliot again than not\\nwhich was more than she could say for many other persons in Bath\\n\\nShe was put down in Camden Place and Lady Russell then drove\\nto her own lodgings in Rivers Street\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 15\\n\\n\\nSir Walter had taken a very good house in Camden Place\\na lofty dignified situation such as becomes a man of consequence\\nand both he and Elizabeth were settled there much to their satisfaction\\n\\nAnne entered it with a sinking heart anticipating an imprisonment\\nof many months and anxiously saying to herself Oh when shall I\\nleave you again  A degree of unexpected cordiality however\\nin the welcome she received did her good  Her father and sister\\nwere glad to see her for the sake of shewing her the house and furniture\\nand met her with kindness  Her making a fourth when they\\nsat down to dinner was noticed as an advantage\\n\\nMrs Clay was very pleasant and very smiling but her courtesies and smiles\\nwere more a matter of course  Anne had always felt that she would\\npretend what was proper on her arrival but the complaisance of the others\\nwas unlooked for  They were evidently in excellent spirits\\nand she was soon to listen to the causes  They had no inclination\\nto listen to her  After laying out for some compliments of being\\ndeeply regretted in their old neighbourhood which Anne could not pay\\nthey had only a few faint enquiries to make before the talk must be\\nall their own  Uppercross excited no interest Kellynch very little\\nit was all Bath\\n\\nThey had the pleasure of assuring her that Bath more than answered\\ntheir expectations in every respect  Their house was undoubtedly\\nthe best in Camden Place their drawingrooms had many decided advantages\\nover all the others which they had either seen or heard of\\nand the superiority was not less in the style of the fittingup\\nor the taste of the furniture  Their acquaintance was\\nexceedingly sought after  Everybody was wanting to visit them\\nThey had drawn back from many introductions and still were\\nperpetually having cards left by people of whom they knew nothing\\n\\nHere were funds of enjoyment  Could Anne wonder that her father\\nand sister were happy  She might not wonder but she must sigh\\nthat her father should feel no degradation in his change should see\\nnothing to regret in the duties and dignity of the resident landholder\\nshould find so much to be vain of in the littlenesses of a town\\nand she must sigh and smile and wonder too as Elizabeth threw open\\nthe foldingdoors and walked with exultation from one drawingroom\\nto the other boasting of their space at the possibility of that woman\\nwho had been mistress of Kellynch Hall finding extent to be proud of\\nbetween two walls perhaps thirty feet asunder\\n\\nBut this was not all which they had to make them happy\\nThey had Mr Elliot too  Anne had a great deal to hear of Mr Elliot\\nHe was not only pardoned they were delighted with him\\nHe had been in Bath about a fortnight he had passed through Bath\\nin November in his way to London when the intelligence of\\nSir Walters being settled there had of course reached him\\nthough only twentyfour hours in the place but he had not been able\\nto avail himself of it but he had now been a fortnight in Bath\\nand his first object on arriving had been to leave his card\\nin Camden Place following it up by such assiduous endeavours to meet\\nand when they did meet by such great openness of conduct\\nsuch readiness to apologize for the past such solicitude to be received\\nas a relation again that their former good understanding\\nwas completely reestablished\\n\\nThey had not a fault to find in him  He had explained away\\nall the appearance of neglect on his own side  It had originated\\nin misapprehension entirely  He had never had an idea of\\nthrowing himself off he had feared that he was thrown off\\nbut knew not why and delicacy had kept him silent  Upon the hint\\nof having spoken disrespectfully or carelessly of the family\\nand the family honours he was quite indignant  He who had ever boasted\\nof being an Elliot and whose feelings as to connection\\nwere only too strict to suit the unfeudal tone of the present day\\nHe was astonished indeed but his character and general conduct\\nmust refute it  He could refer Sir Walter to all who knew him\\nand certainly the pains he had been taking on this the first opportunity\\nof reconciliation to be restored to the footing of a relation\\nand heirpresumptive was a strong proof of his opinions on the subject\\n\\nThe circumstances of his marriage too were found to admit of\\nmuch extenuation  This was an article not to be entered on by himself\\nbut a very intimate friend of his a Colonel Wallis a highly\\nrespectable man perfectly the gentleman and not an illlooking man\\nSir Walter added who was living in very good style in Marlborough\\nBuildings and had at his own particular request been admitted\\nto their acquaintance through Mr Elliot had mentioned one or two things\\nrelative to the marriage which made a material difference\\nin the discredit of it\\n\\nColonel Wallis had known Mr Elliot long had been well acquainted\\nalso with his wife had perfectly understood the whole story\\nShe was certainly not a woman of family but well educated\\naccomplished rich and excessively in love with his friend\\nThere had been the charm  She had sought him  Without that attraction\\nnot all her money would have tempted Elliot and Sir Walter was\\nmoreover assured of her having been a very fine woman\\nHere was a great deal to soften the business  A very fine woman\\nwith a large fortune in love with him  Sir Walter seemed to admit it\\nas complete apology and though Elizabeth could not see the circumstance\\nin quite so favourable a light she allowed it be a great extenuation\\n\\nMr Elliot had called repeatedly had dined with them once\\nevidently delighted by the distinction of being asked for they\\ngave no dinners in general delighted in short by every proof\\nof cousinly notice and placing his whole happiness in being\\non intimate terms in Camden Place\\n\\nAnne listened but without quite understanding it  Allowances\\nlarge allowances she knew must be made for the ideas of those who spoke\\nShe heard it all under embellishment  All that sounded extravagant\\nor irrational in the progress of the reconciliation might have no origin\\nbut in the language of the relators  Still however she had\\nthe sensation of there being something more than immediately appeared\\nin Mr Elliots wishing after an interval of so many years\\nto be well received by them  In a worldly view he had nothing to gain\\nby being on terms with Sir Walter nothing to risk by a state of variance\\nIn all probability he was already the richer of the two\\nand the Kellynch estate would as surely be his hereafter as the title\\nA sensible man and he had looked like a very sensible man\\nwhy should it be an object to him  She could only offer one solution\\nit was perhaps for Elizabeths sake  There might really have been\\na liking formerly though convenience and accident had drawn him\\na different way and now that he could afford to please himself\\nhe might mean to pay his addresses to her  Elizabeth was certainly\\nvery handsome with wellbred elegant manners and her character\\nmight never have been penetrated by Mr Elliot knowing her but in public\\nand when very young himself  How her temper and understanding\\nmight bear the investigation of his present keener time of life\\nwas another concern and rather a fearful one  Most earnestly did she wish\\nthat he might not be too nice or too observant if Elizabeth\\nwere his object and that Elizabeth was disposed to believe herself so\\nand that her friend Mrs Clay was encouraging the idea seemed apparent\\nby a glance or two between them while Mr Elliots frequent visits\\nwere talked of\\n\\nAnne mentioned the glimpses she had had of him at Lyme but without\\nbeing much attended to  Oh yes perhaps it had been Mr Elliot\\nThey did not know  It might be him perhaps  They could not listen\\nto her description of him  They were describing him themselves\\nSir Walter especially  He did justice to his very gentlemanlike\\nappearance his air of elegance and fashion his good shaped face\\nhis sensible eye but at the same time must lament his being\\nvery much underhung a defect which time seemed to have increased\\nnor could he pretend to say that ten years had not altered\\nalmost every feature for the worse  Mr Elliot appeared to think\\nthat he Sir Walter was looking exactly as he had done when\\nthey last parted but Sir Walter had not been able to return\\nthe compliment entirely which had embarrassed him  He did not mean\\nto complain however  Mr Elliot was better to look at than most men\\nand he had no objection to being seen with him anywhere\\n\\nMr Elliot and his friends in Marlborough Buildings were talked of\\nthe whole evening  Colonel Wallis had been so impatient to be\\nintroduced to them and Mr Elliot so anxious that he should\\nand there was a Mrs Wallis at present known only to them by description\\nas she was in daily expectation of her confinement but Mr Elliot\\nspoke of her as a most charming woman quite worthy of being known\\nin Camden Place and as soon as she recovered they were to be acquainted\\nSir Walter thought much of Mrs Wallis she was said to be\\nan excessively pretty woman beautiful  He longed to see her\\nHe hoped she might make some amends for the many very plain faces\\nhe was continually passing in the streets  The worst of Bath was\\nthe number of its plain women  He did not mean to say that there were\\nno pretty women but the number of the plain was out of all proportion\\nHe had frequently observed as he walked that one handsome face\\nwould be followed by thirty or fiveandthirty frights and once\\nas he had stood in a shop on Bond Street he had counted\\neightyseven women go by one after another without there being\\na tolerable face among them  It had been a frosty morning\\nto be sure a sharp frost which hardly one woman in a thousand\\ncould stand the test of  But still there certainly were\\na dreadful multitude of ugly women in Bath and as for the men\\nthey were infinitely worse  Such scarecrows as the streets were full of\\nIt was evident how little the women were used to the sight of anything\\ntolerable by the effect which a man of decent appearance produced\\nHe had never walked anywhere arminarm with Colonel Wallis\\nwho was a fine military figure though sandyhaired without observing\\nthat every womans eye was upon him every womans eye was sure to be\\nupon Colonel Wallis  Modest Sir Walter  He was not allowed\\nto escape however  His daughter and Mrs Clay united in hinting\\nthat Colonel Walliss companion might have as good a figure\\nas Colonel Wallis and certainly was not sandyhaired\\n\\nHow is Mary looking said Sir Walter in the height of his good humour\\nThe last time I saw her she had a red nose but I hope that may not\\nhappen every day\\n\\nOh no that must have been quite accidental  In general she has been\\nin very good health and very good looks since Michaelmas\\n\\nIf I thought it would not tempt her to go out in sharp winds\\nand grow coarse I would send her a new hat and pelisse\\n\\nAnne was considering whether she should venture to suggest that a gown\\nor a cap would not be liable to any such misuse when a knock at the door\\nsuspended everything  A knock at the door and so late\\nIt was ten oclock  Could it be Mr Elliot  They knew he was to dine\\nin Lansdown Crescent  It was possible that he might stop in his way home\\nto ask them how they did  They could think of no one else\\nMrs Clay decidedly thought it Mr Elliots knock  Mrs Clay was right\\nWith all the state which a butler and footboy could give\\nMr Elliot was ushered into the room\\n\\nIt was the same the very same man with no difference but of dress\\nAnne drew a little back while the others received his compliments\\nand her sister his apologies for calling at so unusual an hour\\nbut he could not be so near without wishing to know that neither she\\nnor her friend had taken cold the day before c c which was\\nall as politely done and as politely taken as possible but her part\\nmust follow then  Sir Walter talked of his youngest daughter\\nMr Elliot must give him leave to present him to his youngest daughter\\nthere was no occasion for remembering Mary and Anne smiling and\\nblushing very becomingly shewed to Mr Elliot the pretty features\\nwhich he had by no means forgotten and instantly saw with amusement\\nat his little start of surprise that he had not been at all aware\\nof who she was  He looked completely astonished but not more astonished\\nthan pleased his eyes brightened and with the most perfect alacrity\\nhe welcomed the relationship alluded to the past and entreated\\nto be received as an acquaintance already  He was quite as goodlooking\\nas he had appeared at Lyme his countenance improved by speaking\\nand his manners were so exactly what they ought to be so polished\\nso easy so particularly agreeable that she could compare them\\nin excellence to only one persons manners  They were not the same\\nbut they were perhaps equally good\\n\\nHe sat down with them and improved their conversation very much\\nThere could be no doubt of his being a sensible man  Ten minutes\\nwere enough to certify that  His tone his expressions\\nhis choice of subject his knowing where to stop it was all\\nthe operation of a sensible discerning mind  As soon as he could\\nhe began to talk to her of Lyme wanting to compare opinions\\nrespecting the place but especially wanting to speak of the circumstance\\nof their happening to be guests in the same inn at the same time\\nto give his own route understand something of hers and regret that\\nhe should have lost such an opportunity of paying his respects to her\\nShe gave him a short account of her party and business at Lyme\\nHis regret increased as he listened  He had spent his whole\\nsolitary evening in the room adjoining theirs had heard voices\\nmirth continually thought they must be a most delightful set of people\\nlonged to be with them but certainly without the smallest suspicion\\nof his possessing the shadow of a right to introduce himself\\nIf he had but asked who the party were  The name of Musgrove would\\nhave told him enough  Well it would serve to cure him of\\nan absurd practice of never asking a question at an inn\\nwhich he had adopted when quite a young man on the principal\\nof its being very ungenteel to be curious\\n\\nThe notions of a young man of one or two and twenty said he\\nas to what is necessary in manners to make him quite the thing\\nare more absurd I believe than those of any other set of beings\\nin the world  The folly of the means they often employ\\nis only to be equalled by the folly of what they have in view\\n\\nBut he must not be addressing his reflections to Anne alone\\nhe knew it he was soon diffused again among the others\\nand it was only at intervals that he could return to Lyme\\n\\nHis enquiries however produced at length an account of the scene\\nshe had been engaged in there soon after his leaving the place\\nHaving alluded to an accident  he must hear the whole\\nWhen he questioned Sir Walter and Elizabeth began to question also\\nbut the difference in their manner of doing it could not be unfelt\\nShe could only compare Mr Elliot to Lady Russell in the wish\\nof really comprehending what had passed and in the degree of concern\\nfor what she must have suffered in witnessing it\\n\\nHe staid an hour with them  The elegant little clock on the mantel\\npiece had struck eleven with its silver sounds and the watchman\\nwas beginning to be heard at a distance telling the same tale\\nbefore Mr Elliot or any of them seemed to feel that he had been there long\\n\\nAnne could not have supposed it possible that her first evening in\\nCamden Place could have passed so well\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 16\\n\\n\\nThere was one point which Anne on returning to her family\\nwould have been more thankful to ascertain even than Mr Elliots\\nbeing in love with Elizabeth which was her fathers not being\\nin love with Mrs Clay and she was very far from easy about it\\nwhen she had been at home a few hours  On going down to breakfast\\nthe next morning she found there had just been a decent pretence\\non the ladys side of meaning to leave them  She could imagine Mrs Clay\\nto have said that now Miss Anne was come she could not suppose herself\\nat all wanted for Elizabeth was replying in a sort of whisper\\nThat must not be any reason indeed  I assure you I feel it none\\nShe is nothing to me compared with you  and she was in full time\\nto hear her father say My dear madam this must not be  As yet\\nyou have seen nothing of Bath  You have been here only to be useful\\nYou must not run away from us now  You must stay to be acquainted\\nwith Mrs Wallis the beautiful Mrs Wallis  To your fine mind\\nI well know the sight of beauty is a real gratification\\n\\nHe spoke and looked so much in earnest that Anne was not surprised\\nto see Mrs Clay stealing a glance at Elizabeth and herself\\nHer countenance perhaps might express some watchfulness\\nbut the praise of the fine mind did not appear to excite a thought\\nin her sister  The lady could not but yield to such joint entreaties\\nand promise to stay\\n\\nIn the course of the same morning Anne and her father chancing to be\\nalone together he began to compliment her on her improved looks\\nhe thought her less thin in her person in her cheeks her skin\\nher complexion greatly improved clearer fresher  Had she been\\nusing any thing in particular  No nothing  Merely Gowland\\nhe supposed  No nothing at all  Ha he was surprised at that\\nand added certainly you cannot do better than to continue as you are\\nyou cannot be better than well or I should recommend Gowland\\nthe constant use of Gowland during the spring months  Mrs Clay has been\\nusing it at my recommendation and you see what it has done for her\\nYou see how it has carried away her freckles\\n\\nIf Elizabeth could but have heard this  Such personal praise\\nmight have struck her especially as it did not appear to Anne\\nthat the freckles were at all lessened  But everything must\\ntake its chance  The evil of a marriage would be much diminished\\nif Elizabeth were also to marry  As for herself she might always\\ncommand a home with Lady Russell\\n\\nLady Russells composed mind and polite manners were put to some trial\\non this point in her intercourse in Camden Place  The sight of Mrs Clay\\nin such favour and of Anne so overlooked was a perpetual provocation\\nto her there and vexed her as much when she was away as a person in Bath\\nwho drinks the water gets all the new publications and has\\na very large acquaintance has time to be vexed\\n\\nAs Mr Elliot became known to her she grew more charitable\\nor more indifferent towards the others  His manners were\\nan immediate recommendation and on conversing with him she found\\nthe solid so fully supporting the superficial that she was at first\\nas she told Anne almost ready to exclaim Can this be Mr Elliot\\nand could not seriously picture to herself a more agreeable\\nor estimable man  Everything united in him good understanding\\ncorrect opinions knowledge of the world and a warm heart\\nHe had strong feelings of family attachment and family honour\\nwithout pride or weakness he lived with the liberality of a man of fortune\\nwithout display he judged for himself in everything essential\\nwithout defying public opinion in any point of worldly decorum\\nHe was steady observant moderate candid never run away with by spirits\\nor by selfishness which fancied itself strong feeling and yet\\nwith a sensibility to what was amiable and lovely and a value\\nfor all the felicities of domestic life which characters of\\nfancied enthusiasm and violent agitation seldom really possess\\nShe was sure that he had not been happy in marriage  Colonel Wallis\\nsaid it and Lady Russell saw it but it had been no unhappiness\\nto sour his mind nor she began pretty soon to suspect to prevent his\\nthinking of a second choice  Her satisfaction in Mr Elliot\\noutweighed all the plague of Mrs Clay\\n\\nIt was now some years since Anne had begun to learn that she\\nand her excellent friend could sometimes think differently\\nand it did not surprise her therefore that Lady Russell\\nshould see nothing suspicious or inconsistent nothing to require\\nmore motives than appeared in Mr Elliots great desire of a reconciliation\\nIn Lady Russells view it was perfectly natural that Mr Elliot\\nat a mature time of life should feel it a most desirable object\\nand what would very generally recommend him among all sensible people\\nto be on good terms with the head of his family the simplest process\\nin the world of time upon a head naturally clear and only erring\\nin the heyday of youth  Anne presumed however still to smile about it\\nand at last to mention Elizabeth  Lady Russell listened and looked\\nand made only this cautious replyElizabeth very well\\ntime will explain\\n\\nIt was a reference to the future which Anne after a little observation\\nfelt she must submit to  She could determine nothing at present\\nIn that house Elizabeth must be first and she was in the habit\\nof such general observance as Miss Elliot that any particularity\\nof attention seemed almost impossible  Mr Elliot too\\nit must be remembered had not been a widower seven months\\nA little delay on his side might be very excusable  In fact\\nAnne could never see the crape round his hat without fearing that\\nshe was the inexcusable one in attributing to him such imaginations\\nfor though his marriage had not been very happy still it had existed\\nso many years that she could not comprehend a very rapid recovery\\nfrom the awful impression of its being dissolved\\n\\nHowever it might end he was without any question their\\npleasantest acquaintance in Bath  she saw nobody equal to him\\nand it was a great indulgence now and then to talk to him about Lyme\\nwhich he seemed to have as lively a wish to see again and to see more of\\nas herself  They went through the particulars of their first meeting\\na great many times  He gave her to understand that he had\\nlooked at her with some earnestness  She knew it well\\nand she remembered another persons look also\\n\\nThey did not always think alike  His value for rank and connexion\\nshe perceived was greater than hers  It was not merely complaisance\\nit must be a liking to the cause which made him enter warmly\\ninto her father and sisters solicitudes on a subject which\\nshe thought unworthy to excite them  The Bath paper one morning\\nannounced the arrival of the Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple\\nand her daughter the Honourable Miss Carteret and all the comfort\\nof No Camden Place was swept away for many days for the Dalrymples\\nin Annes opinion most unfortunately were cousins of the Elliots\\nand the agony was how to introduce themselves properly\\n\\nAnne had never seen her father and sister before in contact with nobility\\nand she must acknowledge herself disappointed  She had hoped\\nbetter things from their high ideas of their own situation in life\\nand was reduced to form a wish which she had never foreseen\\na wish that they had more pride for our cousins Lady Dalrymple\\nand Miss Carteret our cousins the Dalrymples sounded in her ears\\nall day long\\n\\nSir Walter had once been in company with the late viscount\\nbut had never seen any of the rest of the family and the difficulties\\nof the case arose from there having been a suspension of all intercourse\\nby letters of ceremony ever since the death of that said late viscount\\nwhen in consequence of a dangerous illness of Sir Walters\\nat the same time there had been an unlucky omission at Kellynch\\nNo letter of condolence had been sent to Ireland  The neglect\\nhad been visited on the head of the sinner for when poor Lady Elliot\\ndied herself no letter of condolence was received at Kellynch\\nand consequently there was but too much reason to apprehend\\nthat the Dalrymples considered the relationship as closed\\nHow to have this anxious business set to rights and be admitted\\nas cousins again was the question  and it was a question which\\nin a more rational manner neither Lady Russell nor Mr Elliot\\nthought unimportant  Family connexions were always worth preserving\\ngood company always worth seeking Lady Dalrymple had taken a house\\nfor three months in Laura Place and would be living in style\\nShe had been at Bath the year before and Lady Russell had heard her\\nspoken of as a charming woman  It was very desirable that\\nthe connexion should be renewed if it could be done without any\\ncompromise of propriety on the side of the Elliots\\n\\nSir Walter however would choose his own means and at last wrote\\na very fine letter of ample explanation regret and entreaty\\nto his right honourable cousin  Neither Lady Russell nor Mr Elliot\\ncould admire the letter but it did all that was wanted\\nin bringing three lines of scrawl from the Dowager Viscountess\\nShe was very much honoured and should be happy in their acquaintance\\nThe toils of the business were over the sweets began  They visited\\nin Laura Place they had the cards of Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple\\nand the Honourable Miss Carteret to be arranged wherever they might\\nbe most visible  and Our cousins in Laura PlaceOur cousin\\nLady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret were talked of to everybody\\n\\nAnne was ashamed  Had Lady Dalrymple and her daughter even been\\nvery agreeable she would still have been ashamed of the agitation\\nthey created but they were nothing  There was no superiority of manner\\naccomplishment or understanding  Lady Dalrymple had acquired\\nthe name of a charming woman because she had a smile and a civil answer\\nfor everybody  Miss Carteret with still less to say was so plain\\nand so awkward that she would never have been tolerated in Camden Place\\nbut for her birth\\n\\nLady Russell confessed she had expected something better but yet\\nit was an acquaintance worth having and when Anne ventured to speak\\nher opinion of them to Mr Elliot he agreed to their being nothing\\nin themselves but still maintained that as a family connexion\\nas good company as those who would collect good company around them\\nthey had their value  Anne smiled and said\\n\\nMy idea of good company Mr Elliot is the company of clever\\nwellinformed people who have a great deal of conversation\\nthat is what I call good company\\n\\nYou are mistaken said he gently that is not good company\\nthat is the best  Good company requires only birth education\\nand manners and with regard to education is not very nice\\nBirth and good manners are essential but a little learning is\\nby no means a dangerous thing in good company on the contrary\\nit will do very well  My cousin Anne shakes her head\\nShe is not satisfied  She is fastidious  My dear cousin\\nsitting down by her you have a better right to be fastidious\\nthan almost any other woman I know but will it answer\\nWill it make you happy  Will it not be wiser to accept the society\\nof those good ladies in Laura Place and enjoy all the advantages\\nof the connexion as far as possible  You may depend upon it\\nthat they will move in the first set in Bath this winter\\nand as rank is rank your being known to be related to them\\nwill have its use in fixing your family our family let me say\\nin that degree of consideration which we must all wish for\\n\\nYes sighed Anne we shall indeed be known to be related to them\\nthen recollecting herself and not wishing to be answered she added\\nI certainly do think there has been by far too much trouble taken\\nto procure the acquaintance  I suppose smiling I have more pride\\nthan any of you but I confess it does vex me that we should be\\nso solicitous to have the relationship acknowledged which we may\\nbe very sure is a matter of perfect indifference to them\\n\\nPardon me dear cousin you are unjust in your own claims\\nIn London perhaps in your present quiet style of living\\nit might be as you say  but in Bath Sir Walter Elliot and his family\\nwill always be worth knowing  always acceptable as acquaintance\\n\\nWell said Anne I certainly am proud too proud to enjoy a welcome\\nwhich depends so entirely upon place\\n\\nI love your indignation said he it is very natural\\nBut here you are in Bath and the object is to be established here\\nwith all the credit and dignity which ought to belong to Sir Walter Elliot\\nYou talk of being proud I am called proud I know and I shall not wish\\nto believe myself otherwise for our pride if investigated\\nwould have the same object I have no doubt though the kind may seem\\na little different  In one point I am sure my dear cousin\\nhe continued speaking lower though there was no one else in the room\\nin one point I am sure we must feel alike  We must feel that\\nevery addition to your fathers society among his equals or superiors\\nmay be of use in diverting his thoughts from those who are beneath him\\n\\nHe looked as he spoke to the seat which Mrs Clay had been\\nlately occupying  a sufficient explanation of what he particularly meant\\nand though Anne could not believe in their having the same sort of pride\\nshe was pleased with him for not liking Mrs Clay and her conscience\\nadmitted that his wishing to promote her fathers getting\\ngreat acquaintance was more than excusable in the view of defeating her\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 17\\n\\n\\nWhile Sir Walter and Elizabeth were assiduously pushing their\\ngood fortune in Laura Place Anne was renewing an acquaintance\\nof a very different description\\n\\nShe had called on her former governess and had heard from her\\nof there being an old schoolfellow in Bath who had the two strong claims\\non her attention of past kindness and present suffering  Miss Hamilton\\nnow Mrs Smith had shewn her kindness in one of those periods of her life\\nwhen it had been most valuable  Anne had gone unhappy to school\\ngrieving for the loss of a mother whom she had dearly loved\\nfeeling her separation from home and suffering as a girl of fourteen\\nof strong sensibility and not high spirits must suffer at such a time\\nand Miss Hamilton three years older than herself but still from the want\\nof near relations and a settled home remaining another year at school\\nhad been useful and good to her in a way which had considerably lessened\\nher misery and could never be remembered with indifference\\n\\nMiss Hamilton had left school had married not long afterwards\\nwas said to have married a man of fortune and this was all\\nthat Anne had known of her till now that their governesss account\\nbrought her situation forward in a more decided but very different form\\n\\nShe was a widow and poor  Her husband had been extravagant\\nand at his death about two years before had left his affairs\\ndreadfully involved  She had had difficulties of every sort\\nto contend with and in addition to these distresses had been afflicted\\nwith a severe rheumatic fever which finally settling in her legs\\nhad made her for the present a cripple  She had come to Bath\\non that account and was now in lodgings near the hot baths\\nliving in a very humble way unable even to afford herself\\nthe comfort of a servant and of course almost excluded from society\\n\\nTheir mutual friend answered for the satisfaction which a visit\\nfrom Miss Elliot would give Mrs Smith and Anne therefore\\nlost no time in going  She mentioned nothing of what she had heard\\nor what she intended at home  It would excite no proper interest there\\nShe only consulted Lady Russell who entered thoroughly into her sentiments\\nand was most happy to convey her as near to Mrs Smiths lodgings\\nin Westgate Buildings as Anne chose to be taken\\n\\nThe visit was paid their acquaintance reestablished their interest\\nin each other more than rekindled  The first ten minutes\\nhad its awkwardness and its emotion  Twelve years were gone\\nsince they had parted and each presented a somewhat different person\\nfrom what the other had imagined  Twelve years had changed Anne\\nfrom the blooming silent unformed girl of fifteen to the elegant\\nlittle woman of sevenandtwenty with every beauty except bloom\\nand with manners as consciously right as they were invariably gentle\\nand twelve years had transformed the finelooking wellgrown Miss Hamilton\\nin all the glow of health and confidence of superiority into a poor\\ninfirm helpless widow receiving the visit of her former protegee\\nas a favour but all that was uncomfortable in the meeting had soon\\npassed away and left only the interesting charm of remembering\\nformer partialities and talking over old times\\n\\nAnne found in Mrs Smith the good sense and agreeable manners which\\nshe had almost ventured to depend on and a disposition to converse\\nand be cheerful beyond her expectation  Neither the dissipations\\nof the pastand she had lived very much in the worldnor the restrictions\\nof the present neither sickness nor sorrow seemed to have\\nclosed her heart or ruined her spirits\\n\\nIn the course of a second visit she talked with great openness\\nand Annes astonishment increased  She could scarcely imagine\\na more cheerless situation in itself than Mrs Smiths  She had been\\nvery fond of her husband  she had buried him  She had been\\nused to affluence  it was gone  She had no child to connect her\\nwith life and happiness again no relations to assist in the arrangement\\nof perplexed affairs no health to make all the rest supportable\\nHer accommodations were limited to a noisy parlour and a dark bedroom\\nbehind with no possibility of moving from one to the other without\\nassistance which there was only one servant in the house to afford\\nand she never quitted the house but to be conveyed into the warm bath\\nYet in spite of all this Anne had reason to believe that she had\\nmoments only of languor and depression to hours of occupation\\nand enjoyment  How could it be  She watched observed reflected\\nand finally determined that this was not a case of fortitude\\nor of resignation only  A submissive spirit might be patient\\na strong understanding would supply resolution but here was something more\\nhere was that elasticity of mind that disposition to be comforted\\nthat power of turning readily from evil to good and of finding employment\\nwhich carried her out of herself which was from nature alone\\nIt was the choicest gift of Heaven and Anne viewed her friend\\nas one of those instances in which by a merciful appointment\\nit seems designed to counterbalance almost every other want\\n\\nThere had been a time Mrs Smith told her when her spirits\\nhad nearly failed  She could not call herself an invalid now\\ncompared with her state on first reaching Bath  Then she had indeed\\nbeen a pitiable object for she had caught cold on the journey\\nand had hardly taken possession of her lodgings before she was again\\nconfined to her bed and suffering under severe and constant pain\\nand all this among strangers with the absolute necessity of having\\na regular nurse and finances at that moment particularly unfit\\nto meet any extraordinary expense  She had weathered it however\\nand could truly say that it had done her good  It had increased\\nher comforts by making her feel herself to be in good hands\\nShe had seen too much of the world to expect sudden or disinterested\\nattachment anywhere but her illness had proved to her that her landlady\\nhad a character to preserve and would not use her ill and she had been\\nparticularly fortunate in her nurse as a sister of her landlady\\na nurse by profession and who had always a home in that house\\nwhen unemployed chanced to be at liberty just in time to attend her\\nAnd she said Mrs Smith besides nursing me most admirably\\nhas really proved an invaluable acquaintance  As soon as I could\\nuse my hands she taught me to knit which has been a great amusement\\nand she put me in the way of making these little threadcases\\npincushions and cardracks which you always find me so busy about\\nand which supply me with the means of doing a little good\\nto one or two very poor families in this neighbourhood\\nShe had a large acquaintance of course professionally among those\\nwho can afford to buy and she disposes of my merchandise\\nShe always takes the right time for applying  Everybodys heart is open\\nyou know when they have recently escaped from severe pain\\nor are recovering the blessing of health and Nurse Rooke\\nthoroughly understands when to speak  She is a shrewd intelligent\\nsensible woman  Hers is a line for seeing human nature and she has\\na fund of good sense and observation which as a companion make her\\ninfinitely superior to thousands of those who having only received\\nthe best education in the world know nothing worth attending to\\nCall it gossip if you will but when Nurse Rooke has half an hours\\nleisure to bestow on me she is sure to have something to relate\\nthat is entertaining and profitable  something that makes one\\nknow ones species better  One likes to hear what is going on\\nto be au fait as to the newest modes of being trifling and silly\\nTo me who live so much alone her conversation I assure you is a treat\\n\\nAnne far from wishing to cavil at the pleasure replied\\nI can easily believe it  Women of that class have great opportunities\\nand if they are intelligent may be well worth listening to\\nSuch varieties of human nature as they are in the habit of witnessing\\nAnd it is not merely in its follies that they are well read\\nfor they see it occasionally under every circumstance that can be\\nmost interesting or affecting  What instances must pass before them\\nof ardent disinterested selfdenying attachment of heroism fortitude\\npatience resignation  of all the conflicts and all the sacrifices\\nthat ennoble us most  A sick chamber may often furnish\\nthe worth of volumes\\n\\nYes said Mrs Smith more doubtingly sometimes it may\\nthough I fear its lessons are not often in the elevated style you describe\\nHere and there human nature may be great in times of trial\\nbut generally speaking it is its weakness and not its strength\\nthat appears in a sick chamber  it is selfishness and impatience\\nrather than generosity and fortitude that one hears of\\nThere is so little real friendship in the world and unfortunately\\nspeaking low and tremulously there are so many who forget\\nto think seriously till it is almost too late\\n\\nAnne saw the misery of such feelings  The husband had not been\\nwhat he ought and the wife had been led among that part of mankind\\nwhich made her think worse of the world than she hoped it deserved\\nIt was but a passing emotion however with Mrs Smith she shook it off\\nand soon added in a different tone\\n\\nI do not suppose the situation my friend Mrs Rooke is in at present\\nwill furnish much either to interest or edify me  She is only nursing\\nMrs Wallis of Marlborough Buildings a mere pretty silly expensive\\nfashionable woman I believe and of course will have nothing to report\\nbut of lace and finery  I mean to make my profit of Mrs Wallis however\\nShe has plenty of money and I intend she shall buy all\\nthe highpriced things I have in hand now\\n\\nAnne had called several times on her friend before the existence\\nof such a person was known in Camden Place  At last it became necessary\\nto speak of her Sir Walter Elizabeth and Mrs Clay returned one morning\\nfrom Laura Place with a sudden invitation from Lady Dalrymple\\nfor the same evening and Anne was already engaged to spend that evening\\nin Westgate Buildings  She was not sorry for the excuse\\nThey were only asked she was sure because Lady Dalrymple being\\nkept at home by a bad cold was glad to make use of the relationship\\nwhich had been so pressed on her and she declined on her own account\\nwith great alacrityShe was engaged to spend the evening\\nwith an old schoolfellow  They were not much interested in anything\\nrelative to Anne but still there were questions enough asked\\nto make it understood what this old schoolfellow was and Elizabeth\\nwas disdainful and Sir Walter severe\\n\\nWestgate Buildings said he and who is Miss Anne Elliot\\nto be visiting in Westgate Buildings  A Mrs Smith  A widow Mrs Smith\\nand who was her husband  One of five thousand Mr Smiths whose names\\nare to be met with everywhere  And what is her attraction\\nThat she is old and sickly  Upon my word Miss Anne Elliot\\nyou have the most extraordinary taste  Everything that revolts\\nother people low company paltry rooms foul air disgusting associations\\nare inviting to you  But surely you may put off this old lady\\ntill tomorrow  she is not so near her end I presume\\nbut that she may hope to see another day  What is her age  Forty\\n\\nNo sir she is not oneandthirty but I do not think I can\\nput off my engagement because it is the only evening for some time\\nwhich will at once suit her and myself  She goes into the warm bath\\ntomorrow and for the rest of the week you know we are engaged\\n\\nBut what does Lady Russell think of this acquaintance asked Elizabeth\\n\\nShe sees nothing to blame in it replied Anne on the contrary\\nshe approves it and has generally taken me when I have\\ncalled on Mrs Smith\\n\\nWestgate Buildings must have been rather surprised by the appearance\\nof a carriage drawn up near its pavement observed Sir Walter\\nSir Henry Russells widow indeed has no honours to distinguish her arms\\nbut still it is a handsome equipage and no doubt is well known\\nto convey a Miss Elliot  A widow Mrs Smith lodging in Westgate Buildings\\nA poor widow barely able to live between thirty and forty\\na mere Mrs Smith an everyday Mrs Smith of all people and all names\\nin the world to be the chosen friend of Miss Anne Elliot\\nand to be preferred by her to her own family connections among the nobility\\nof England and Ireland  Mrs Smith  Such a name\\n\\nMrs Clay who had been present while all this passed now thought it\\nadvisable to leave the room and Anne could have said much\\nand did long to say a little in defence of her friends\\nnot very dissimilar claims to theirs but her sense of personal respect\\nto her father prevented her  She made no reply  She left it\\nto himself to recollect that Mrs Smith was not the only widow\\nin Bath between thirty and forty with little to live on\\nand no surname of dignity\\n\\nAnne kept her appointment the others kept theirs and of course\\nshe heard the next morning that they had had a delightful evening\\nShe had been the only one of the set absent for Sir Walter\\nand Elizabeth had not only been quite at her ladyships service themselves\\nbut had actually been happy to be employed by her in collecting others\\nand had been at the trouble of inviting both Lady Russell and Mr Elliot\\nand Mr Elliot had made a point of leaving Colonel Wallis early\\nand Lady Russell had fresh arranged all her evening engagements\\nin order to wait on her  Anne had the whole history of all that\\nsuch an evening could supply from Lady Russell  To her\\nits greatest interest must be in having been very much talked of\\nbetween her friend and Mr Elliot in having been wished for regretted\\nand at the same time honoured for staying away in such a cause\\nHer kind compassionate visits to this old schoolfellow\\nsick and reduced seemed to have quite delighted Mr Elliot\\nHe thought her a most extraordinary young woman in her temper manners\\nmind a model of female excellence  He could meet even Lady Russell\\nin a discussion of her merits and Anne could not be given to understand\\nso much by her friend could not know herself to be so highly rated\\nby a sensible man without many of those agreeable sensations\\nwhich her friend meant to create\\n\\nLady Russell was now perfectly decided in her opinion of Mr Elliot\\nShe was as much convinced of his meaning to gain Anne in time as of\\nhis deserving her and was beginning to calculate the number of weeks\\nwhich would free him from all the remaining restraints of widowhood\\nand leave him at liberty to exert his most open powers of pleasing\\nShe would not speak to Anne with half the certainty she felt on the subject\\nshe would venture on little more than hints of what might be hereafter\\nof a possible attachment on his side of the desirableness of the alliance\\nsupposing such attachment to be real and returned  Anne heard her\\nand made no violent exclamations she only smiled blushed\\nand gently shook her head\\n\\nI am no matchmaker as you well know said Lady Russell\\nbeing much too well aware of the uncertainty of all human events\\nand calculations  I only mean that if Mr Elliot should some time hence\\npay his addresses to you and if you should be disposed to accept him\\nI think there would be every possibility of your being happy together\\nA most suitable connection everybody must consider it but I think\\nit might be a very happy one\\n\\nMr Elliot is an exceedingly agreeable man and in many respects\\nI think highly of him said Anne but we should not suit\\n\\nLady Russell let this pass and only said in rejoinder I own that\\nto be able to regard you as the future mistress of Kellynch\\nthe future Lady Elliot to look forward and see you occupying\\nyour dear mothers place succeeding to all her rights\\nand all her popularity as well as to all her virtues would be\\nthe highest possible gratification to me  You are your mothers self\\nin countenance and disposition and if I might be allowed to fancy you\\nsuch as she was in situation and name and home presiding and blessing\\nin the same spot and only superior to her in being more highly valued\\nMy dearest Anne it would give me more delight than is often felt\\nat my time of life\\n\\nAnne was obliged to turn away to rise to walk to a distant table\\nand leaning there in pretended employment try to subdue the feelings\\nthis picture excited  For a few moments her imagination and her heart\\nwere bewitched  The idea of becoming what her mother had been\\nof having the precious name of Lady Elliot first revived in herself\\nof being restored to Kellynch calling it her home again\\nher home for ever was a charm which she could not immediately resist\\nLady Russell said not another word willing to leave the matter\\nto its own operation and believing that could Mr Elliot at that moment\\nwith propriety have spoken for himselfshe believed in short\\nwhat Anne did not believe  The same image of Mr Elliot speaking\\nfor himself brought Anne to composure again  The charm of Kellynch\\nand of Lady Elliot all faded away  She never could accept him\\nAnd it was not only that her feelings were still adverse to any man\\nsave one her judgement on a serious consideration of the possibilities\\nof such a case was against Mr Elliot\\n\\nThough they had now been acquainted a month she could not be satisfied\\nthat she really knew his character  That he was a sensible man\\nan agreeable man that he talked well professed good opinions\\nseemed to judge properly and as a man of principle this was all\\nclear enough  He certainly knew what was right nor could she fix\\non any one article of moral duty evidently transgressed but yet she would\\nhave been afraid to answer for his conduct  She distrusted the past\\nif not the present  The names which occasionally dropt\\nof former associates the allusions to former practices and pursuits\\nsuggested suspicions not favourable of what he had been\\nShe saw that there had been bad habits that Sunday travelling\\nhad been a common thing that there had been a period of his life\\nand probably not a short one when he had been at least\\ncareless in all serious matters and though he might now think\\nvery differently who could answer for the true sentiments of a clever\\ncautious man grown old enough to appreciate a fair character\\nHow could it ever be ascertained that his mind was truly cleansed\\n\\nMr Elliot was rational discreet polished but he was not open\\nThere was never any burst of feeling any warmth of indignation or delight\\nat the evil or good of others  This to Anne was a decided imperfection\\nHer early impressions were incurable  She prized the frank\\nthe openhearted the eager character beyond all others\\nWarmth and enthusiasm did captivate her still  She felt that she could\\nso much more depend upon the sincerity of those who sometimes looked\\nor said a careless or a hasty thing than of those whose presence of mind\\nnever varied whose tongue never slipped\\n\\nMr Elliot was too generally agreeable  Various as were the tempers\\nin her fathers house he pleased them all  He endured too well\\nstood too well with every body  He had spoken to her with some\\ndegree of openness of Mrs Clay had appeared completely to see\\nwhat Mrs Clay was about and to hold her in contempt and yet\\nMrs Clay found him as agreeable as any body\\n\\nLady Russell saw either less or more than her young friend\\nfor she saw nothing to excite distrust  She could not imagine\\na man more exactly what he ought to be than Mr Elliot nor did she\\never enjoy a sweeter feeling than the hope of seeing him receive\\nthe hand of her beloved Anne in Kellynch church in the course of\\nthe following autumn\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 18\\n\\n\\nIt was the beginning of February and Anne having been a month in Bath\\nwas growing very eager for news from Uppercross and Lyme\\nShe wanted to hear much more than Mary had communicated\\nIt was three weeks since she had heard at all  She only knew\\nthat Henrietta was at home again and that Louisa though considered to be\\nrecovering fast was still in Lyme and she was thinking of them all\\nvery intently one evening when a thicker letter than usual from Mary\\nwas delivered to her and to quicken the pleasure and surprise\\nwith Admiral and Mrs Crofts compliments\\n\\nThe Crofts must be in Bath  A circumstance to interest her\\nThey were people whom her heart turned to very naturally\\n\\nWhat is this cried Sir Walter  The Crofts have arrived in Bath\\nThe Crofts who rent Kellynch  What have they brought you\\n\\nA letter from Uppercross Cottage Sir\\n\\nOh those letters are convenient passports  They secure an introduction\\nI should have visited Admiral Croft however at any rate\\nI know what is due to my tenant\\n\\nAnne could listen no longer she could not even have told how\\nthe poor Admirals complexion escaped her letter engrossed her\\nIt had been begun several days back\\n\\n\\n            February 1st\\n\\nMy dear AnneI make no apology for my silence because I know\\nhow little people think of letters in such a place as Bath\\nYou must be a great deal too happy to care for Uppercross which\\nas you well know affords little to write about  We have had\\na very dull Christmas Mr and Mrs Musgrove have not had one dinner party\\nall the holidays  I do not reckon the Hayters as anybody\\nThe holidays however are over at last  I believe no children ever had\\nsuch long ones  I am sure I had not  The house was cleared yesterday\\nexcept of the little Harvilles but you will be surprised to hear\\nthey have never gone home  Mrs Harville must be an odd mother\\nto part with them so long  I do not understand it  They are\\nnot at all nice children in my opinion but Mrs Musgrove seems to\\nlike them quite as well if not better than her grandchildren\\nWhat dreadful weather we have had  It may not be felt in Bath\\nwith your nice pavements but in the country it is of some consequence\\nI have not had a creature call on me since the second week in January\\nexcept Charles Hayter who had been calling much oftener than was welcome\\nBetween ourselves I think it a great pity Henrietta did not remain at Lyme\\nas long as Louisa it would have kept her a little out of his way\\nThe carriage is gone today to bring Louisa and the Harvilles tomorrow\\nWe are not asked to dine with them however till the day after\\nMrs Musgrove is so afraid of her being fatigued by the journey\\nwhich is not very likely considering the care that will be taken of her\\nand it would be much more convenient to me to dine there tomorrow\\nI am glad you find Mr Elliot so agreeable and wish I could be acquainted\\nwith him too but I have my usual luck  I am always out of the way\\nwhen any thing desirable is going on always the last of my family\\nto be noticed  What an immense time Mrs Clay has been staying\\nwith Elizabeth  Does she never mean to go away  But perhaps\\nif she were to leave the room vacant we might not be invited\\nLet me know what you think of this  I do not expect my children\\nto be asked you know  I can leave them at the Great House very well\\nfor a month or six weeks  I have this moment heard that the Crofts\\nare going to Bath almost immediately they think the Admiral gouty\\nCharles heard it quite by chance they have not had the civility\\nto give me any notice or of offering to take anything\\nI do not think they improve at all as neighbours  We see nothing of them\\nand this is really an instance of gross inattention  Charles joins me\\nin love and everything proper  Yours affectionately\\n\\n  Mary M\\n\\nI am sorry to say that I am very far from well and Jemima has\\njust told me that the butcher says there is a bad sorethroat\\nvery much about  I dare say I shall catch it and my sorethroats\\nyou know are always worse than anybodys\\n\\n\\nSo ended the first part which had been afterwards put into an envelope\\ncontaining nearly as much more\\n\\n\\nI kept my letter open that I might send you word how Louisa\\nbore her journey and now I am extremely glad I did having a great deal\\nto add  In the first place I had a note from Mrs Croft yesterday\\noffering to convey anything to you a very kind friendly note indeed\\naddressed to me just as it ought I shall therefore be able to\\nmake my letter as long as I like  The Admiral does not seem very ill\\nand I sincerely hope Bath will do him all the good he wants\\nI shall be truly glad to have them back again  Our neighbourhood\\ncannot spare such a pleasant family  But now for Louisa\\nI have something to communicate that will astonish you not a little\\nShe and the Harvilles came on Tuesday very safely and in the evening\\nwe went to ask her how she did when we were rather surprised\\nnot to find Captain Benwick of the party for he had been invited\\nas well as the Harvilles and what do you think was the reason\\nNeither more nor less than his being in love with Louisa\\nand not choosing to venture to Uppercross till he had had an answer\\nfrom Mr Musgrove for it was all settled between him and her\\nbefore she came away and he had written to her father by Captain Harville\\nTrue upon my honour  Are not you astonished  I shall be surprised\\nat least if you ever received a hint of it for I never did\\nMrs Musgrove protests solemnly that she knew nothing of the matter\\nWe are all very well pleased however for though it is not equal to her\\nmarrying Captain Wentworth it is infinitely better than Charles Hayter\\nand Mr Musgrove has written his consent and Captain Benwick\\nis expected today  Mrs Harville says her husband feels a good deal\\non his poor sisters account but however Louisa is a great favourite\\nwith both  Indeed Mrs Harville and I quite agree that we love her\\nthe better for having nursed her  Charles wonders what Captain Wentworth\\nwill say but if you remember I never thought him attached to Louisa\\nI never could see anything of it  And this is the end you see\\nof Captain Benwicks being supposed to be an admirer of yours\\nHow Charles could take such a thing into his head was always\\nincomprehensible to me  I hope he will be more agreeable now\\nCertainly not a great match for Louisa Musgrove but a million times better\\nthan marrying among the Hayters\\n\\n\\nMary need not have feared her sisters being in any degree prepared\\nfor the news  She had never in her life been more astonished\\nCaptain Benwick and Louisa Musgrove  It was almost too wonderful\\nfor belief and it was with the greatest effort that she could remain\\nin the room preserve an air of calmness and answer the common questions\\nof the moment  Happily for her they were not many  Sir Walter\\nwanted to know whether the Crofts travelled with four horses\\nand whether they were likely to be situated in such a part of Bath\\nas it might suit Miss Elliot and himself to visit in but had\\nlittle curiosity beyond\\n\\nHow is Mary said Elizabeth and without waiting for an answer\\nAnd pray what brings the Crofts to Bath\\n\\nThey come on the Admirals account  He is thought to be gouty\\n\\nGout and decrepitude said Sir Walter  Poor old gentleman\\n\\nHave they any acquaintance here asked Elizabeth\\n\\nI do not know but I can hardly suppose that at Admiral Crofts\\ntime of life and in his profession he should not have many acquaintance\\nin such a place as this\\n\\nI suspect said Sir Walter coolly that Admiral Croft\\nwill be best known in Bath as the renter of Kellynch Hall\\nElizabeth may we venture to present him and his wife in Laura Place\\n\\nOh no I think not  Situated as we are with Lady Dalrymple cousins\\nwe ought to be very careful not to embarrass her with acquaintance\\nshe might not approve  If we were not related it would not signify\\nbut as cousins she would feel scrupulous as to any proposal of ours\\nWe had better leave the Crofts to find their own level\\nThere are several oddlooking men walking about here who\\nI am told are sailors  The Crofts will associate with them\\n\\nThis was Sir Walter and Elizabeths share of interest in the letter\\nwhen Mrs Clay had paid her tribute of more decent attention\\nin an enquiry after Mrs Charles Musgrove and her fine little boys\\nAnne was at liberty\\n\\nIn her own room she tried to comprehend it  Well might Charles wonder\\nhow Captain Wentworth would feel  Perhaps he had quitted the field\\nhad given Louisa up had ceased to love had found he did not love her\\nShe could not endure the idea of treachery or levity or anything\\nakin to ill usage between him and his friend  She could not endure\\nthat such a friendship as theirs should be severed unfairly\\n\\nCaptain Benwick and Louisa Musgrove  The highspirited\\njoyoustalking Louisa Musgrove and the dejected thinking\\nfeeling reading Captain Benwick seemed each of them everything\\nthat would not suit the other  Their minds most dissimilar\\nWhere could have been the attraction  The answer soon presented itself\\nIt had been in situation  They had been thrown together several weeks\\nthey had been living in the same small family party  since Henriettas\\ncoming away they must have been depending almost entirely on each other\\nand Louisa just recovering from illness had been in an interesting state\\nand Captain Benwick was not inconsolable  That was a point which Anne\\nhad not been able to avoid suspecting before and instead of drawing\\nthe same conclusion as Mary from the present course of events\\nthey served only to confirm the idea of his having felt some\\ndawning of tenderness toward herself  She did not mean however\\nto derive much more from it to gratify her vanity than Mary\\nmight have allowed  She was persuaded that any tolerably pleasing\\nyoung woman who had listened and seemed to feel for him would have\\nreceived the same compliment  He had an affectionate heart\\nHe must love somebody\\n\\nShe saw no reason against their being happy  Louisa had fine\\nnaval fervour to begin with and they would soon grow more alike\\nHe would gain cheerfulness and she would learn to be an enthusiast\\nfor Scott and Lord Byron nay that was probably learnt already\\nof course they had fallen in love over poetry  The idea of\\nLouisa Musgrove turned into a person of literary taste\\nand sentimental reflection was amusing but she had no doubt\\nof its being so  The day at Lyme the fall from the Cobb\\nmight influence her health her nerves her courage her character to\\nthe end of her life as thoroughly as it appeared to have\\ninfluenced her fate\\n\\nThe conclusion of the whole was that if the woman who had been sensible\\nof Captain Wentworths merits could be allowed to prefer another man\\nthere was nothing in the engagement to excite lasting wonder\\nand if Captain Wentworth lost no friend by it certainly nothing\\nto be regretted  No it was not regret which made Annes heart\\nbeat in spite of herself and brought the colour into her cheeks\\nwhen she thought of Captain Wentworth unshackled and free\\nShe had some feelings which she was ashamed to investigate\\nThey were too much like joy senseless joy\\n\\nShe longed to see the Crofts but when the meeting took place\\nit was evident that no rumour of the news had yet reached them\\nThe visit of ceremony was paid and returned and Louisa Musgrove\\nwas mentioned and Captain Benwick too without even half a smile\\n\\nThe Crofts had placed themselves in lodgings in Gay Street\\nperfectly to Sir Walters satisfaction  He was not at all ashamed\\nof the acquaintance and did in fact think and talk a great deal more\\nabout the Admiral than the Admiral ever thought or talked about him\\n\\nThe Crofts knew quite as many people in Bath as they wished for\\nand considered their intercourse with the Elliots as a mere matter of form\\nand not in the least likely to afford them any pleasure\\nThey brought with them their country habit of being almost always together\\nHe was ordered to walk to keep off the gout and Mrs Croft\\nseemed to go shares with him in everything and to walk\\nfor her life to do him good  Anne saw them wherever she went\\nLady Russell took her out in her carriage almost every morning\\nand she never failed to think of them and never failed to see them\\nKnowing their feelings as she did it was a most attractive picture\\nof happiness to her  She always watched them as long as she could\\ndelighted to fancy she understood what they might be talking of\\nas they walked along in happy independence or equally delighted\\nto see the Admirals hearty shake of the hand when he encountered\\nan old friend and observe their eagerness of conversation\\nwhen occasionally forming into a little knot of the navy Mrs Croft\\nlooking as intelligent and keen as any of the officers around her\\n\\nAnne was too much engaged with Lady Russell to be often walking herself\\nbut it so happened that one morning about a week or ten days\\nafter the Crofts arrival it suited her best to leave her friend\\nor her friends carriage in the lower part of the town\\nand return alone to Camden Place and in walking up Milsom Street\\nshe had the good fortune to meet with the Admiral  He was standing\\nby himself at a printshop window with his hands behind him\\nin earnest contemplation of some print and she not only might have\\npassed him unseen but was obliged to touch as well as address him\\nbefore she could catch his notice  When he did perceive and\\nacknowledge her however it was done with all his usual frankness\\nand good humour  Ha is it you  Thank you thank you\\nThis is treating me like a friend  Here I am you see\\nstaring at a picture  I can never get by this shop without stopping\\nBut what a thing here is by way of a boat  Do look at it\\nDid you ever see the like  What queer fellows your fine painters must be\\nto think that anybody would venture their lives in such a shapeless\\nold cockleshell as that  And yet here are two gentlemen\\nstuck up in it mightily at their ease and looking about them at the rocks\\nand mountains as if they were not to be upset the next moment\\nwhich they certainly must be  I wonder where that boat was built\\nlaughing heartily I would not venture over a horsepond in it\\nWell turning away now where are you bound  Can I go anywhere\\nfor you or with you  Can I be of any use\\n\\nNone I thank you unless you will give me the pleasure of your company\\nthe little way our road lies together  I am going home\\n\\n\\nThat I will with all my heart and farther too  Yes yes\\nwe will have a snug walk together and I have something to tell you\\nas we go along  There take my arm thats right I do not\\nfeel comfortable if I have not a woman there  Lord what a boat it is\\ntaking a last look at the picture as they began to be in motion\\n\\nDid you say that you had something to tell me sir\\n\\nYes I have presently  But here comes a friend Captain Brigden\\nI shall only say How dye do as we pass however  I shall not stop\\nHow dye do  Brigden stares to see anybody with me but my wife\\nShe poor soul is tied by the leg  She has a blister on one of her heels\\nas large as a threeshilling piece  If you look across the street\\nyou will see Admiral Brand coming down and his brother  Shabby fellows\\nboth of them  I am glad they are not on this side of the way\\nSophy cannot bear them  They played me a pitiful trick once\\ngot away with some of my best men  I will tell you the whole story\\nanother time  There comes old Sir Archibald Drew and his grandson\\nLook he sees us he kisses his hand to you he takes you for my wife\\nAh the peace has come too soon for that younker  Poor old Sir Archibald\\nHow do you like Bath Miss Elliot  It suits us very well\\nWe are always meeting with some old friend or other the streets\\nfull of them every morning sure to have plenty of chat\\nand then we get away from them all and shut ourselves in our lodgings\\nand draw in our chairs and are snug as if we were at Kellynch\\nay or as we used to be even at North Yarmouth and Deal\\nWe do not like our lodgings here the worse I can tell you\\nfor putting us in mind of those we first had at North Yarmouth\\nThe wind blows through one of the cupboards just in the same way\\n\\nWhen they were got a little farther Anne ventured to press again\\nfor what he had to communicate  She hoped when clear of Milsom Street\\nto have her curiosity gratified but she was still obliged to wait\\nfor the Admiral had made up his mind not to begin till they had\\ngained the greater space and quiet of Belmont and as she was\\nnot really Mrs Croft she must let him have his own way\\nAs soon as they were fairly ascending Belmont he began\\n\\nWell now you shall hear something that will surprise you\\nBut first of all you must tell me the name of the young lady\\nI am going to talk about  That young lady you know that we have\\nall been so concerned for  The Miss Musgrove that all this has been\\nhappening to  Her Christian name  I always forget her Christian name\\n\\nAnne had been ashamed to appear to comprehend so soon as she really\\ndid but now she could safely suggest the name of Louisa\\n\\nAy ay Miss Louisa Musgrove that is the name  I wish young ladies\\nhad not such a number of fine Christian names  I should never be out\\nif they were all Sophys or something of that sort  Well\\nthis Miss Louisa we all thought you know was to marry Frederick\\nHe was courting her week after week  The only wonder was\\nwhat they could be waiting for till the business at Lyme came\\nthen indeed it was clear enough that they must wait till her brain\\nwas set to right  But even then there was something odd in their\\nway of going on  Instead of staying at Lyme he went off to Plymouth\\nand then he went off to see Edward  When we came back from Minehead\\nhe was gone down to Edwards and there he has been ever since\\nWe have seen nothing of him since November  Even Sophy could\\nnot understand it  But now the matter has take the strangest turn of all\\nfor this young lady the same Miss Musgrove instead of being\\nto marry Frederick is to marry James Benwick  You know James Benwick\\n\\nA little  I am a little acquainted with Captain Benwick\\n\\nWell she is to marry him  Nay most likely they are married already\\nfor I do not know what they should wait for\\n\\nI thought Captain Benwick a very pleasing young man said Anne\\nand I understand that he bears an excellent character\\n\\nOh yes yes there is not a word to be said against James Benwick\\nHe is only a commander it is true made last summer and these are\\nbad times for getting on but he has not another fault that I know of\\nAn excellent goodhearted fellow I assure you a very active\\nzealous officer too which is more than you would think for perhaps\\nfor that soft sort of manner does not do him justice\\n\\nIndeed you are mistaken there sir I should never augur want of spirit\\nfrom Captain Benwicks manners  I thought them particularly pleasing\\nand I will answer for it they would generally please\\n\\nWell well ladies are the best judges but James Benwick is rather too\\npiano for me and though very likely it is all our partiality\\nSophy and I cannot help thinking Fredericks manners better than his\\nThere is something about Frederick more to our taste\\n\\nAnne was caught  She had only meant to oppose the too common idea\\nof spirit and gentleness being incompatible with each other\\nnot at all to represent Captain Benwicks manners as the very best\\nthat could possibly be and after a little hesitation\\nshe was beginning to say I was not entering into any comparison\\nof the two friends but the Admiral interrupted her with\\n\\nAnd the thing is certainly true  It is not a mere bit of gossip\\nWe have it from Frederick himself  His sister had a letter\\nfrom him yesterday in which he tells us of it and he had just had it\\nin a letter from Harville written upon the spot from Uppercross\\nI fancy they are all at Uppercross\\n\\nThis was an opportunity which Anne could not resist she said therefore\\nI hope Admiral I hope there is nothing in the style of Captain\\nWentworths letter to make you and Mrs Croft particularly uneasy\\nIt did seem last autumn as if there were an attachment between him\\nand Louisa Musgrove but I hope it may be understood to have worn out\\non each side equally and without violence  I hope his letter\\ndoes not breathe the spirit of an illused man\\n\\nNot at all not at all there is not an oath or a murmur\\nfrom beginning to end\\n\\nAnne looked down to hide her smile\\n\\nNo no Frederick is not a man to whine and complain he has\\ntoo much spirit for that  If the girl likes another man better\\nit is very fit she should have him\\n\\nCertainly  But what I mean is that I hope there is nothing\\nin Captain Wentworths manner of writing to make you suppose\\nhe thinks himself illused by his friend which might appear\\nyou know without its being absolutely said  I should be very sorry\\nthat such a friendship as has subsisted between him and Captain Benwick\\nshould be destroyed or even wounded by a circumstance of this sort\\n\\nYes yes I understand you  But there is nothing at all of that nature\\nin the letter  He does not give the least fling at Benwick\\ndoes not so much as say I wonder at it I have a reason of my own\\nfor wondering at it  No you would not guess from his way of writing\\nthat he had ever thought of this Miss whats her name for himself\\nHe very handsomely hopes they will be happy together and there is\\nnothing very unforgiving in that I think\\n\\nAnne did not receive the perfect conviction which the Admiral meant\\nto convey but it would have been useless to press the enquiry farther\\nShe therefore satisfied herself with commonplace remarks or quiet\\nattention and the Admiral had it all his own way\\n\\nPoor Frederick said he at last  Now he must begin all over again\\nwith somebody else  I think we must get him to Bath  Sophy must write\\nand beg him to come to Bath  Here are pretty girls enough I am sure\\nIt would be of no use to go to Uppercross again for that other\\nMiss Musgrove I find is bespoke by her cousin the young parson\\nDo not you think Miss Elliot we had better try to get him to Bath\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 19\\n\\n\\nWhile Admiral Croft was taking this walk with Anne and expressing\\nhis wish of getting Captain Wentworth to Bath Captain Wentworth\\nwas already on his way thither  Before Mrs Croft had written\\nhe was arrived and the very next time Anne walked out she saw him\\n\\nMr Elliot was attending his two cousins and Mrs Clay  They were\\nin Milsom Street  It began to rain not much but enough to\\nmake shelter desirable for women and quite enough to make it\\nvery desirable for Miss Elliot to have the advantage of being\\nconveyed home in Lady Dalrymples carriage which was seen waiting\\nat a little distance she Anne and Mrs Clay therefore\\nturned into Mollands while Mr Elliot stepped to Lady Dalrymple\\nto request her assistance  He soon joined them again successful\\nof course Lady Dalrymple would be most happy to take them home\\nand would call for them in a few minutes\\n\\nHer ladyships carriage was a barouche and did not hold\\nmore than four with any comfort  Miss Carteret was with her mother\\nconsequently it was not reasonable to expect accommodation\\nfor all the three Camden Place ladies  There could be no doubt\\nas to Miss Elliot  Whoever suffered inconvenience she must suffer none\\nbut it occupied a little time to settle the point of civility\\nbetween the other two  The rain was a mere trifle and Anne was\\nmost sincere in preferring a walk with Mr Elliot  But the rain was also\\na mere trifle to Mrs Clay she would hardly allow it even to drop at all\\nand her boots were so thick much thicker than Miss Annes\\nand in short her civility rendered her quite as anxious to be left\\nto walk with Mr Elliot as Anne could be and it was discussed between them\\nwith a generosity so polite and so determined that the others were\\nobliged to settle it for them Miss Elliot maintaining that Mrs Clay\\nhad a little cold already and Mr Elliot deciding on appeal\\nthat his cousin Annes boots were rather the thickest\\n\\nIt was fixed accordingly that Mrs Clay should be of the party\\nin the carriage and they had just reached this point when Anne\\nas she sat near the window descried most decidedly and distinctly\\nCaptain Wentworth walking down the street\\n\\nHer start was perceptible only to herself but she instantly felt that\\nshe was the greatest simpleton in the world the most unaccountable\\nand absurd  For a few minutes she saw nothing before her\\nit was all confusion  She was lost and when she had scolded\\nback her senses she found the others still waiting for the carriage\\nand Mr Elliot always obliging just setting off for Union Street\\non a commission of Mrs Clays\\n\\nShe now felt a great inclination to go to the outer door\\nshe wanted to see if it rained  Why was she to suspect herself\\nof another motive  Captain Wentworth must be out of sight\\nShe left her seat she would go one half of her should not be always\\nso much wiser than the other half or always suspecting the other\\nof being worse than it was  She would see if it rained\\nShe was sent back however in a moment by the entrance of\\nCaptain Wentworth himself among a party of gentlemen and ladies\\nevidently his acquaintance and whom he must have joined\\na little below Milsom Street  He was more obviously struck\\nand confused by the sight of her than she had ever observed before\\nhe looked quite red  For the first time since their renewed acquaintance\\nshe felt that she was betraying the least sensibility of the two\\nShe had the advantage of him in the preparation of the last few moments\\nAll the overpowering blinding bewildering first effects\\nof strong surprise were over with her  Still however\\nshe had enough to feel  It was agitation pain pleasure\\na something between delight and misery\\n\\nHe spoke to her and then turned away  The character of his manner\\nwas embarrassment  She could not have called it either cold or friendly\\nor anything so certainly as embarrassed\\n\\nAfter a short interval however he came towards her and spoke again\\nMutual enquiries on common subjects passed  neither of them probably\\nmuch the wiser for what they heard and Anne continuing fully sensible\\nof his being less at ease than formerly  They had by dint of being\\nso very much together got to speak to each other with a considerable\\nportion of apparent indifference and calmness but he could not do it now\\nTime had changed him or Louisa had changed him  There was consciousness\\nof some sort or other  He looked very well not as if he had been\\nsuffering in health or spirits and he talked of Uppercross\\nof the Musgroves nay even of Louisa and had even a momentary look\\nof his own arch significance as he named her but yet it was\\nCaptain Wentworth not comfortable not easy not able to feign that he was\\n\\nIt did not surprise but it grieved Anne to observe that Elizabeth\\nwould not know him  She saw that he saw Elizabeth that Elizabeth saw him\\nthat there was complete internal recognition on each side\\nshe was convinced that he was ready to be acknowledged as an acquaintance\\nexpecting it and she had the pain of seeing her sister turn away\\nwith unalterable coldness\\n\\nLady Dalrymples carriage for which Miss Elliot was growing\\nvery impatient now drew up the servant came in to announce it\\nIt was beginning to rain again and altogether there was a delay\\nand a bustle and a talking which must make all the little crowd\\nin the shop understand that Lady Dalrymple was calling to convey\\nMiss Elliot  At last Miss Elliot and her friend unattended but\\nby the servant for there was no cousin returned were walking off\\nand Captain Wentworth watching them turned again to Anne\\nand by manner rather than words was offering his services to her\\n\\nI am much obliged to you was her answer but I am not going with them\\nThe carriage would not accommodate so many  I walk  I prefer walking\\n\\nBut it rains\\n\\nOh very little  Nothing that I regard\\n\\nAfter a moments pause he said  Though I came only yesterday\\nI have equipped myself properly for Bath already you see\\npointing to a new umbrella I wish you would make use of it\\nif you are determined to walk though I think it would be more prudent\\nto let me get you a chair\\n\\nShe was very much obliged to him but declined it all repeating\\nher conviction that the rain would come to nothing at present\\nand adding I am only waiting for Mr Elliot  He will be here in a moment\\nI am sure\\n\\nShe had hardly spoken the words when Mr Elliot walked in\\nCaptain Wentworth recollected him perfectly  There was no difference\\nbetween him and the man who had stood on the steps at Lyme\\nadmiring Anne as she passed except in the air and look and manner\\nof the privileged relation and friend  He came in with eagerness\\nappeared to see and think only of her apologised for his stay\\nwas grieved to have kept her waiting and anxious to get her away\\nwithout further loss of time and before the rain increased\\nand in another moment they walked off together her arm under his\\na gentle and embarrassed glance and a Good morning to you\\nbeing all that she had time for as she passed away\\n\\nAs soon as they were out of sight the ladies of Captain Wentworths party\\nbegan talking of them\\n\\nMr Elliot does not dislike his cousin I fancy\\n\\nOh no that is clear enough  One can guess what will happen there\\nHe is always with them half lives in the family I believe\\nWhat a very goodlooking man\\n\\nYes and Miss Atkinson who dined with him once at the Wallises\\nsays he is the most agreeable man she ever was in company with\\n\\nShe is pretty I think Anne Elliot very pretty when one comes\\nto look at her  It is not the fashion to say so but I confess\\nI admire her more than her sister\\n\\nOh so do I\\n\\nAnd so do I  No comparison  But the men are all wild after Miss Elliot\\nAnne is too delicate for them\\n\\nAnne would have been particularly obliged to her cousin if he would have\\nwalked by her side all the way to Camden Place without saying a word\\nShe had never found it so difficult to listen to him though nothing\\ncould exceed his solicitude and care and though his subjects\\nwere principally such as were wont to be always interesting\\npraise warm just and discriminating of Lady Russell\\nand insinuations highly rational against Mrs Clay  But just now\\nshe could think only of Captain Wentworth  She could not understand\\nhis present feelings whether he were really suffering much\\nfrom disappointment or not and till that point were settled\\nshe could not be quite herself\\n\\nShe hoped to be wise and reasonable in time but alas alas\\nshe must confess to herself that she was not wise yet\\n\\nAnother circumstance very essential for her to know was how long\\nhe meant to be in Bath he had not mentioned it or she could not\\nrecollect it  He might be only passing through  But it was more probable\\nthat he should be come to stay  In that case so liable as every body was\\nto meet every body in Bath Lady Russell would in all likelihood\\nsee him somewhere  Would she recollect him  How would it all be\\n\\nShe had already been obliged to tell Lady Russell that Louisa Musgrove\\nwas to marry Captain Benwick  It had cost her something to encounter\\nLady Russells surprise and now if she were by any chance\\nto be thrown into company with Captain Wentworth her imperfect knowledge\\nof the matter might add another shade of prejudice against him\\n\\nThe following morning Anne was out with her friend and for the first hour\\nin an incessant and fearful sort of watch for him in vain but at last\\nin returning down Pulteney Street she distinguished him\\non the right hand pavement at such a distance as to have him in view\\nthe greater part of the street  There were many other men about him\\nmany groups walking the same way but there was no mistaking him\\nShe looked instinctively at Lady Russell but not from any mad idea\\nof her recognising him so soon as she did herself  No it was\\nnot to be supposed that Lady Russell would perceive him till they\\nwere nearly opposite  She looked at her however from time to time\\nanxiously and when the moment approached which must point him out\\nthough not daring to look again for her own countenance she knew\\nwas unfit to be seen she was yet perfectly conscious of\\nLady Russells eyes being turned exactly in the direction for him\\nof her being in short intently observing him  She could thoroughly\\ncomprehend the sort of fascination he must possess over Lady Russells mind\\nthe difficulty it must be for her to withdraw her eyes the astonishment\\nshe must be feeling that eight or nine years should have passed over him\\nand in foreign climes and in active service too without robbing him\\nof one personal grace\\n\\nAt last Lady Russell drew back her head  Now how would she\\nspeak of him\\n\\nYou will wonder said she what has been fixing my eye so long\\nbut I was looking after some windowcurtains which Lady Alicia and\\nMrs Frankland were telling me of last night  They described\\nthe drawingroom windowcurtains of one of the houses on this\\nside of the way and this part of the street as being the handsomest\\nand best hung of any in Bath but could not recollect the exact number\\nand I have been trying to find out which it could be but I confess\\nI can see no curtains hereabouts that answer their description\\n\\nAnne sighed and blushed and smiled in pity and disdain\\neither at her friend or herself  The part which provoked her most\\nwas that in all this waste of foresight and caution she should have\\nlost the right moment for seeing whether he saw them\\n\\nA day or two passed without producing anything  The theatre or the rooms\\nwhere he was most likely to be were not fashionable enough\\nfor the Elliots whose evening amusements were solely in the\\nelegant stupidity of private parties in which they were getting\\nmore and more engaged and Anne wearied of such a state of stagnation\\nsick of knowing nothing and fancying herself stronger because\\nher strength was not tried was quite impatient for the concert evening\\nIt was a concert for the benefit of a person patronised by Lady Dalrymple\\nOf course they must attend  It was really expected to be a good one\\nand Captain Wentworth was very fond of music  If she could only have\\na few minutes conversation with him again she fancied she should\\nbe satisfied and as to the power of addressing him she felt all over\\ncourage if the opportunity occurred  Elizabeth had turned from him\\nLady Russell overlooked him her nerves were strengthened\\nby these circumstances she felt that she owed him attention\\n\\nShe had once partly promised Mrs Smith to spend the evening with her\\nbut in a short hurried call she excused herself and put it off\\nwith the more decided promise of a longer visit on the morrow\\nMrs Smith gave a most goodhumoured acquiescence\\n\\nBy all means said she only tell me all about it when you do come\\nWho is your party\\n\\nAnne named them all  Mrs Smith made no reply but when she was\\nleaving her said and with an expression half serious half arch\\nWell I heartily wish your concert may answer and do not fail me\\ntomorrow if you can come for I begin to have a foreboding\\nthat I may not have many more visits from you\\n\\nAnne was startled and confused but after standing in a moments suspense\\nwas obliged and not sorry to be obliged to hurry away\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 20\\n\\n\\nSir Walter his two daughters and Mrs Clay were the earliest\\nof all their party at the rooms in the evening and as Lady Dalrymple\\nmust be waited for they took their station by one of the fires\\nin the Octagon Room  But hardly were they so settled when the door\\nopened again and Captain Wentworth walked in alone  Anne was\\nthe nearest to him and making yet a little advance she instantly spoke\\nHe was preparing only to bow and pass on but her gentle How do you do\\nbrought him out of the straight line to stand near her and make enquiries\\nin return in spite of the formidable father and sister in the back ground\\nTheir being in the back ground was a support to Anne she knew nothing\\nof their looks and felt equal to everything which she believed\\nright to be done\\n\\nWhile they were speaking a whispering between her father and Elizabeth\\ncaught her ear  She could not distinguish but she must guess the subject\\nand on Captain Wentworths making a distant bow she comprehended\\nthat her father had judged so well as to give him that\\nsimple acknowledgement of acquaintance and she was just in time\\nby a side glance to see a slight curtsey from Elizabeth herself\\nThis though late and reluctant and ungracious was yet\\nbetter than nothing and her spirits improved\\n\\nAfter talking however of the weather and Bath and the concert\\ntheir conversation began to flag and so little was said at last\\nthat she was expecting him to go every moment but he did not\\nhe seemed in no hurry to leave her and presently with renewed spirit\\nwith a little smile a little glow he said\\n\\nI have hardly seen you since our day at Lyme  I am afraid you must have\\nsuffered from the shock and the more from its not overpowering you\\nat the time\\n\\nShe assured him that she had not\\n\\nIt was a frightful hour said he a frightful day and he\\npassed his hand across his eyes as if the remembrance were still\\ntoo painful but in a moment half smiling again added\\nThe day has produced some effects however has had some consequences\\nwhich must be considered as the very reverse of frightful\\nWhen you had the presence of mind to suggest that Benwick would be\\nthe properest person to fetch a surgeon you could have little idea\\nof his being eventually one of those most concerned in her recovery\\n\\nCertainly I could have none  But it appearsI should hope it would be\\na very happy match  There are on both sides good principles\\nand good temper\\n\\nYes said he looking not exactly forward but there I think\\nends the resemblance  With all my soul I wish them happy and rejoice\\nover every circumstance in favour of it  They have no difficulties\\nto contend with at home no opposition no caprice no delays\\nThe Musgroves are behaving like themselves most honourably and kindly\\nonly anxious with true parental hearts to promote their daughters comfort\\nAll this is much very much in favour of their happiness\\nmore than perhaps\\n\\nHe stopped  A sudden recollection seemed to occur and to give him\\nsome taste of that emotion which was reddening Annes cheeks\\nand fixing her eyes on the ground  After clearing his throat however\\nhe proceeded thus\\n\\nI confess that I do think there is a disparity too great a disparity\\nand in a point no less essential than mind  I regard Louisa Musgrove\\nas a very amiable sweettempered girl and not deficient in understanding\\nbut Benwick is something more  He is a clever man a reading man\\nand I confess that I do consider his attaching himself to her\\nwith some surprise  Had it been the effect of gratitude\\nhad he learnt to love her because he believed her to be preferring him\\nit would have been another thing  But I have no reason to suppose it so\\nIt seems on the contrary to have been a perfectly spontaneous\\nuntaught feeling on his side and this surprises me  A man like him\\nin his situation with a heart pierced wounded almost broken\\nFanny Harville was a very superior creature and his attachment to her\\nwas indeed attachment  A man does not recover from such\\na devotion of the heart to such a woman  He ought not he does not\\n\\nEither from the consciousness however that his friend had recovered\\nor from other consciousness he went no farther and Anne who\\nin spite of the agitated voice in which the latter part had been uttered\\nand in spite of all the various noises of the room the almost ceaseless\\nslam of the door and ceaseless buzz of persons walking through\\nhad distinguished every word was struck gratified confused\\nand beginning to breathe very quick and feel an hundred things\\nin a moment  It was impossible for her to enter on such a subject\\nand yet after a pause feeling the necessity of speaking\\nand having not the smallest wish for a total change she only deviated\\nso far as to say\\n\\nYou were a good while at Lyme I think\\n\\nAbout a fortnight  I could not leave it till Louisas doing well\\nwas quite ascertained  I had been too deeply concerned in the mischief\\nto be soon at peace  It had been my doing solely mine\\nShe would not have been obstinate if I had not been weak\\nThe country round Lyme is very fine  I walked and rode a great deal\\nand the more I saw the more I found to admire\\n\\nI should very much like to see Lyme again said Anne\\n\\nIndeed  I should not have supposed that you could have found\\nanything in Lyme to inspire such a feeling  The horror and distress\\nyou were involved in the stretch of mind the wear of spirits\\nI should have thought your last impressions of Lyme must have been\\nstrong disgust\\n\\nThe last hours were certainly very painful replied Anne\\nbut when pain is over the remembrance of it often becomes a pleasure\\nOne does not love a place the less for having suffered in it\\nunless it has been all suffering nothing but suffering which was\\nby no means the case at Lyme  We were only in anxiety and distress\\nduring the last two hours and previously there had been a great deal\\nof enjoyment  So much novelty and beauty I have travelled so little\\nthat every fresh place would be interesting to me but there is real beauty\\nat Lyme and in short with a faint blush at some recollections\\naltogether my impressions of the place are very agreeable\\n\\nAs she ceased the entrance door opened again and the very party appeared\\nfor whom they were waiting  Lady Dalrymple Lady Dalrymple\\nwas the rejoicing sound and with all the eagerness compatible\\nwith anxious elegance Sir Walter and his two ladies stepped forward\\nto meet her  Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret escorted by Mr Elliot\\nand Colonel Wallis who had happened to arrive nearly at the same instant\\nadvanced into the room  The others joined them and it was\\na group in which Anne found herself also necessarily included\\nShe was divided from Captain Wentworth  Their interesting\\nalmost too interesting conversation must be broken up for a time\\nbut slight was the penance compared with the happiness which brought it on\\nShe had learnt in the last ten minutes more of his feelings\\ntowards Louisa more of all his feelings than she dared to think of\\nand she gave herself up to the demands of the party to the needful\\ncivilities of the moment with exquisite though agitated sensations\\nShe was in good humour with all  She had received ideas which\\ndisposed her to be courteous and kind to all and to pity every one\\nas being less happy than herself\\n\\nThe delightful emotions were a little subdued when on stepping back\\nfrom the group to be joined again by Captain Wentworth she saw\\nthat he was gone  She was just in time to see him turn into\\nthe Concert Room  He was gone he had disappeared she felt\\na moments regret  But they should meet again  He would look for her\\nhe would find her out before the evening were over and at present\\nperhaps it was as well to be asunder  She was in need of\\na little interval for recollection\\n\\nUpon Lady Russells appearance soon afterwards the whole party\\nwas collected and all that remained was to marshal themselves\\nand proceed into the Concert Room and be of all the consequence\\nin their power draw as many eyes excite as many whispers\\nand disturb as many people as they could\\n\\nVery very happy were both Elizabeth and Anne Elliot as they walked in\\nElizabeth arm in arm with Miss Carteret and looking on the broad back\\nof the dowager Viscountess Dalrymple before her had nothing to wish for\\nwhich did not seem within her reach and Annebut it would be\\nan insult to the nature of Annes felicity to draw any comparison\\nbetween it and her sisters the origin of one all selfish vanity\\nof the other all generous attachment\\n\\nAnne saw nothing thought nothing of the brilliancy of the room\\nHer happiness was from within  Her eyes were bright and her cheeks glowed\\nbut she knew nothing about it  She was thinking only of\\nthe last half hour and as they passed to their seats her mind took\\na hasty range over it  His choice of subjects his expressions\\nand still more his manner and look had been such as she could see\\nin only one light  His opinion of Louisa Musgroves inferiority\\nan opinion which he had seemed solicitous to give his wonder\\nat Captain Benwick his feelings as to a first strong attachment\\nsentences begun which he could not finish his half averted eyes\\nand more than half expressive glance all all declared that he had\\na heart returning to her at least that anger resentment avoidance\\nwere no more and that they were succeeded not merely by friendship\\nand regard but by the tenderness of the past  Yes some share of\\nthe tenderness of the past  She could not contemplate the change\\nas implying less  He must love her\\n\\nThese were thoughts with their attendant visions which occupied\\nand flurried her too much to leave her any power of observation\\nand she passed along the room without having a glimpse of him\\nwithout even trying to discern him  When their places were determined on\\nand they were all properly arranged she looked round to see\\nif he should happen to be in the same part of the room but he was not\\nher eye could not reach him and the concert being just opening\\nshe must consent for a time to be happy in a humbler way\\n\\nThe party was divided and disposed of on two contiguous benches\\nAnne was among those on the foremost and Mr Elliot had manoeuvred so well\\nwith the assistance of his friend Colonel Wallis as to have a seat by her\\nMiss Elliot surrounded by her cousins and the principal object\\nof Colonel Walliss gallantry was quite contented\\n\\nAnnes mind was in a most favourable state for the entertainment\\nof the evening it was just occupation enough  she had feelings for\\nthe tender spirits for the gay attention for the scientific\\nand patience for the wearisome and had never liked a concert better\\nat least during the first act  Towards the close of it\\nin the interval succeeding an Italian song she explained\\nthe words of the song to Mr Elliot  They had a concert bill between them\\n\\nThis said she is nearly the sense or rather the meaning of the words\\nfor certainly the sense of an Italian lovesong must not be talked of\\nbut it is as nearly the meaning as I can give for I do not pretend\\nto understand the language  I am a very poor Italian scholar\\n\\nYes yes I see you are  I see you know nothing of the matter\\nYou have only knowledge enough of the language to translate at sight\\nthese inverted transposed curtailed Italian lines into clear\\ncomprehensible elegant English  You need not say anything more\\nof your ignorance  Here is complete proof\\n\\nI will not oppose such kind politeness but I should be sorry to be\\nexamined by a real proficient\\n\\nI have not had the pleasure of visiting in Camden Place so long\\nreplied he without knowing something of Miss Anne Elliot\\nand I do regard her as one who is too modest for the world in general\\nto be aware of half her accomplishments and too highly accomplished\\nfor modesty to be natural in any other woman\\n\\nFor shame for shame this is too much flattery  I forget what we are\\nto have next turning to the bill\\n\\nPerhaps said Mr Elliot speaking low I have had a longer acquaintance\\nwith your character than you are aware of\\n\\nIndeed  How so  You can have been acquainted with it only since\\nI came to Bath excepting as you might hear me previously spoken of\\nin my own family\\n\\nI knew you by report long before you came to Bath  I had heard you\\ndescribed by those who knew you intimately  I have been acquainted\\nwith you by character many years  Your person your disposition\\naccomplishments manner they were all present to me\\n\\nMr Elliot was not disappointed in the interest he hoped to raise\\nNo one can withstand the charm of such a mystery  To have been\\ndescribed long ago to a recent acquaintance by nameless people\\nis irresistible and Anne was all curiosity  She wondered\\nand questioned him eagerly but in vain  He delighted in being asked\\nbut he would not tell\\n\\nNo no some time or other perhaps but not now  He would mention\\nno names now but such he could assure her had been the fact\\nHe had many years ago received such a description of Miss Anne Elliot\\nas had inspired him with the highest idea of her merit and excited\\nthe warmest curiosity to know her\\n\\nAnne could think of no one so likely to have spoken with\\npartiality of her many years ago as the Mr Wentworth of Monkford\\nCaptain Wentworths brother  He might have been in Mr Elliots company\\nbut she had not courage to ask the question\\n\\nThe name of Anne Elliot said he has long had an interesting sound to me\\nVery long has it possessed a charm over my fancy and if I dared\\nI would breathe my wishes that the name might never change\\n\\nSuch she believed were his words but scarcely had she\\nreceived their sound than her attention was caught by other sounds\\nimmediately behind her which rendered every thing else trivial\\nHer father and Lady Dalrymple were speaking\\n\\nA welllooking man said Sir Walter a very welllooking man\\n\\nA very fine young man indeed said Lady Dalrymple  More air\\nthan one often sees in Bath  Irish I dare say\\n\\nNo I just know his name  A bowing acquaintance  Wentworth\\nCaptain Wentworth of the navy  His sister married my tenant\\nin Somersetshire the Croft who rents Kellynch\\n\\nBefore Sir Walter had reached this point Annes eyes had caught\\nthe right direction and distinguished Captain Wentworth standing\\namong a cluster of men at a little distance  As her eyes fell on him\\nhis seemed to be withdrawn from her  It had that appearance\\nIt seemed as if she had been one moment too late and as long as she\\ndared observe he did not look again  but the performance\\nwas recommencing and she was forced to seem to restore her attention\\nto the orchestra and look straight forward\\n\\nWhen she could give another glance he had moved away  He could not have\\ncome nearer to her if he would she was so surrounded and shut in\\nbut she would rather have caught his eye\\n\\nMr Elliots speech too distressed her  She had no longer\\nany inclination to talk to him  She wished him not so near her\\n\\nThe first act was over  Now she hoped for some beneficial change\\nand after a period of nothingsaying amongst the party some of them\\ndid decide on going in quest of tea  Anne was one of the few who\\ndid not choose to move  She remained in her seat and so did Lady Russell\\nbut she had the pleasure of getting rid of Mr Elliot and she did not mean\\nwhatever she might feel on Lady Russells account to shrink from\\nconversation with Captain Wentworth if he gave her the opportunity\\nShe was persuaded by Lady Russells countenance that she had seen him\\n\\nHe did not come however  Anne sometimes fancied she discerned him\\nat a distance but he never came  The anxious interval\\nwore away unproductively  The others returned the room filled again\\nbenches were reclaimed and repossessed and another hour of pleasure\\nor of penance was to be sat out another hour of music was to give\\ndelight or the gapes as real or affected taste for it prevailed\\nTo Anne it chiefly wore the prospect of an hour of agitation\\nShe could not quit that room in peace without seeing Captain Wentworth\\nonce more without the interchange of one friendly look\\n\\nIn resettling themselves there were now many changes the result of which\\nwas favourable for her  Colonel Wallis declined sitting down again\\nand Mr Elliot was invited by Elizabeth and Miss Carteret in a manner\\nnot to be refused to sit between them and by some other removals\\nand a little scheming of her own  Anne was enabled to place herself\\nmuch nearer the end of the bench than she had been before\\nmuch more within reach of a passerby  She could not do so\\nwithout comparing herself with Miss Larolles the inimitable Miss Larolles\\nbut still she did it and not with much happier effect\\nthough by what seemed prosperity in the shape of an early abdication\\nin her next neighbours she found herself at the very end of the bench\\nbefore the concert closed\\n\\nSuch was her situation with a vacant space at hand when Captain Wentworth\\nwas again in sight  She saw him not far off  He saw her too\\nyet he looked grave and seemed irresolute and only by very slow degrees\\ncame at last near enough to speak to her  She felt that something\\nmust be the matter  The change was indubitable  The difference\\nbetween his present air and what it had been in the Octagon Room\\nwas strikingly great  Why was it  She thought of her father\\nof Lady Russell  Could there have been any unpleasant glances\\nHe began by speaking of the concert gravely more like the Captain\\nWentworth of Uppercross owned himself disappointed had expected singing\\nand in short must confess that he should not be sorry when it was over\\nAnne replied and spoke in defence of the performance so well\\nand yet in allowance for his feelings so pleasantly that his countenance\\nimproved and he replied again with almost a smile  They talked\\nfor a few minutes more the improvement held he even looked down\\ntowards the bench as if he saw a place on it well worth occupying\\nwhen at that moment a touch on her shoulder obliged Anne to turn round\\nIt came from Mr Elliot  He begged her pardon but she must be applied to\\nto explain Italian again  Miss Carteret was very anxious to have\\na general idea of what was next to be sung  Anne could not refuse\\nbut never had she sacrificed to politeness with a more suffering spirit\\n\\nA few minutes though as few as possible were inevitably consumed\\nand when her own mistress again when able to turn and look\\nas she had done before she found herself accosted by Captain Wentworth\\nin a reserved yet hurried sort of farewell  He must wish her good night\\nhe was going he should get home as fast as he could\\n\\nIs not this song worth staying for said Anne suddenly struck\\nby an idea which made her yet more anxious to be encouraging\\n\\nNo he replied impressively there is nothing worth my staying for\\nand he was gone directly\\n\\nJealousy of Mr Elliot  It was the only intelligible motive\\nCaptain Wentworth jealous of her affection  Could she have believed it\\na week ago three hours ago  For a moment the gratification was exquisite\\nBut alas there were very different thoughts to succeed\\nHow was such jealousy to be quieted  How was the truth to reach him\\nHow in all the peculiar disadvantages of their respective situations\\nwould he ever learn of her real sentiments  It was misery to think\\nof Mr Elliots attentions  Their evil was incalculable\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 21\\n\\n\\nAnne recollected with pleasure the next morning her promise\\nof going to Mrs Smith meaning that it should engage her from home\\nat the time when Mr Elliot would be most likely to call for to avoid\\nMr Elliot was almost a first object\\n\\nShe felt a great deal of goodwill towards him  In spite of\\nthe mischief of his attentions she owed him gratitude and regard\\nperhaps compassion  She could not help thinking much of the extraordinary\\ncircumstances attending their acquaintance of the right which\\nhe seemed to have to interest her by everything in situation\\nby his own sentiments by his early prepossession  It was altogether\\nvery extraordinary flattering but painful  There was much to regret\\nHow she might have felt had there been no Captain Wentworth in the case\\nwas not worth enquiry for there was a Captain Wentworth\\nand be the conclusion of the present suspense good or bad\\nher affection would be his for ever  Their union she believed\\ncould not divide her more from other men than their final separation\\n\\nPrettier musings of highwrought love and eternal constancy\\ncould never have passed along the streets of Bath than Anne\\nwas sporting with from Camden Place to Westgate Buildings\\nIt was almost enough to spread purification and perfume all the way\\n\\nShe was sure of a pleasant reception and her friend seemed this morning\\nparticularly obliged to her for coming seemed hardly to have expected her\\nthough it had been an appointment\\n\\nAn account of the concert was immediately claimed and Annes recollections\\nof the concert were quite happy enough to animate her features\\nand make her rejoice to talk of it  All that she could tell\\nshe told most gladly but the all was little for one who had been there\\nand unsatisfactory for such an enquirer as Mrs Smith who had\\nalready heard through the short cut of a laundress and a waiter\\nrather more of the general success and produce of the evening\\nthan Anne could relate and who now asked in vain for several particulars\\nof the company  Everybody of any consequence or notoriety in Bath\\nwas well know by name to Mrs Smith\\n\\nThe little Durands were there I conclude said she with their mouths\\nopen to catch the music like unfledged sparrows ready to be fed\\nThey never miss a concert\\n\\nYes I did not see them myself but I heard Mr Elliot say they were\\nin the room\\n\\nThe Ibbotsons were they there and the two new beauties\\nwith the tall Irish officer who is talked of for one of them\\n\\nI do not know  I do not think they were\\n\\nOld Lady Mary Maclean  I need not ask after her  She never misses\\nI know and you must have seen her  She must have been in your own circle\\nfor as you went with Lady Dalrymple you were in the seats of grandeur\\nround the orchestra of course\\n\\nNo that was what I dreaded  It would have been very unpleasant to me\\nin every respect  But happily Lady Dalrymple always chooses\\nto be farther off and we were exceedingly well placed that is\\nfor hearing I must not say for seeing because I appear to have seen\\nvery little\\n\\nOh you saw enough for your own amusement  I can understand\\nThere is a sort of domestic enjoyment to be known even in a crowd\\nand this you had  You were a large party in yourselves\\nand you wanted nothing beyond\\n\\nBut I ought to have looked about me more said Anne conscious\\nwhile she spoke that there had in fact been no want of looking about\\nthat the object only had been deficient\\n\\nNo no you were better employed  You need not tell me that you\\nhad a pleasant evening  I see it in your eye  I perfectly see\\nhow the hours passed  that you had always something agreeable\\nto listen to  In the intervals of the concert it was conversation\\n\\nAnne half smiled and said Do you see that in my eye\\n\\nYes I do  Your countenance perfectly informs me that you were\\nin company last night with the person whom you think the most agreeable\\nin the world the person who interests you at this present time\\nmore than all the rest of the world put together\\n\\nA blush overspread Annes cheeks  She could say nothing\\n\\nAnd such being the case continued Mrs Smith after a short pause\\nI hope you believe that I do know how to value your kindness\\nin coming to me this morning  It is really very good of you\\nto come and sit with me when you must have so many pleasanter demands\\nupon your time\\n\\nAnne heard nothing of this  She was still in the astonishment and\\nconfusion excited by her friends penetration unable to imagine\\nhow any report of Captain Wentworth could have reached her\\nAfter another short silence\\n\\nPray said Mrs Smith is Mr Elliot aware of your acquaintance with me\\nDoes he know that I am in Bath\\n\\nMr Elliot repeated Anne looking up surprised  A moments reflection\\nshewed her the mistake she had been under  She caught it instantaneously\\nand recovering her courage with the feeling of safety soon added\\nmore composedly Are you acquainted with Mr Elliot\\n\\nI have been a good deal acquainted with him replied Mrs Smith gravely\\nbut it seems worn out now  It is a great while since we met\\n\\nI was not at all aware of this  You never mentioned it before\\nHad I known it I would have had the pleasure of talking to him about you\\n\\nTo confess the truth said Mrs Smith assuming her usual\\nair of cheerfulness that is exactly the pleasure I want you to have\\nI want you to talk about me to Mr Elliot  I want your interest with him\\nHe can be of essential service to me and if you would have the goodness\\nmy dear Miss Elliot to make it an object to yourself\\nof course it is done\\n\\nI should be extremely happy I hope you cannot doubt my willingness\\nto be of even the slightest use to you replied Anne but I suspect\\nthat you are considering me as having a higher claim on Mr Elliot\\na greater right to influence him than is really the case\\nI am sure you have somehow or other imbibed such a notion\\nYou must consider me only as Mr Elliots relation  If in that light\\nthere is anything which you suppose his cousin might fairly ask of him\\nI beg you would not hesitate to employ me\\n\\nMrs Smith gave her a penetrating glance and then smiling said\\n\\nI have been a little premature I perceive I beg your pardon\\nI ought to have waited for official information  But now my dear\\nMiss Elliot as an old friend do give me a hint as to when I may speak\\nNext week  To be sure by next week I may be allowed to\\nthink it all settled and build my own selfish schemes on\\nMr Elliots good fortune\\n\\nNo replied Anne nor next week nor next nor next\\nI assure you that nothing of the sort you are thinking of\\nwill be settled any week  I am not going to marry Mr Elliot\\nI should like to know why you imagine I am\\n\\nMrs Smith looked at her again looked earnestly smiled\\nshook her head and exclaimed\\n\\nNow how I do wish I understood you  How I do wish I knew\\nwhat you were at  I have a great idea that you do not design to be cruel\\nwhen the right moment occurs  Till it does come you know\\nwe women never mean to have anybody  It is a thing of course among us\\nthat every man is refused till he offers  But why should you be cruel\\nLet me plead for mypresent friend I cannot call him but for\\nmy former friend  Where can you look for a more suitable match\\nWhere could you expect a more gentlemanlike agreeable man\\nLet me recommend Mr Elliot  I am sure you hear nothing but good of him\\nfrom Colonel Wallis and who can know him better than Colonel Wallis\\n\\nMy dear Mrs Smith Mr Elliots wife has not been dead much above\\nhalf a year  He ought not to be supposed to be paying his addresses\\nto any one\\n\\nOh if these are your only objections cried Mrs Smith archly\\nMr Elliot is safe and I shall give myself no more trouble about him\\nDo not forget me when you are married thats all  Let him know me to be\\na friend of yours and then he will think little of the trouble required\\nwhich it is very natural for him now with so many affairs and engagements\\nof his own to avoid and get rid of as he can very natural perhaps\\nNinetynine out of a hundred would do the same  Of course\\nhe cannot be aware of the importance to me  Well my dear Miss Elliot\\nI hope and trust you will be very happy  Mr Elliot has sense\\nto understand the value of such a woman  Your peace will not be\\nshipwrecked as mine has been  You are safe in all worldly matters\\nand safe in his character  He will not be led astray he will not be\\nmisled by others to his ruin\\n\\nNo said Anne I can readily believe all that of my cousin\\nHe seems to have a calm decided temper not at all open\\nto dangerous impressions  I consider him with great respect\\nI have no reason from any thing that has fallen within my observation\\nto do otherwise  But I have not known him long and he is not a man\\nI think to be known intimately soon  Will not this manner\\nof speaking of him Mrs Smith convince you that he is nothing to me\\nSurely this must be calm enough  And upon my word he is nothing to me\\nShould he ever propose to me which I have very little reason to imagine\\nhe has any thought of doing I shall not accept him  I assure you\\nI shall not  I assure you Mr Elliot had not the share which\\nyou have been supposing in whatever pleasure the concert\\nof last night might afford  not Mr Elliot it is not Mr Elliot that\\n\\nShe stopped regretting with a deep blush that she had implied so much\\nbut less would hardly have been sufficient  Mrs Smith would hardly\\nhave believed so soon in Mr Elliots failure but from the perception\\nof there being a somebody else  As it was she instantly submitted\\nand with all the semblance of seeing nothing beyond and Anne\\neager to escape farther notice was impatient to know why Mrs Smith\\nshould have fancied she was to marry Mr Elliot where she could have\\nreceived the idea or from whom she could have heard it\\n\\nDo tell me how it first came into your head\\n\\nIt first came into my head replied Mrs Smith upon finding how much\\nyou were together and feeling it to be the most probable thing\\nin the world to be wished for by everybody belonging to either of you\\nand you may depend upon it that all your acquaintance have disposed of you\\nin the same way  But I never heard it spoken of till two days ago\\n\\nAnd has it indeed been spoken of\\n\\nDid you observe the woman who opened the door to you when\\nyou called yesterday\\n\\nNo  Was not it Mrs Speed as usual or the maid  I observed\\nno one in particular\\n\\nIt was my friend Mrs Rooke Nurse Rooke who bythebye\\nhad a great curiosity to see you and was delighted to be in the way\\nto let you in  She came away from Marlborough Buildings only on Sunday\\nand she it was who told me you were to marry Mr Elliot\\nShe had had it from Mrs Wallis herself which did not seem bad authority\\nShe sat an hour with me on Monday evening and gave me the whole history\\nThe whole history repeated Anne laughing  She could not make\\na very long history I think of one such little article\\nof unfounded news\\n\\nMrs Smith said nothing\\n\\nBut continued Anne presently though there is no truth in my having\\nthis claim on Mr Elliot I should be extremely happy to be of use to you\\nin any way that I could  Shall I mention to him your being in Bath\\nShall I take any message\\n\\nNo I thank you  no certainly not  In the warmth of the moment\\nand under a mistaken impression I might perhaps have endeavoured\\nto interest you in some circumstances but not now  No I thank you\\nI have nothing to trouble you with\\n\\nI think you spoke of having known Mr Elliot many years\\n\\nI did\\n\\nNot before he was married I suppose\\n\\nYes he was not married when I knew him first\\n\\nAndwere you much acquainted\\n\\nIntimately\\n\\nIndeed  Then do tell me what he was at that time of life\\nI have a great curiosity to know what Mr Elliot was as a very young man\\nWas he at all such as he appears now\\n\\nI have not seen Mr Elliot these three years was Mrs Smiths answer\\ngiven so gravely that it was impossible to pursue the subject farther\\nand Anne felt that she had gained nothing but an increase of curiosity\\nThey were both silent  Mrs Smith very thoughtful  At last\\n\\nI beg your pardon my dear Miss Elliot she cried in her\\nnatural tone of cordiality I beg your pardon for the short answers\\nI have been giving you but I have been uncertain what I ought to do\\nI have been doubting and considering as to what I ought to tell you\\nThere were many things to be taken into the account  One hates\\nto be officious to be giving bad impressions making mischief\\nEven the smooth surface of familyunion seems worth preserving\\nthough there may be nothing durable beneath  However I have determined\\nI think I am right I think you ought to be made acquainted\\nwith Mr Elliots real character  Though I fully believe that\\nat present you have not the smallest intention of accepting him\\nthere is no saying what may happen  You might some time or other\\nbe differently affected towards him  Hear the truth therefore\\nnow while you are unprejudiced  Mr Elliot is a man without heart\\nor conscience a designing wary coldblooded being who thinks\\nonly of himself whom for his own interest or ease would be guilty\\nof any cruelty or any treachery that could be perpetrated without\\nrisk of his general character  He has no feeling for others\\nThose whom he has been the chief cause of leading into ruin\\nhe can neglect and desert without the smallest compunction\\nHe is totally beyond the reach of any sentiment of justice or compassion\\nOh he is black at heart hollow and black\\n\\nAnnes astonished air and exclamation of wonder made her pause\\nand in a calmer manner she added\\n\\nMy expressions startle you  You must allow for an injured angry woman\\nBut I will try to command myself  I will not abuse him\\nI will only tell you what I have found him  Facts shall speak\\nHe was the intimate friend of my dear husband who trusted and loved him\\nand thought him as good as himself  The intimacy had been formed\\nbefore our marriage  I found them most intimate friends and I too\\nbecame excessively pleased with Mr Elliot and entertained\\nthe highest opinion of him  At nineteen you know one does not\\nthink very seriously but Mr Elliot appeared to me quite as good as others\\nand much more agreeable than most others and we were almost\\nalways together  We were principally in town living in very good style\\nHe was then the inferior in circumstances he was then the poor one\\nhe had chambers in the Temple and it was as much as he could do\\nto support the appearance of a gentleman  He had always a home\\nwith us whenever he chose it he was always welcome he was like a brother\\nMy poor Charles who had the finest most generous spirit in the world\\nwould have divided his last farthing with him and I know that his purse\\nwas open to him I know that he often assisted him\\n\\nThis must have been about that very period of Mr Elliots life\\nsaid Anne which has always excited my particular curiosity\\nIt must have been about the same time that he became known to\\nmy father and sister  I never knew him myself I only heard of him\\nbut there was a something in his conduct then with regard to\\nmy father and sister and afterwards in the circumstances of his marriage\\nwhich I never could quite reconcile with present times  It seemed\\nto announce a different sort of man\\n\\nI know it all I know it all cried Mrs Smith  He had been\\nintroduced to Sir Walter and your sister before I was acquainted with him\\nbut I heard him speak of them for ever  I know he was invited\\nand encouraged and I know he did not choose to go  I can satisfy you\\nperhaps on points which you would little expect and as to his marriage\\nI knew all about it at the time  I was privy to all the fors and againsts\\nI was the friend to whom he confided his hopes and plans and though\\nI did not know his wife previously her inferior situation in society\\nindeed rendered that impossible yet I knew her all her life afterwards\\nor at least till within the last two years of her life and can answer\\nany question you may wish to put\\n\\nNay said Anne I have no particular enquiry to make about her\\nI have always understood they were not a happy couple  But I should\\nlike to know why at that time of his life he should slight\\nmy fathers acquaintance as he did  My father was certainly disposed\\nto take very kind and proper notice of him  Why did Mr Elliot draw back\\n\\nMr Elliot replied Mrs Smith at that period of his life\\nhad one object in view  to make his fortune and by a rather quicker\\nprocess than the law  He was determined to make it by marriage\\nHe was determined at least not to mar it by an imprudent marriage\\nand I know it was his belief whether justly or not of course\\nI cannot decide that your father and sister in their civilities\\nand invitations were designing a match between the heir\\nand the young lady and it was impossible that such a match\\nshould have answered his ideas of wealth and independence\\nThat was his motive for drawing back I can assure you\\nHe told me the whole story  He had no concealments with me\\nIt was curious that having just left you behind me in Bath\\nmy first and principal acquaintance on marrying should be your cousin\\nand that through him I should be continually hearing of your father\\nand sister  He described one Miss Elliot and I thought\\nvery affectionately of the other\\n\\nPerhaps cried Anne struck by a sudden idea you sometimes\\nspoke of me to Mr Elliot\\n\\nTo be sure I did very often  I used to boast of my own Anne Elliot\\nand vouch for your being a very different creature from\\n\\nShe checked herself just in time\\n\\nThis accounts for something which Mr Elliot said last night\\ncried Anne  This explains it  I found he had been used to hear of me\\nI could not comprehend how  What wild imaginations one forms where\\ndear self is concerned  How sure to be mistaken  But I beg your pardon\\nI have interrupted you  Mr Elliot married then completely for money\\nThe circumstances probably which first opened your eyes\\nto his character\\n\\nMrs Smith hesitated a little here  Oh those things are too common\\nWhen one lives in the world a man or womans marrying for money\\nis too common to strike one as it ought  I was very young\\nand associated only with the young and we were a thoughtless\\ngay set without any strict rules of conduct  We lived for enjoyment\\nI think differently now time and sickness and sorrow have given me\\nother notions but at that period I must own I saw nothing reprehensible\\nin what Mr Elliot was doing  To do the best for himself\\npassed as a duty\\n\\nBut was not she a very low woman\\n\\nYes which I objected to but he would not regard  Money money\\nwas all that he wanted  Her father was a grazier her grandfather\\nhad been a butcher but that was all nothing  She was a fine woman\\nhad had a decent education was brought forward by some cousins\\nthrown by chance into Mr Elliots company and fell in love with him\\nand not a difficulty or a scruple was there on his side\\nwith respect to her birth  All his caution was spent in being secured\\nof the real amount of her fortune before he committed himself\\nDepend upon it whatever esteem Mr Elliot may have for his own situation\\nin life now as a young man he had not the smallest value for it\\nHis chance for the Kellynch estate was something but all the honour\\nof the family he held as cheap as dirt  I have often heard him declare\\nthat if baronetcies were saleable anybody should have his\\nfor fifty pounds arms and motto name and livery included\\nbut I will not pretend to repeat half that I used to hear him say\\non that subject  It would not be fair and yet you ought to have proof\\nfor what is all this but assertion and you shall have proof\\n\\nIndeed my dear Mrs Smith I want none cried Anne  You have asserted\\nnothing contradictory to what Mr Elliot appeared to be some years ago\\nThis is all in confirmation rather of what we used to hear and believe\\nI am more curious to know why he should be so different now\\n\\nBut for my satisfaction if you will have the goodness to ring for Mary\\nstay  I am sure you will have the still greater goodness of\\ngoing yourself into my bedroom and bringing me the small inlaid box\\nwhich you will find on the upper shelf of the closet\\n\\nAnne seeing her friend to be earnestly bent on it did as she was desired\\nThe box was brought and placed before her and Mrs Smith sighing over it\\nas she unlocked it said\\n\\nThis is full of papers belonging to him to my husband\\na small portion only of what I had to look over when I lost him\\nThe letter I am looking for was one written by Mr Elliot to him\\nbefore our marriage and happened to be saved why one can hardly imagine\\nBut he was careless and immethodical like other men about those things\\nand when I came to examine his papers I found it with others\\nstill more trivial from different people scattered here and there\\nwhile many letters and memorandums of real importance had been destroyed\\nHere it is I would not burn it because being even then very little\\nsatisfied with Mr Elliot I was determined to preserve every document\\nof former intimacy  I have now another motive for being glad\\nthat I can produce it\\n\\nThis was the letter directed to Charles Smith Esq Tunbridge Wells\\nand dated from London as far back as July 1803 \\n\\nDear SmithI have received yours  Your kindness almost overpowers me\\nI wish nature had made such hearts as yours more common but I have\\nlived threeandtwenty years in the world and have seen none like it\\nAt present believe me I have no need of your services\\nbeing in cash again  Give me joy  I have got rid of Sir Walter and Miss\\nThey are gone back to Kellynch and almost made me swear to visit them\\nthis summer but my first visit to Kellynch will be with a surveyor\\nto tell me how to bring it with best advantage to the hammer\\nThe baronet nevertheless is not unlikely to marry again\\nhe is quite fool enough  If he does however they will leave me in peace\\nwhich may be a decent equivalent  for the reversion  He is worse\\nthan last year\\n\\nI wish I had any name but Elliot  I am sick of it  The name of Walter\\nI can drop thank God and I desire you will never insult me\\nwith my second W again meaning for the rest of my life\\nto be only yours trulyWm Elliot\\n\\nSuch a letter could not be read without putting Anne in a glow\\nand Mrs Smith observing the high colour in her face said\\n\\nThe language I know is highly disrespectful  Though I have forgot\\nthe exact terms I have a perfect impression of the general meaning\\nBut it shows you the man  Mark his professions to my poor husband\\nCan any thing be stronger\\n\\nAnne could not immediately get over the shock and mortification\\nof finding such words applied to her father  She was obliged to recollect\\nthat her seeing the letter was a violation of the laws of honour\\nthat no one ought to be judged or to be known by such testimonies\\nthat no private correspondence could bear the eye of others\\nbefore she could recover calmness enough to return the letter\\nwhich she had been meditating over and say\\n\\nThank you  This is full proof undoubtedly proof of every thing\\nyou were saying  But why be acquainted with us now\\n\\nI can explain this too cried Mrs Smith smiling\\n\\nCan you really\\n\\nYes  I have shewn you Mr Elliot as he was a dozen years ago\\nand I will shew him as he is now  I cannot produce written proof again\\nbut I can give as authentic oral testimony as you can desire of what\\nhe is now wanting and what he is now doing  He is no hypocrite now\\nHe truly wants to marry you  His present attentions to your family\\nare very sincere  quite from the heart  I will give you my authority\\nhis friend Colonel Wallis\\n\\nColonel Wallis you are acquainted with him\\n\\nNo  It does not come to me in quite so direct a line as that\\nit takes a bend or two but nothing of consequence  The stream\\nis as good as at first the little rubbish it collects in the turnings\\nis easily moved away  Mr Elliot talks unreservedly to Colonel Wallis\\nof his views on you which said Colonel Wallis I imagine to be\\nin himself a sensible careful discerning sort of character\\nbut Colonel Wallis has a very pretty silly wife to whom\\nhe tells things which he had better not and he repeats it all to her\\nShe in the overflowing spirits of her recovery repeats it all\\nto her nurse and the nurse  knowing my acquaintance with you\\nvery naturally brings it all to me  On Monday evening my good friend\\nMrs Rooke let me thus much into the secrets of Marlborough Buildings\\nWhen I talked of a whole history therefore you see I was\\nnot romancing so much as you supposed\\n\\nMy dear Mrs Smith your authority is deficient  This will not do\\nMr Elliots having any views on me will not in the least account\\nfor the efforts he made towards a reconciliation with my father\\nThat was all prior to my coming to Bath  I found them on\\nthe most friendly terms when I arrived\\n\\nI know you did I know it all perfectly but\\n\\nIndeed Mrs Smith we must not expect to get real information\\nin such a line  Facts or opinions which are to pass through the hands\\nof so many to be misconceived by folly in one and ignorance in another\\ncan hardly have much truth left\\n\\nOnly give me a hearing  You will soon be able to judge of\\nthe general credit due by listening to some particulars\\nwhich you can yourself immediately contradict or confirm\\nNobody supposes that you were his first inducement  He had seen you\\nindeed before he came to Bath and admired you but without\\nknowing it to be you  So says my historian at least  Is this true\\nDid he see you last summer or autumn somewhere down in the west\\nto use her own words without knowing it to be you\\n\\nHe certainly did  So far it is very true  At Lyme\\nI happened to be at Lyme\\n\\nWell continued Mrs Smith triumphantly grant my friend the credit\\ndue to the establishment of the first point asserted  He saw you then\\nat Lyme and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleased\\nto meet with you again in Camden Place as Miss Anne Elliot\\nand from that moment I have no doubt had a double motive\\nin his visits there  But there was another and an earlier\\nwhich I will now explain  If there is anything in my story which you know\\nto be either false or improbable stop me  My account states\\nthat your sisters friend the lady now staying with you\\nwhom I have heard you mention came to Bath with Miss Elliot and Sir Walter\\nas long ago as September in short when they first came themselves\\nand has been staying there ever since that she is a clever insinuating\\nhandsome woman poor and plausible and altogether such in situation\\nand manner as to give a general idea among Sir Walters acquaintance\\nof her meaning to be Lady Elliot and as general a surprise\\nthat Miss Elliot should be apparently blind to the danger\\n\\nHere Mrs Smith paused a moment but Anne had not a word to say\\nand she continued\\n\\nThis was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family\\nlong before you returned to it and Colonel Wallis had his eye\\nupon your father enough to be sensible of it though he did not then\\nvisit in Camden Place but his regard for Mr Elliot gave him an interest\\nin watching all that was going on there and when Mr Elliot came to Bath\\nfor a day or two as he happened to do a little before Christmas\\nColonel Wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of things\\nand the reports beginning to prevail  Now you are to understand\\nthat time had worked a very material change in Mr Elliots opinions\\nas to the value of a baronetcy  Upon all points of blood and connexion\\nhe is a completely altered man  Having long had as much money\\nas he could spend nothing to wish for on the side of avarice\\nor indulgence he has been gradually learning to pin his happiness\\nupon the consequence he is heir to  I thought it coming on\\nbefore our acquaintance ceased but it is now a confirmed feeling\\nHe cannot bear the idea of not being Sir William  You may guess\\ntherefore that the news he heard from his friend could not be\\nvery agreeable and you may guess what it produced the resolution\\nof coming back to Bath as soon as possible and of fixing himself here\\nfor a time with the view of renewing his former acquaintance\\nand recovering such a footing in the family as might give him the means\\nof ascertaining the degree of his danger and of circumventing the lady\\nif he found it material  This was agreed upon between the two friends\\nas the only thing to be done and Colonel Wallis was to assist\\nin every way that he could  He was to be introduced and Mrs Wallis\\nwas to be introduced and everybody was to be introduced\\nMr Elliot came back accordingly and on application was forgiven\\nas you know and readmitted into the family and there it was\\nhis constant object and his only object till your arrival\\nadded another motive to watch Sir Walter and Mrs Clay\\nHe omitted no opportunity of being with them threw himself in their way\\ncalled at all hours but I need not be particular on this subject\\nYou can imagine what an artful man would do and with this guide\\nperhaps may recollect what you have seen him do\\n\\nYes said Anne you tell me nothing which does not accord with\\nwhat I have known or could imagine  There is always something offensive\\nin the details of cunning  The manoeuvres of selfishness and duplicity\\nmust ever be revolting but I have heard nothing which really surprises me\\nI know those who would be shocked by such a representation of Mr Elliot\\nwho would have difficulty in believing it but I have never been satisfied\\nI have always wanted some other motive for his conduct than appeared\\nI should like to know his present opinion as to the probability\\nof the event he has been in dread of whether he considers the danger\\nto be lessening or not\\n\\nLessening I understand replied Mrs Smith  He thinks Mrs Clay\\nafraid of him aware that he sees through her and not daring to proceed\\nas she might do in his absence  But since he must be absent\\nsome time or other I do not perceive how he can ever be secure\\nwhile she holds her present influence  Mrs Wallis has an amusing idea\\nas nurse tells me that it is to be put into the marriage articles\\nwhen you and Mr Elliot marry that your father is not to marry Mrs Clay\\nA scheme worthy of Mrs Walliss understanding by all accounts\\nbut my sensible nurse Rooke sees the absurdity of it  Why to be sure\\nmaam said she it would not prevent his marrying anybody else\\nAnd indeed to own the truth I do not think nurse in her heart\\nis a very strenuous opposer of Sir Walters making a second match\\nShe must be allowed to be a favourer of matrimony you know\\nand since self will intrude who can say that she may not have\\nsome flying visions of attending the next Lady Elliot through\\nMrs Walliss recommendation\\n\\nI am very glad to know all this said Anne after a little\\nthoughtfulness  It will be more painful to me in some respects\\nto be in company with him but I shall know better what to do\\nMy line of conduct will be more direct  Mr Elliot is evidently\\na disingenuous artificial worldly man who has never had\\nany better principle to guide him than selfishness\\n\\nBut Mr Elliot was not done with  Mrs Smith had been carried away\\nfrom her first direction and Anne had forgotten in the interest\\nof her own family concerns how much had been originally implied\\nagainst him but her attention was now called to the explanation\\nof those first hints and she listened to a recital which\\nif it did not perfectly justify the unqualified bitterness of Mrs Smith\\nproved him to have been very unfeeling in his conduct towards her\\nvery deficient both in justice and compassion\\n\\nShe learned that the intimacy between them continuing unimpaired\\nby Mr Elliots marriage they had been as before always together\\nand Mr Elliot had led his friend into expenses much beyond his fortune\\nMrs Smith did not want to take blame to herself and was most tender\\nof throwing any on her husband but Anne could collect that their income\\nhad never been equal to their style of living and that from the first\\nthere had been a great deal of general and joint extravagance\\nFrom his wifes account of him she could discern Mr Smith to have been\\na man of warm feelings easy temper careless habits and not strong\\nunderstanding much more amiable than his friend and very unlike him\\nled by him and probably despised by him  Mr Elliot raised by\\nhis marriage to great affluence and disposed to every gratification\\nof pleasure and vanity which could be commanded without involving himself\\nfor with all his selfindulgence he had become a prudent man\\nand beginning to be rich just as his friend ought to have found himself\\nto be poor seemed to have had no concern at all for that friends\\nprobable finances but on the contrary had been prompting and\\nencouraging expenses which could end only in ruin and the Smiths\\naccordingly had been ruined\\n\\nThe husband had died just in time to be spared the full knowledge of it\\nThey had previously known embarrassments enough to try the friendship\\nof their friends and to prove that Mr Elliots had better not be tried\\nbut it was not till his death that the wretched state of his affairs\\nwas fully known  With a confidence in Mr Elliots regard\\nmore creditable to his feelings than his judgement Mr Smith had\\nappointed him the executor of his will but Mr Elliot would not act\\nand the difficulties and distress which this refusal had heaped on her\\nin addition to the inevitable sufferings of her situation had been such\\nas could not be related without anguish of spirit or listened to\\nwithout corresponding indignation\\n\\nAnne was shewn some letters of his on the occasion answers to\\nurgent applications from Mrs Smith which all breathed the same\\nstern resolution of not engaging in a fruitless trouble and\\nunder a cold civility the same hardhearted indifference\\nto any of the evils it might bring on her  It was a dreadful picture\\nof ingratitude and inhumanity and Anne felt at some moments\\nthat no flagrant open crime could have been worse  She had a great deal\\nto listen to all the particulars of past sad scenes all the minutiae\\nof distress upon distress which in former conversations had been\\nmerely hinted at were dwelt on now with a natural indulgence\\nAnne could perfectly comprehend the exquisite relief and was only\\nthe more inclined to wonder at the composure of her friends\\nusual state of mind\\n\\nThere was one circumstance in the history of her grievances\\nof particular irritation  She had good reason to believe that\\nsome property of her husband in the West Indies which had been\\nfor many years under a sort of sequestration for the payment\\nof its own incumbrances might be recoverable by proper measures\\nand this property though not large would be enough to make\\nher comparatively rich  But there was nobody to stir in it\\nMr Elliot would do nothing and she could do nothing herself\\nequally disabled from personal exertion by her state of\\nbodily weakness and from employing others by her want of money\\nShe had no natural connexions to assist her even with their counsel\\nand she could not afford to purchase the assistance of the law\\nThis was a cruel aggravation of actually straitened means\\nTo feel that she ought to be in better circumstances\\nthat a little trouble in the right place might do it\\nand to fear that delay might be even weakening her claims\\nwas hard to bear\\n\\nIt was on this point that she had hoped to engage Annes good offices\\nwith Mr Elliot  She had previously in the anticipation\\nof their marriage been very apprehensive of losing her friend by it\\nbut on being assured that he could have made no attempt of that nature\\nsince he did not even know her to be in Bath it immediately occurred\\nthat something might be done in her favour by the influence of the woman\\nhe loved and she had been hastily preparing to interest Annes feelings\\nas far as the observances due to Mr Elliots character would allow\\nwhen Annes refutation of the supposed engagement changed\\nthe face of everything and while it took from her the newformed hope\\nof succeeding in the object of her first anxiety left her at least\\nthe comfort of telling the whole story her own way\\n\\nAfter listening to this full description of Mr Elliot Anne could not but\\nexpress some surprise at Mrs Smiths having spoken of him so favourably\\nin the beginning of their conversation  She had seemed to recommend\\nand praise him\\n\\nMy dear was Mrs Smiths reply there was nothing else to be done\\nI considered your marrying him as certain though he might not yet\\nhave made the offer and I could no more speak the truth of him\\nthan if he had been your husband  My heart bled for you\\nas I talked of happiness and yet he is sensible he is agreeable\\nand with such a woman as you it was not absolutely hopeless\\nHe was very unkind to his first wife  They were wretched together\\nBut she was too ignorant and giddy for respect and he had never loved her\\nI was willing to hope that you must fare better\\n\\nAnne could just acknowledge within herself such a possibility\\nof having been induced to marry him as made her shudder at the idea\\nof the misery which must have followed  It was just possible that\\nshe might have been persuaded by Lady Russell  And under such\\na supposition which would have been most miserable when time had\\ndisclosed all too late\\n\\nIt was very desirable that Lady Russell should be no longer deceived\\nand one of the concluding arrangements of this important conference\\nwhich carried them through the greater part of the morning\\nwas that Anne had full liberty to communicate to her friend\\neverything relative to Mrs Smith in which his conduct was involved\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 22\\n\\n\\nAnne went home to think over all that she had heard  In one point\\nher feelings were relieved by this knowledge of Mr Elliot\\nThere was no longer anything of tenderness due to him  He stood as\\nopposed to Captain Wentworth in all his own unwelcome obtrusiveness\\nand the evil of his attentions last night the irremediable mischief\\nhe might have done was considered with sensations unqualified unperplexed\\nPity for him was all over  But this was the only point of relief\\nIn every other respect in looking around her or penetrating forward\\nshe saw more to distrust and to apprehend  She was concerned\\nfor the disappointment and pain Lady Russell would be feeling\\nfor the mortifications which must be hanging over her father and sister\\nand had all the distress of foreseeing many evils without knowing\\nhow to avert any one of them  She was most thankful for her own\\nknowledge of him  She had never considered herself as entitled to reward\\nfor not slighting an old friend like Mrs Smith but here was\\na reward indeed springing from it  Mrs Smith had been able to tell her\\nwhat no one else could have done  Could the knowledge have\\nbeen extended through her family  But this was a vain idea\\nShe must talk to Lady Russell tell her consult with her\\nand having done her best wait the event with as much composure\\nas possible and after all her greatest want of composure would be\\nin that quarter of the mind which could not be opened to Lady Russell\\nin that flow of anxieties and fears which must be all to herself\\n\\n\\nShe found on reaching home that she had as she intended\\nescaped seeing Mr Elliot that he had called and paid them\\na long morning visit but hardly had she congratulated herself\\nand felt safe when she heard that he was coming again in the evening\\n\\nI had not the smallest intention of asking him said Elizabeth\\nwith affected carelessness but he gave so many hints\\nso Mrs Clay says at least\\n\\nIndeed I do say it  I never saw anybody in my life spell harder\\nfor an invitation  Poor man  I was really in pain for him\\nfor your hardhearted sister Miss Anne seems bent on cruelty\\n\\nOh cried Elizabeth I have been rather too much used to the game\\nto be soon overcome by a gentlemans hints  However when I found\\nhow excessively he was regretting that he should miss my father\\nthis morning I gave way immediately for I would never really omit\\nan opportunity of bring him and Sir Walter together  They appear to\\nso much advantage in company with each other  Each behaving so pleasantly\\nMr Elliot looking up with so much respect\\n\\nQuite delightful cried Mrs Clay not daring however\\nto turn her eyes towards Anne  Exactly like father and son\\nDear Miss Elliot may I not say father and son\\n\\nOh I lay no embargo on any bodys words  If you will have such\\nideas  But upon my word I am scarcely sensible of his attentions\\nbeing beyond those of other men\\n\\nMy dear Miss Elliot exclaimed Mrs Clay lifting her hands and eyes\\nand sinking all the rest of her astonishment in a convenient silence\\n\\nWell my dear Penelope you need not be so alarmed about him\\nI did invite him you know  I sent him away with smiles\\nWhen I found he was really going to his friends at Thornberry Park\\nfor the whole day tomorrow I had compassion on him\\n\\nAnne admired the good acting of the friend in being able to shew\\nsuch pleasure as she did in the expectation and in the actual arrival\\nof the very person whose presence must really be interfering with\\nher prime object  It was impossible but that Mrs Clay must hate\\nthe sight of Mr Elliot and yet she could assume a most obliging\\nplacid look and appear quite satisfied with the curtailed license\\nof devoting herself only half as much to Sir Walter as she would have\\ndone otherwise\\n\\nTo Anne herself it was most distressing to see Mr Elliot enter the room\\nand quite painful to have him approach and speak to her\\nShe had been used before to feel that he could not be always quite sincere\\nbut now she saw insincerity in everything  His attentive deference\\nto her father contrasted with his former language was odious\\nand when she thought of his cruel conduct towards Mrs Smith\\nshe could hardly bear the sight of his present smiles and mildness\\nor the sound of his artificial good sentiments\\n\\nShe meant to avoid any such alteration of manners as might provoke\\na remonstrance on his side  It was a great object to her to escape\\nall enquiry or eclat but it was her intention to be as decidedly cool\\nto him as might be compatible with their relationship and to retrace\\nas quietly as she could the few steps of unnecessary intimacy she had\\nbeen gradually led along  She was accordingly more guarded\\nand more cool than she had been the night before\\n\\nHe wanted to animate her curiosity again as to how and where\\nhe could have heard her formerly praised wanted very much\\nto be gratified by more solicitation but the charm was broken\\nhe found that the heat and animation of a public room was necessary\\nto kindle his modest cousins vanity he found at least that it was\\nnot to be done now by any of those attempts which he could hazard\\namong the toocommanding claims of the others  He little surmised\\nthat it was a subject acting now exactly against his interest\\nbringing immediately to her thoughts all those parts of his conduct\\nwhich were least excusable\\n\\nShe had some satisfaction in finding that he was really going out of Bath\\nthe next morning going early and that he would be gone the greater part\\nof two days  He was invited again to Camden Place the very evening of\\nhis return but from Thursday to Saturday evening his absence was certain\\nIt was bad enough that a Mrs Clay should be always before her\\nbut that a deeper hypocrite should be added to their party\\nseemed the destruction of everything like peace and comfort\\nIt was so humiliating to reflect on the constant deception practised\\non her father and Elizabeth to consider the various sources\\nof mortification preparing for them  Mrs Clays selfishness was\\nnot so complicate nor so revolting as his and Anne would have compounded\\nfor the marriage at once with all its evils to be clear of Mr Elliots\\nsubtleties in endeavouring to prevent it\\n\\nOn Friday morning she meant to go very early to Lady Russell\\nand accomplish the necessary communication and she would have gone\\ndirectly after breakfast but that Mrs Clay was also going out\\non some obliging purpose of saving her sister trouble which\\ndetermined her to wait till she might be safe from such a companion\\nShe saw Mrs Clay fairly off therefore before she began to talk\\nof spending the morning in Rivers Street\\n\\nVery well said Elizabeth I have nothing to send but my love\\nOh you may as well take back that tiresome book she would lend me\\nand pretend I have read it through  I really cannot be plaguing myself\\nfor ever with all the new poems and states of the nation that come out\\nLady Russell quite bores one with her new publications\\nYou need not tell her so but I thought her dress hideous the other night\\nI used to think she had some taste in dress but I was ashamed of her\\nat the concert  Something so formal and arrange in her air\\nand she sits so upright  My best love of course\\n\\nAnd mine added Sir Walter  Kindest regards  And you may say\\nthat I mean to call upon her soon  Make a civil message\\nbut I shall only leave my card  Morning visits are never fair\\nby women at her time of life who make themselves up so little\\nIf she would only wear rouge she would not be afraid of being seen\\nbut last time I called I observed the blinds were let down immediately\\n\\nWhile her father spoke there was a knock at the door  Who could it be\\nAnne remembering the preconcerted visits at all hours of Mr Elliot\\nwould have expected him but for his known engagement seven miles off\\nAfter the usual period of suspense the usual sounds of approach were heard\\nand Mr and Mrs Charles Musgrove were ushered into the room\\n\\nSurprise was the strongest emotion raised by their appearance\\nbut Anne was really glad to see them and the others were not so sorry\\nbut that they could put on a decent air of welcome and as soon\\nas it became clear that these their nearest relations were not arrived\\nwith an views of accommodation in that house Sir Walter and Elizabeth\\nwere able to rise in cordiality and do the honours of it very well\\nThey were come to Bath for a few days with Mrs Musgrove and were\\nat the White Hart  So much was pretty soon understood\\nbut till Sir Walter and Elizabeth were walking Mary into\\nthe other drawingroom and regaling themselves with her admiration\\nAnne could not draw upon Charless brain for a regular history\\nof their coming or an explanation of some smiling hints\\nof particular business which had been ostentatiously dropped by Mary\\nas well as of some apparent confusion as to whom their party consisted of\\n\\nShe then found that it consisted of Mrs Musgrove Henrietta\\nand Captain Harville beside their two selves  He gave her a very plain\\nintelligible account of the whole a narration in which she saw\\na great deal of most characteristic proceeding  The scheme\\nhad received its first impulse by Captain Harvilles wanting to\\ncome to Bath on business  He had begun to talk of it a week ago\\nand by way of doing something as shooting was over Charles had proposed\\ncoming with him and Mrs Harville had seemed to like the idea of it\\nvery much as an advantage to her husband but Mary could not bear\\nto be left and had made herself so unhappy about it that for a day or two\\neverything seemed to be in suspense or at an end  But then\\nit had been taken up by his father and mother  His mother had\\nsome old friends in Bath whom she wanted to see it was thought\\na good opportunity for Henrietta to come and buy weddingclothes\\nfor herself and her sister and in short it ended in being\\nhis mothers party that everything might be comfortable and easy\\nto Captain Harville and he and Mary were included in it\\nby way of general convenience  They had arrived late the night before\\nMrs Harville her children and Captain Benwick remained with\\nMr Musgrove and Louisa at Uppercross\\n\\nAnnes only surprise was that affairs should be in forwardness enough\\nfor Henriettas weddingclothes to be talked of  She had imagined\\nsuch difficulties of fortune to exist there as must prevent\\nthe marriage from being near at hand but she learned from Charles that\\nvery recently since Marys last letter to herself Charles Hayter\\nhad been applied to by a friend to hold a living for a youth\\nwho could not possibly claim it under many years and that\\non the strength of his present income with almost a certainty\\nof something more permanent long before the term in question\\nthe two families had consented to the young peoples wishes\\nand that their marriage was likely to take place in a few months\\nquite as soon as Louisas  And a very good living it was\\nCharles added  only fiveandtwenty miles from Uppercross\\nand in a very fine country   fine part of Dorsetshire\\nIn the centre of some of the best preserves in the kingdom\\nsurrounded by three great proprietors each more careful and jealous\\nthan the other and to two of the three at least Charles Hayter might get\\na special recommendation  Not that he will value it as he ought\\nhe observed Charles is too cool about sporting Thats the worst of him\\n\\nI am extremely glad indeed cried Anne particularly glad\\nthat this should happen and that of two sisters who both deserve\\nequally well and who have always been such good friends\\nthe pleasant prospect of one should not be dimming those of the other\\nthat they should be so equal in their prosperity and comfort\\nI hope your father and mother are quite happy with regard to both\\n\\nOh yes  My father would be well pleased if the gentlemen were richer\\nbut he has no other fault to find  Money you know coming down with\\nmoneytwo daughters at onceit cannot be a very agreeable operation\\nand it streightens him as to many things  However I do not mean to say\\nthey have not a right to it  It is very fit they should have\\ndaughters shares and I am sure he has always been a very kind\\nliberal father to me  Mary does not above half like Henriettas match\\nShe never did you know  But she does not do him justice\\nnor think enough about Winthrop  I cannot make her attend to\\nthe value of the property  It is a very fair match as times go\\nand I have liked Charles Hayter all my life and I shall not leave off now\\n\\nSuch excellent parents as Mr and Mrs Musgrove exclaimed Anne\\nshould be happy in their childrens marriages  They do everything\\nto confer happiness I am sure  What a blessing to young people\\nto be in such hands  Your father and mother seem so totally free\\nfrom all those ambitious feelings which have led to so much misconduct\\nand misery both in young and old  I hope you think Louisa\\nperfectly recovered now\\n\\nHe answered rather hesitatingly Yes I believe I do very much recovered\\nbut she is altered there is no running or jumping about no laughing\\nor dancing it is quite different  If one happens only to shut the door\\na little hard she starts and wriggles like a young dabchick in the water\\nand Benwick sits at her elbow reading verses or whispering to her\\nall day long\\n\\nAnne could not help laughing  That cannot be much to your taste\\nI know said she but I do believe him to be an excellent young man\\n\\nTo be sure he is  Nobody doubts it and I hope you do not think\\nI am so illiberal as to want every man to have the same objects and\\npleasures as myself  I have a great value for Benwick and when one can\\nbut get him to talk he has plenty to say  His reading has done him\\nno harm for he has fought as well as read  He is a brave fellow\\nI got more acquainted with him last Monday than ever I did before\\nWe had a famous setto at rathunting all the morning in\\nmy fathers great barns and he played his part so well\\nthat I have liked him the better ever since\\n\\nHere they were interrupted by the absolute necessity of Charless\\nfollowing the others to admire mirrors and china but Anne had\\nheard enough to understand the present state of Uppercross\\nand rejoice in its happiness and though she sighed as she rejoiced\\nher sigh had none of the illwill of envy in it  She would certainly\\nhave risen to their blessings if she could but she did not want\\nto lessen theirs\\n\\nThe visit passed off altogether in high good humour  Mary was\\nin excellent spirits enjoying the gaiety and the change\\nand so well satisfied with the journey in her motherinlaws carriage\\nwith four horses and with her own complete independence of Camden Place\\nthat she was exactly in a temper to admire everything as she ought\\nand enter most readily into all the superiorities of the house\\nas they were detailed to her  She had no demands on her father or sister\\nand her consequence was just enough increased by their handsome\\ndrawingrooms\\n\\nElizabeth was for a short time suffering a good deal\\nShe felt that Mrs Musgrove and all her party ought to be asked\\nto dine with them but she could not bear to have the difference of style\\nthe reduction of servants which a dinner must betray witnessed by those\\nwho had been always so inferior to the Elliots of Kellynch\\nIt was a struggle between propriety and vanity but vanity got the better\\nand then Elizabeth was happy again  These were her internal persuasions\\nOld fashioned notions country hospitality we do not profess\\nto give dinners few people in Bath do Lady Alicia never does\\ndid not even ask her own sisters family though they were here a month\\nand I dare say it would be very inconvenient to Mrs Musgrove\\nput her quite out of her way  I am sure she would rather not come\\nshe cannot feel easy with us  I will ask them all for an evening\\nthat will be much better that will be a novelty and a treat\\nThey have not seen two such drawing rooms before  They will be delighted\\nto come tomorrow evening  It shall be a regular party small\\nbut most elegant  And this satisfied Elizabeth  and when the invitation\\nwas given to the two present and promised for the absent\\nMary was as completely satisfied  She was particularly asked\\nto meet Mr Elliot and be introduced to Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret\\nwho were fortunately already engaged to come and she could not\\nhave received a more gratifying attention  Miss Elliot was to have\\nthe honour of calling on Mrs Musgrove in the course of the morning\\nand Anne walked off with Charles and Mary to go and see her\\nand Henrietta directly\\n\\nHer plan of sitting with Lady Russell must give way for the present\\nThey all three called in Rivers Street for a couple of minutes\\nbut Anne convinced herself that a days delay of the intended communication\\ncould be of no consequence and hastened forward to the White Hart\\nto see again the friends and companions of the last autumn\\nwith an eagerness of goodwill which many associations contributed to form\\n\\nThey found Mrs Musgrove and her daughter within and by themselves\\nand Anne had the kindest welcome from each  Henrietta was exactly\\nin that state of recentlyimproved views of freshformed happiness\\nwhich made her full of regard and interest for everybody she had\\never liked before at all and Mrs Musgroves real affection had been won\\nby her usefulness when they were in distress  It was a heartiness\\nand a warmth and a sincerity which Anne delighted in the more\\nfrom the sad want of such blessings at home  She was entreated\\nto give them as much of her time as possible invited for every day\\nand all day long or rather claimed as part of the family and in return\\nshe naturally fell into all her wonted ways of attention and assistance\\nand on Charless leaving them together was listening to Mrs Musgroves\\nhistory of Louisa and to Henriettas of herself giving opinions\\non business and recommendations to shops with intervals of every help\\nwhich Mary required from altering her ribbon to settling her accounts\\nfrom finding her keys and assorting her trinkets to trying\\nto convince her that she was not illused by anybody which Mary\\nwell amused as she generally was in her station at a window\\noverlooking the entrance to the Pump Room could not but have\\nher moments of imagining\\n\\nA morning of thorough confusion was to be expected  A large party\\nin an hotel ensured a quickchanging unsettled scene  One five minutes\\nbrought a note the next a parcel and Anne had not been there\\nhalf an hour when their diningroom spacious as it was\\nseemed more than half filled  a party of steady old friends\\nwere seated around Mrs Musgrove and Charles came back with\\nCaptains Harville and Wentworth  The appearance of the latter\\ncould not be more than the surprise of the moment  It was impossible\\nfor her to have forgotten to feel that this arrival of their\\ncommon friends must be soon bringing them together again\\nTheir last meeting had been most important in opening his feelings\\nshe had derived from it a delightful conviction but she feared\\nfrom his looks that the same unfortunate persuasion which had\\nhastened him away from the Concert Room still governed\\nHe did not seem to want to be near enough for conversation\\n\\nShe tried to be calm and leave things to take their course\\nand tried to dwell much on this argument of rational dependence\\nSurely if there be constant attachment on each side our hearts\\nmust understand each other ere long  We are not boy and girl\\nto be captiously irritable misled by every moments inadvertence\\nand wantonly playing with our own happiness  And yet\\na few minutes afterwards she felt as if their being in company\\nwith each other under their present circumstances could only be\\nexposing them to inadvertencies and misconstructions of the most\\nmischievous kind\\n\\nAnne cried Mary still at her window there is Mrs Clay\\nI am sure standing under the colonnade and a gentleman with her\\nI saw them turn the corner from Bath Street just now  They seemed\\ndeep in talk  Who is it  Come and tell me  Good heavens I recollect\\nIt is Mr Elliot himself\\n\\nNo cried Anne quickly it cannot be Mr Elliot I assure you\\nHe was to leave Bath at nine this morning and does not come back\\ntill tomorrow\\n\\nAs she spoke she felt that Captain Wentworth was looking at her\\nthe consciousness of which vexed and embarrassed her and made her regret\\nthat she had said so much simple as it was\\n\\nMary resenting that she should be supposed not to know her own cousin\\nbegan talking very warmly about the family features and protesting\\nstill more positively that it was Mr Elliot calling again upon Anne\\nto come and look for herself but Anne did not mean to stir\\nand tried to be cool and unconcerned  Her distress returned\\nhowever on perceiving smiles and intelligent glances pass between\\ntwo or three of the lady visitors as if they believed themselves\\nquite in the secret  It was evident that the report concerning her\\nhad spread and a short pause succeeded which seemed to ensure\\nthat it would now spread farther\\n\\nDo come Anne cried Mary come and look yourself  You will be too late\\nif you do not make haste  They are parting they are shaking hands\\nHe is turning away  Not know Mr Elliot indeed  You seem to have\\nforgot all about Lyme\\n\\nTo pacify Mary and perhaps screen her own embarrassment\\nAnne did move quietly to the window  She was just in time to ascertain\\nthat it really was Mr Elliot which she had never believed\\nbefore he disappeared on one side as Mrs Clay walked quickly off\\non the other and checking the surprise which she could not but feel\\nat such an appearance of friendly conference between two persons\\nof totally opposite interest she calmly said Yes it is Mr Elliot\\ncertainly  He has changed his hour of going I suppose that is all\\nor I may be mistaken I might not attend and walked back to her chair\\nrecomposed and with the comfortable hope of having acquitted herself well\\n\\nThe visitors took their leave and Charles having civilly seen them off\\nand then made a face at them and abused them for coming began with\\n\\nWell mother I have done something for you that you will like\\nI have been to the theatre and secured a box for tomorrow night\\nAnt I a good boy  I know you love a play and there is room for us all\\nIt holds nine  I have engaged Captain Wentworth  Anne will\\nnot be sorry to join us I am sure  We all like a play\\nHave not I done well mother\\n\\nMrs Musgrove was good humouredly beginning to express her perfect readiness\\nfor the play if Henrietta and all the others liked it when Mary\\neagerly interrupted her by exclaiming\\n\\nGood heavens Charles how can you think of such a thing\\nTake a box for tomorrow night  Have you forgot that we are engaged\\nto Camden Place tomorrow night and that we were most particularly asked\\nto meet Lady Dalrymple and her daughter and Mr Elliot and all\\nthe principal family connexions on purpose to be introduced to them\\nHow can you be so forgetful\\n\\nPhoo phoo replied Charles whats an evening party\\nNever worth remembering  Your father might have asked us to dinner\\nI think if he had wanted to see us  You may do as you like\\nbut I shall go to the play\\n\\nOh Charles I declare it will be too abominable if you do\\nwhen you promised to go\\n\\nNo I did not promise  I only smirked and bowed and said the word\\nhappy  There was no promise\\n\\nBut you must go Charles  It would be unpardonable to fail\\nWe were asked on purpose to be introduced  There was always\\nsuch a great connexion between the Dalrymples and ourselves\\nNothing ever happened on either side that was not announced immediately\\nWe are quite near relations you know and Mr Elliot too\\nwhom you ought so particularly to be acquainted with  Every attention\\nis due to Mr Elliot  Consider my fathers heir  the future\\nrepresentative of the family\\n\\nDont talk to me about heirs and representatives cried Charles\\nI am not one of those who neglect the reigning power to bow\\nto the rising sun  If I would not go for the sake of your father\\nI should think it scandalous to go for the sake of his heir\\nWhat is Mr Elliot to me  The careless expression was life to Anne\\nwho saw that Captain Wentworth was all attention looking and\\nlistening with his whole soul and that the last words brought\\nhis enquiring eyes from Charles to herself\\n\\nCharles and Mary still talked on in the same style he half serious\\nand half jesting maintaining the scheme for the play and she\\ninvariably serious most warmly opposing it and not omitting\\nto make it known that however determined to go to Camden Place herself\\nshe should not think herself very well used if they went to the play\\nwithout her  Mrs Musgrove interposed\\n\\nWe had better put it off  Charles you had much better go back\\nand change the box for Tuesday  It would be a pity to be divided\\nand we should be losing Miss Anne too if there is a party at her fathers\\nand I am sure neither Henrietta nor I should care at all for the play\\nif Miss Anne could not be with us\\n\\nAnne felt truly obliged to her for such kindness and quite as much\\nso for the opportunity it gave her of decidedly saying\\n\\nIf it depended only on my inclination maam the party at home\\nexcepting on Marys account would not be the smallest impediment\\nI have no pleasure in the sort of meeting and should be too happy\\nto change it for a play and with you  But it had better\\nnot be attempted perhaps  She had spoken it but she trembled\\nwhen it was done conscious that her words were listened to\\nand daring not even to try to observe their effect\\n\\nIt was soon generally agreed that Tuesday should be the day\\nCharles only reserving the advantage of still teasing his wife\\nby persisting that he would go to the play tomorrow if nobody else would\\n\\nCaptain Wentworth left his seat and walked to the fireplace\\nprobably for the sake of walking away from it soon afterwards\\nand taking a station with less barefaced design by Anne\\n\\nYou have not been long enough in Bath said he to enjoy\\nthe evening parties of the place\\n\\nOh no  The usual character of them has nothing for me\\nI am no cardplayer\\n\\nYou were not formerly I know  You did not use to like cards\\nbut time makes many changes\\n\\nI am not yet so much changed cried Anne and stopped fearing she\\nhardly knew what misconstruction  After waiting a few moments\\nhe said and as if it were the result of immediate feeling\\nIt is a period indeed  Eight years and a half is a period\\n\\nWhether he would have proceeded farther was left to Annes imagination\\nto ponder over in a calmer hour for while still hearing the sounds\\nhe had uttered she was startled to other subjects by Henrietta\\neager to make use of the present leisure for getting out\\nand calling on her companions to lose no time lest somebody else\\nshould come in\\n\\nThey were obliged to move  Anne talked of being perfectly ready\\nand tried to look it but she felt that could Henrietta have known\\nthe regret and reluctance of her heart in quitting that chair\\nin preparing to quit the room she would have found in all her own\\nsensations for her cousin in the very security of his affection\\nwherewith to pity her\\n\\nTheir preparations however were stopped short  Alarming sounds\\nwere heard other visitors approached and the door was thrown open\\nfor Sir Walter and Miss Elliot whose entrance seemed to give\\na general chill  Anne felt an instant oppression and wherever she looked\\nsaw symptoms of the same  The comfort the freedom the gaiety\\nof the room was over hushed into cold composure determined silence\\nor insipid talk to meet the heartless elegance of her father and sister\\nHow mortifying to feel that it was so\\n\\nHer jealous eye was satisfied in one particular  Captain Wentworth\\nwas acknowledged again by each by Elizabeth more graciously than before\\nShe even addressed him once and looked at him more than once\\nElizabeth was in fact revolving a great measure  The sequel\\nexplained it  After the waste of a few minutes in saying\\nthe proper nothings she began to give the invitation which\\nwas to comprise all the remaining dues of the Musgroves\\nTomorrow evening to meet a few friends  no formal party\\nIt was all said very gracefully and the cards with which she had\\nprovided herself the Miss Elliot at home were laid on the table\\nwith a courteous comprehensive smile to all and one smile and\\none card more decidedly for Captain Wentworth  The truth was\\nthat Elizabeth had been long enough in Bath to understand\\nthe importance of a man of such an air and appearance as his\\nThe past was nothing  The present was that Captain Wentworth\\nwould move about well in her drawingroom  The card was pointedly given\\nand Sir Walter and Elizabeth arose and disappeared\\n\\nThe interruption had been short though severe and ease and animation\\nreturned to most of those they left as the door shut them out\\nbut not to Anne  She could think only of the invitation she had\\nwith such astonishment witnessed and of the manner in which\\nit had been received a manner of doubtful meaning of surprise rather\\nthan gratification of polite acknowledgement rather than acceptance\\nShe knew him she saw disdain in his eye and could not venture to believe\\nthat he had determined to accept such an offering as an atonement\\nfor all the insolence of the past  Her spirits sank  He held the card\\nin his hand after they were gone as if deeply considering it\\n\\nOnly think of Elizabeths including everybody whispered Mary\\nvery audibly  I do not wonder Captain Wentworth is delighted\\nYou see he cannot put the card out of his hand\\n\\nAnne caught his eye saw his cheeks glow and his mouth form itself\\ninto a momentary expression of contempt and turned away\\nthat she might neither see nor hear more to vex her\\n\\nThe party separated  The gentlemen had their own pursuits\\nthe ladies proceeded on their own business and they met no more while\\nAnne belonged to them  She was earnestly begged to return and dine\\nand give them all the rest of the day but her spirits had been\\nso long exerted that at present she felt unequal to more\\nand fit only for home where she might be sure of being as silent\\nas she chose\\n\\nPromising to be with them the whole of the following morning therefore\\nshe closed the fatigues of the present by a toilsome walk to Camden Place\\nthere to spend the evening chiefly in listening to the busy arrangements\\nof Elizabeth and Mrs Clay for the morrows party the frequent enumeration\\nof the persons invited and the continually improving detail of all\\nthe embellishments which were to make it the most completely elegant\\nof its kind in Bath while harassing herself with the neverending\\nquestion of whether Captain Wentworth would come or not  They were\\nreckoning him as certain but with her it was a gnawing solicitude\\nnever appeased for five minutes together  She generally thought\\nhe would come because she generally thought he ought but it was a case\\nwhich she could not so shape into any positive act of duty or discretion\\nas inevitably to defy the suggestions of very opposite feelings\\n\\nShe only roused herself from the broodings of this restless agitation\\nto let Mrs Clay know that she had been seen with Mr Elliot\\nthree hours after his being supposed to be out of Bath\\nfor having watched in vain for some intimation of the interview\\nfrom the lady herself she determined to mention it and it seemed to her\\nthere was guilt in Mrs Clays face as she listened  It was transient\\ncleared away in an instant but Anne could imagine she read there\\nthe consciousness of having by some complication of mutual trick\\nor some overbearing authority of his been obliged to attend\\nperhaps for half an hour to his lectures and restrictions on her designs\\non Sir Walter  She exclaimed however with a very tolerable\\nimitation of nature \\n\\nOh dear very true  Only think Miss Elliot to my great surprise\\nI met with Mr Elliot in Bath Street  I was never more astonished\\nHe turned back and walked with me to the Pump Yard  He had been prevented\\nsetting off for Thornberry but I really forget by what\\nfor I was in a hurry and could not much attend and I can only answer\\nfor his being determined not to be delayed in his return\\nHe wanted to know how early he might be admitted tomorrow\\nHe was full of tomorrow and it is very evident that I have been\\nfull of it too ever since I entered the house and learnt the extension\\nof your plan and all that had happened or my seeing him could never have\\ngone so entirely out of my head\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 23\\n\\n\\nOne day only had passed since Annes conversation with Mrs Smith\\nbut a keener interest had succeeded and she was now so little touched\\nby Mr Elliots conduct except by its effects in one quarter\\nthat it became a matter of course the next morning still to defer\\nher explanatory visit in Rivers Street  She had promised to be\\nwith the Musgroves from breakfast to dinner  Her faith was plighted\\nand Mr Elliots character like the Sultaness Scheherazades head\\nmust live another day\\n\\nShe could not keep her appointment punctually however\\nthe weather was unfavourable and she had grieved over the rain\\non her friends account and felt it very much on her own\\nbefore she was able to attempt the walk  When she reached the White Hart\\nand made her way to the proper apartment she found herself\\nneither arriving quite in time nor the first to arrive\\nThe party before her were Mrs Musgrove talking to Mrs Croft\\nand Captain Harville to Captain Wentworth and she immediately heard\\nthat Mary and Henrietta too impatient to wait had gone out the moment\\nit had cleared but would be back again soon and that the strictest\\ninjunctions had been left with Mrs Musgrove to keep her there\\ntill they returned  She had only to submit sit down\\nbe outwardly composed and feel herself plunged at once\\nin all the agitations which she had merely laid her account of\\ntasting a little before the morning closed  There was no delay\\nno waste of time  She was deep in the happiness of such misery\\nor the misery of such happiness instantly  Two minutes after\\nher entering the room Captain Wentworth said\\n\\nWe will write the letter we were talking of Harville now\\nif you will give me materials\\n\\nMaterials were at hand on a separate table he went to it\\nand nearly turning his back to them all was engrossed by writing\\n\\nMrs Musgrove was giving Mrs Croft the history of her eldest\\ndaughters engagement and just in that inconvenient tone of voice\\nwhich was perfectly audible while it pretended to be a whisper\\nAnne felt that she did not belong to the conversation and yet\\nas Captain Harville seemed thoughtful and not disposed to talk\\nshe could not avoid hearing many undesirable particulars such as\\nhow Mr Musgrove and my brother Hayter had met again and again\\nto talk it over what my brother Hayter had said one day\\nand what Mr Musgrove had proposed the next and what had occurred\\nto my sister Hayter and what the young people had wished and what\\nI said at first I never could consent to but was afterwards persuaded\\nto think might do very well and a great deal in the same style\\nof openhearted communication  minutiae which even with every advantage\\nof taste and delicacy which good Mrs Musgrove could not give\\ncould be properly interesting only to the principals  Mrs Croft\\nwas attending with great goodhumour and whenever she spoke at all\\nit was very sensibly  Anne hoped the gentlemen might each be\\ntoo much selfoccupied to hear\\n\\nAnd so maam all these thing considered said Mrs Musgrove\\nin her powerful whisper though we could have wished it different\\nyet altogether we did not think it fair to stand out any longer\\nfor Charles Hayter was quite wild about it and Henrietta was\\npretty near as bad and so we thought they had better marry at once\\nand make the best of it as many others have done before them\\nAt any rate said I it will be better than a long engagement\\n\\nThat is precisely what I was going to observe cried Mrs Croft\\nI would rather have young people settle on a small income at once\\nand have to struggle with a few difficulties together than be\\ninvolved in a long engagement  I always think that no mutual\\n\\nOh dear Mrs Croft cried Mrs Musgrove unable to let her\\nfinish her speech there is nothing I so abominate for young people\\nas a long engagement  It is what I always protested against\\nfor my children  It is all very well I used to say for young people\\nto be engaged if there is a certainty of their being able to marry\\nin six months or even in twelve but a long engagement\\n\\nYes dear maam said Mrs Croft or an uncertain engagement\\nan engagement which may be long  To begin without knowing\\nthat at such a time there will be the means of marrying\\nI hold to be very unsafe and unwise and what I think all parents\\nshould prevent as far as they can\\n\\nAnne found an unexpected interest here  She felt its application\\nto herself felt it in a nervous thrill all over her and at the same\\nmoment that her eyes instinctively glanced towards the distant table\\nCaptain Wentworths pen ceased to move his head was raised pausing\\nlistening and he turned round the next instant to give a look\\none quick conscious look at her\\n\\nThe two ladies continued to talk to reurge the same admitted truths\\nand enforce them with such examples of the ill effect of\\na contrary practice as had fallen within their observation\\nbut Anne heard nothing distinctly it was only a buzz of words in her ear\\nher mind was in confusion\\n\\nCaptain Harville who had in truth been hearing none of it\\nnow left his seat and moved to a window and Anne seeming to watch him\\nthough it was from thorough absence of mind became gradually sensible\\nthat he was inviting her to join him where he stood  He looked at her\\nwith a smile and a little motion of the head which expressed\\nCome to me I have something to say and the unaffected\\neasy kindness of manner which denoted the feelings of an older acquaintance\\nthan he really was strongly enforced the invitation  She roused herself\\nand went to him  The window at which he stood was at the other end\\nof the room from where the two ladies were sitting and though nearer\\nto Captain Wentworths table not very near  As she joined him\\nCaptain Harvilles countenance reassumed the serious thoughtful\\nexpression which seemed its natural character\\n\\nLook here said he unfolding a parcel in his hand and displaying\\na small miniature painting do you know who that is\\n\\nCertainly  Captain Benwick\\n\\nYes and you may guess who it is for  But in a deep tone\\nit was not done for her  Miss Elliot do you remember our\\nwalking together at Lyme and grieving for him  I little thought then\\nbut no matter  This was drawn at the Cape  He met with\\na clever young German artist at the Cape and in compliance with a promise\\nto my poor sister sat to him and was bringing it home for her\\nand I have now the charge of getting it properly set for another\\nIt was a commission to me  But who else was there to employ\\nI hope I can allow for him  I am not sorry indeed to make it\\nover to another  He undertakes it looking towards Captain Wentworth\\nhe is writing about it now  And with a quivering lip he wound up\\nthe whole by adding Poor Fanny she would not have forgotten him so soon\\n\\nNo replied Anne in a low feeling voice That I can easily believe\\n\\nIt was not in her nature  She doted on him\\n\\nIt would not be the nature of any woman who truly loved\\n\\nCaptain Harville smiled as much as to say Do you claim that\\nfor your sex and she answered the question smiling also\\nYes  We certainly do not forget you as soon as you forget us\\nIt is perhaps our fate rather than our merit  We cannot help ourselves\\nWe live at home quiet confined and our feelings prey upon us\\nYou are forced on exertion  You have always a profession pursuits\\nbusiness of some sort or other to take you back into the world immediately\\nand continual occupation and change soon weaken impressions\\n\\nGranting your assertion that the world does all this so soon for men\\nwhich however I do not think I shall grant it does not apply\\nto Benwick  He has not been forced upon any exertion  The peace\\nturned him on shore at the very moment and he has been living with us\\nin our little family circle ever since\\n\\nTrue said Anne very true I did not recollect but what shall\\nwe say now Captain Harville  If the change be not from\\noutward circumstances it must be from within it must be nature\\nmans nature which has done the business for Captain Benwick\\n\\nNo no it is not mans nature  I will not allow it to be more\\nmans nature than womans to be inconstant and forget those they do love\\nor have loved  I believe the reverse  I believe in a true analogy\\nbetween our bodily frames and our mental and that as our bodies are\\nthe strongest so are our feelings capable of bearing most rough usage\\nand riding out the heaviest weather\\n\\nYour feelings may be the strongest replied Anne but the same spirit\\nof analogy will authorise me to assert that ours are the most tender\\nMan is more robust than woman but he is not longer lived\\nwhich exactly explains my view of the nature of their attachments\\nNay it would be too hard upon you if it were otherwise\\nYou have difficulties and privations and dangers enough to struggle with\\nYou are always labouring and toiling exposed to every risk and hardship\\nYour home country friends all quitted  Neither time nor health\\nnor life to be called your own  It would be hard indeed\\nwith a faltering voice if womans feelings were to be\\nadded to all this\\n\\nWe shall never agree upon this question Captain Harville\\nwas beginning to say when a slight noise called their attention\\nto Captain Wentworths hitherto perfectly quiet division of the room\\nIt was nothing more than that his pen had fallen down but Anne was\\nstartled at finding him nearer than she had supposed and half inclined\\nto suspect that the pen had only fallen because he had been\\noccupied by them striving to catch sounds which yet she did not think\\nhe could have caught\\n\\nHave you finished your letter said Captain Harville\\n\\nNot quite a few lines more  I shall have done in five minutes\\n\\nThere is no hurry on my side  I am only ready whenever you are\\nI am in very good anchorage here smiling at Anne well supplied\\nand want for nothing  No hurry for a signal at all  Well Miss Elliot\\nlowering his voice as I was saying we shall never agree\\nI suppose upon this point  No man and woman would probably\\nBut let me observe that all histories are against youall stories\\nprose and verse  If I had such a memory as Benwick I could bring you\\nfifty quotations in a moment on my side the argument and I do not think\\nI ever opened a book in my life which had not something to say\\nupon womans inconstancy  Songs and proverbs all talk\\nof womans fickleness  But perhaps you will say these were all\\nwritten by men\\n\\nPerhaps I shall  Yes yes if you please no reference to examples\\nin books  Men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story\\nEducation has been theirs in so much higher a degree the pen has\\nbeen in their hands  I will not allow books to prove anything\\n\\nBut how shall we prove anything\\n\\nWe never shall  We never can expect to prove any thing upon such a point\\nIt is a difference of opinion which does not admit of proof\\nWe each begin probably with a little bias towards our own sex\\nand upon that bias build every circumstance in favour of it\\nwhich has occurred within our own circle many of which circumstances\\nperhaps those very cases which strike us the most may be precisely such\\nas cannot be brought forward without betraying a confidence\\nor in some respect saying what should not be said\\n\\nAh cried Captain Harville in a tone of strong feeling\\nif I could but make you comprehend what a man suffers when he takes\\na last look at his wife and children and watches the boat\\nthat he has sent them off in as long as it is in sight\\nand then turns away and says God knows whether we ever meet again\\nAnd then if I could convey to you the glow of his soul when he does\\nsee them again when coming back after a twelvemonths absence\\nperhaps and obliged to put into another port he calculates how soon\\nit be possible to get them there pretending to deceive himself\\nand saying They cannot be here till such a day but all the while\\nhoping for them twelve hours sooner and seeing them arrive at last\\nas if Heaven had given them wings by many hours sooner still\\nIf I could explain to you all this and all that a man can bear and do\\nand glories to do for the sake of these treasures of his existence\\nI speak you know only of such men as have hearts pressing his own\\nwith emotion\\n\\nOh cried Anne eagerly I hope I do justice to all that is felt by you\\nand by those who resemble you  God forbid that I should undervalue\\nthe warm and faithful feelings of any of my fellowcreatures\\nI should deserve utter contempt if I dared to suppose that true attachment\\nand constancy were known only by woman  No I believe you capable\\nof everything great and good in your married lives  I believe you equal\\nto every important exertion and to every domestic forbearance\\nso long asif I may be allowed the expressionso long as you have\\nan object  I mean while the woman you love lives and lives for you\\nAll the privilege I claim for my own sex it is not a very enviable one\\nyou need not covet it is that of loving longest when existence\\nor when hope is gone\\n\\nShe could not immediately have uttered another sentence her heart\\nwas too full her breath too much oppressed\\n\\nYou are a good soul cried Captain Harville putting his hand\\non her arm quite affectionately  There is no quarrelling with you\\nAnd when I think of Benwick my tongue is tied\\n\\nTheir attention was called towards the others  Mrs Croft was taking leave\\n\\nHere Frederick you and I part company I believe said she\\nI am going home and you have an engagement with your friend\\nTonight we may have the pleasure of all meeting again at your party\\nturning to Anne  We had your sisters card yesterday\\nand I understood Frederick had a card too though I did not see it\\nand you are disengaged Frederick are you not as well as ourselves\\n\\nCaptain Wentworth was folding up a letter in great haste and either\\ncould not or would not answer fully\\n\\nYes said he very true here we separate but Harville and I\\nshall soon be after you that is Harville if you are ready\\nI am in half a minute  I know you will not be sorry to be off\\nI shall be at your service in half a minute\\n\\nMrs Croft left them and Captain Wentworth having sealed his letter\\nwith great rapidity was indeed ready and had even a hurried\\nagitated air which shewed impatience to be gone  Anne knew not how\\nto understand it  She had the kindest Good morning God bless you\\nfrom Captain Harville but from him not a word nor a look\\nHe had passed out of the room without a look\\n\\nShe had only time however to move closer to the table where\\nhe had been writing when footsteps were heard returning\\nthe door opened it was himself  He begged their pardon\\nbut he had forgotten his gloves and instantly crossing the room\\nto the writing table he drew out a letter from under the scattered paper\\nplaced it before Anne with eyes of glowing entreaty fixed on her\\nfor a time and hastily collecting his gloves was again out of the room\\nalmost before Mrs Musgrove was aware of his being in it\\nthe work of an instant\\n\\nThe revolution which one instant had made in Anne was almost\\nbeyond expression  The letter with a direction hardly legible\\nto Miss A E was evidently the one which he had been folding\\nso hastily  While supposed to be writing only to Captain Benwick\\nhe had been also addressing her  On the contents of that letter\\ndepended all which this world could do for her  Anything was possible\\nanything might be defied rather than suspense  Mrs Musgrove had\\nlittle arrangements of her own at her own table to their protection\\nshe must trust and sinking into the chair which he had occupied\\nsucceeding to the very spot where he had leaned and written\\nher eyes devoured the following words\\n\\n\\nI can listen no longer in silence  I must speak to you by such means\\nas are within my reach  You pierce my soul  I am half agony\\nhalf hope  Tell me not that I am too late that such precious feelings\\nare gone for ever  I offer myself to you again with a heart\\neven more your own than when you almost broke it eight years\\nand a half ago  Dare not say that man forgets sooner than  woman\\nthat his love has an earlier death  I have loved none but you\\nUnjust I may have been weak and resentful I have been\\nbut never inconstant  You alone have brought me to Bath\\nFor you alone I think and plan  Have you not seen this\\nCan you fail to have understood my wishes  I had not waited even\\nthese ten days could I have read your feelings as I think you must have\\npenetrated mine  I can hardly write  I am every instant hearing\\nsomething which overpowers me  You sink your voice but I can\\ndistinguish the tones of that voice when they would be lost on others\\nToo good too excellent creature  You do us justice indeed\\nYou do believe that there is true attachment and constancy among men\\nBelieve it to be most fervent most undeviating in F W\\n\\nI must go uncertain of my fate but I shall return hither\\nor follow your party as soon as possible  A word a look\\nwill be enough to decide whether I enter your fathers house\\nthis evening or never\\n\\n\\nSuch a letter was not to be soon recovered from  Half and hours solitude\\nand reflection might have tranquillized her but the ten minutes only\\nwhich now passed before she was interrupted with all the restraints\\nof her situation could do nothing towards tranquillity  Every moment\\nrather brought fresh agitation  It was overpowering happiness\\nAnd before she was beyond the first stage of full sensation\\nCharles Mary and Henrietta all came in\\n\\nThe absolute necessity of seeming like herself produced then\\nan immediate struggle but after a while she could do no more\\nShe began not to understand a word they said and was obliged\\nto plead indisposition and excuse herself  They could then see\\nthat she looked very ill were shocked and concerned and would not\\nstir without her for the world  This was dreadful  Would they only\\nhave gone away and left her in the quiet possession of that room\\nit would have been her cure but to have them all standing or\\nwaiting around her was distracting and in desperation\\nshe said she would go home\\n\\nBy all means my dear cried Mrs Musgrove go home directly\\nand take care of yourself that you may be fit for the evening\\nI wish Sarah was here to doctor you but I am no doctor myself\\nCharles ring and order a chair  She must not walk\\n\\nBut the chair would never do  Worse than all  To lose the possibility\\nof speaking two words to Captain Wentworth in the course of her quiet\\nsolitary progress up the town and she felt almost certain of meeting him\\ncould not be borne  The chair was earnestly protested against\\nand Mrs Musgrove who thought only of one sort of illness\\nhaving assured herself with some anxiety that there had been no fall\\nin the case that Anne had not at any time lately slipped down\\nand got a blow on her head that she was perfectly convinced of having\\nhad no fall could part with her cheerfully and depend on\\nfinding her better at night\\n\\nAnxious to omit no possible precaution Anne struggled and said\\n\\nI am afraid maam that it is not perfectly understood\\nPray be so good as to mention to the other gentlemen that we hope\\nto see your whole party this evening  I am afraid there had been\\nsome mistake and I wish you particularly to assure Captain Harville\\nand Captain Wentworth that we hope to see them both\\n\\nOh my dear it is quite understood I give you my word\\nCaptain Harville has no thought but of going\\n\\nDo you think so  But I am afraid and I should be so very sorry\\nWill you promise me to mention it when you see them again\\nYou will see them both this morning I dare say  Do promise me\\n\\nTo be sure I will if you wish it  Charles if you see Captain Harville\\nanywhere remember to give Miss Annes message  But indeed my dear\\nyou need not be uneasy  Captain Harville holds himself quite engaged\\nIll answer for it and Captain Wentworth the same I dare say\\n\\nAnne could do no more but her heart prophesied some mischance\\nto damp the perfection of her felicity  It could not be very lasting\\nhowever  Even if he did not come to Camden Place himself\\nit would be in her power to send an intelligible sentence\\nby Captain Harville  Another momentary vexation occurred\\nCharles in his real concern and good nature would go home with her\\nthere was no preventing him  This was almost cruel  But she could not\\nbe long ungrateful he was sacrificing an engagement at a gunsmiths\\nto be of use to her and she set off with him with no feeling\\nbut gratitude apparent\\n\\nThey were on Union Street when a quicker step behind a something\\nof familiar sound gave her two moments preparation for the sight\\nof Captain Wentworth  He joined them but as if irresolute\\nwhether to join or to pass on said nothing only looked\\nAnne could command herself enough to receive that look\\nand not repulsively  The cheeks which had been pale now glowed\\nand the movements which had hesitated were decided  He walked by her side\\nPresently struck by a sudden thought Charles said\\n\\nCaptain Wentworth which way are you going  Only to Gay Street\\nor farther up the town\\n\\nI hardly know replied Captain Wentworth surprised\\n\\nAre you going as high as Belmont  Are you going near Camden Place\\nBecause if you are I shall have no scruple in asking you\\nto take my place and give Anne your arm to her fathers door\\nShe is rather done for this morning and must not go so far without help\\nand I ought to be at that fellows in the Market Place\\nHe promised me the sight of a capital gun he is just going to send off\\nsaid he would keep it unpacked to the last possible moment\\nthat I might see it and if I do not turn back now I have no chance\\nBy his description a good deal like the second size doublebarrel of mine\\nwhich you shot with one day round Winthrop\\n\\nThere could not be an objection  There could be only the most\\nproper alacrity a most obliging compliance for public view\\nand smiles reined in and spirits dancing in private rapture\\nIn half a minute Charles was at the bottom of Union Street again\\nand the other two proceeding together  and soon words enough had passed\\nbetween them to decide their direction towards the comparatively quiet\\nand retired gravel walk where the power of conversation would make\\nthe present hour a blessing indeed and prepare it for all\\nthe immortality which the happiest recollections of their own future lives\\ncould bestow  There they exchanged again those feelings\\nand those promises which had once before seemed to secure everything\\nbut which had been followed by so many many years of division\\nand estrangement  There they returned again into the past\\nmore exquisitely happy perhaps in their reunion than when\\nit had been first projected more tender more tried more fixed\\nin a knowledge of each others character truth and attachment\\nmore equal to act more justified in acting  And there as they slowly\\npaced the gradual ascent heedless of every group around them\\nseeing neither sauntering politicians bustling housekeepers\\nflirting girls nor nurserymaids and children they could indulge in\\nthose retrospections and acknowledgements and especially in\\nthose explanations of what had directly preceded the present moment\\nwhich were so poignant and so ceaseless in interest  All the little\\nvariations of the last week were gone through and of yesterday\\nand today there could scarcely be an end\\n\\nShe had not mistaken him  Jealousy of Mr Elliot had been\\nthe retarding weight the doubt the torment  That had begun to operate\\nin the very hour of first meeting her in Bath that had returned\\nafter a short suspension to ruin the concert and that had influenced him\\nin everything he had said and done or omitted to say and do\\nin the last fourandtwenty hours  It had been gradually yielding\\nto the better hopes which her looks or words or actions\\noccasionally encouraged it had been vanquished at last by\\nthose sentiments and those tones which had reached him while she talked\\nwith Captain Harville and under the irresistible governance of which\\nhe had seized a sheet of paper and poured out his feelings\\n\\nOf what he had then written nothing was to be retracted or qualified\\nHe persisted in having loved none but her  She had never been supplanted\\nHe never even believed himself to see her equal  Thus much indeed\\nhe was obliged to acknowledge  that he had been constant unconsciously\\nnay unintentionally that he had meant to forget her and believed it\\nto be done  He had imagined himself indifferent when he had only\\nbeen angry and he had been unjust to her merits because he had been\\na sufferer from them  Her character was now fixed on his mind\\nas perfection itself maintaining the loveliest medium of fortitude\\nand gentleness but he was obliged to acknowledge that only at Uppercross\\nhad he learnt to do her justice and only at Lyme had he begun\\nto understand himself  At Lyme he had received lessons\\nof more than one sort  The passing admiration of Mr Elliot\\nhad at least roused him and the scenes on the Cobb and at\\nCaptain Harvilles had fixed her superiority\\n\\nIn his preceding attempts to attach himself to Louisa Musgrove\\nthe attempts of angry pride he protested that he had for ever\\nfelt it to be impossible that he had not cared could not care\\nfor Louisa though till that day till the leisure for reflection\\nwhich followed it he had not understood the perfect excellence\\nof the mind with which Louisas could so ill bear a comparison\\nor the perfect unrivalled hold it possessed over his own\\nThere he had learnt to distinguish between the steadiness of principle\\nand the obstinacy of selfwill between the darings of heedlessness\\nand the resolution of a collected mind  There he had seen everything\\nto exalt in his estimation the woman he had lost and there begun\\nto deplore the pride the folly the madness of resentment\\nwhich had kept him from trying to regain her when thrown in his way\\n\\nFrom that period his penance had become severe  He had no sooner\\nbeen free from the horror and remorse attending the first few days\\nof Louisas accident no sooner begun to feel himself alive again\\nthan he had begun to feel himself though alive not at liberty\\n\\nI found said he that I was considered by Harville an engaged man\\nThat neither Harville nor his wife entertained a doubt of our\\nmutual attachment  I was startled and shocked  To a degree\\nI could contradict this instantly but when I began to reflect\\nthat others might have felt the sameher own family nay\\nperhaps herselfI was no longer at my own disposal  I was hers in honour\\nif she wished it  I had been unguarded  I had not thought seriously\\non this subject before  I had not considered that my excessive intimacy\\nmust have its danger of ill consequence in many ways and that I had\\nno right to be trying whether I could attach myself to either of the girls\\nat the risk of raising even an unpleasant report were there no other\\nill effects  I had been grossly wrong and must abide the consequences\\n\\nHe found too late in short that he had entangled himself\\nand that precisely as he became fully satisfied of his not caring\\nfor Louisa at all he must regard himself as bound to her\\nif her sentiments for him were what the Harvilles supposed\\nIt determined him to leave Lyme and await her complete recovery elsewhere\\nHe would gladly weaken by any fair means whatever feelings or\\nspeculations concerning him might exist and he went therefore\\nto his brothers meaning after a while to return to Kellynch\\nand act as circumstances might require\\n\\nI was six weeks with Edward said he and saw him happy\\nI could have no other pleasure  I deserved none  He enquired after you\\nvery particularly asked even if you were personally altered\\nlittle suspecting that to my eye you could never alter\\n\\nAnne smiled and let it pass  It was too pleasing a blunder\\nfor a reproach  It is something for a woman to be assured\\nin her eightandtwentieth year that she has not lost one charm\\nof earlier youth but the value of such homage was inexpressibly increased\\nto Anne by comparing it with former words and feeling it to be\\nthe result not the cause of a revival of his warm attachment\\n\\nHe had remained in Shropshire lamenting the blindness of his own pride\\nand the blunders of his own calculations till at once released from Louisa\\nby the astonishing and felicitous intelligence of her engagement\\nwith Benwick\\n\\nHere said he ended the worst of my state for now I could at least\\nput myself in the way of happiness I could exert myself\\nI could do something  But to be waiting so long in inaction\\nand waiting only for evil had been dreadful  Within the first\\nfive minutes I said I will be at Bath on Wednesday and I was\\nWas it unpardonable to think it worth my while to come and to arrive\\nwith some degree of hope  You were single  It was possible that\\nyou might retain the feelings of the past as I did and one encouragement\\nhappened to be mine  I could never doubt that you would be loved and\\nsought by others but I knew to a certainty that you had refused one man\\nat least of better pretensions than myself and I could not help\\noften saying Was this for me\\n\\nTheir first meeting in Milsom Street afforded much to be said\\nbut the concert still more  That evening seemed to be made up\\nof exquisite moments  The moment of her stepping forward\\nin the Octagon Room to speak to him  the moment of Mr Elliots appearing\\nand tearing her away and one or two subsequent moments\\nmarked by returning hope or increasing despondency were dwelt on\\nwith energy\\n\\nTo see you cried he in the midst of those who could not be\\nmy wellwishers to see your cousin close by you conversing and smiling\\nand feel all the horrible eligibilities and proprieties of the match\\nTo consider it as the certain wish of every being who could hope\\nto influence you  Even if your own feelings were reluctant or indifferent\\nto consider what powerful supports would be his  Was it not enough\\nto make the fool of me which I appeared  How could I look on\\nwithout agony  Was not the very sight of the friend who sat behind you\\nwas not the recollection of what had been the knowledge of her influence\\nthe indelible immoveable impression of what persuasion had once done\\nwas it not all against me\\n\\nYou should have distinguished replied Anne  You should not have\\nsuspected me now the case is so different and my age is so different\\nIf I was wrong in yielding to persuasion once remember that\\nit was to persuasion exerted on the side of safety not of risk\\nWhen I yielded I thought it was to duty but no duty could be called\\nin aid here  In marrying a man indifferent to me all risk\\nwould have been incurred and all duty violated\\n\\nPerhaps I ought to have reasoned thus he replied but I could not\\nI could not derive benefit from the late knowledge I had acquired\\nof your character  I could not bring it into play it was overwhelmed\\nburied lost in those earlier feelings which I had been smarting under\\nyear after year  I could think of you only as one who had yielded\\nwho had given me up who had been influenced by any one rather than by me\\nI saw you with the very person who had guided you in that year of misery\\nI had no reason to believe her of less authority now  The force of habit\\nwas to be added\\n\\nI should have thought said Anne that my manner to yourself\\nmight have spared you much or all of this\\n\\nNo no your manner might be only the ease which your engagement\\nto another man would give  I left you in this belief and yet\\nI was determined to see you again  My spirits rallied with the morning\\nand I felt that I had still a motive for remaining here\\n\\nAt last Anne was at home again and happier than any one in that house\\ncould have conceived  All the surprise and suspense and every other\\npainful part of the morning dissipated by this conversation\\nshe reentered the house so happy as to be obliged to find an alloy\\nin some momentary apprehensions of its being impossible to last\\nAn interval of meditation serious and grateful was the best corrective\\nof everything dangerous in such highwrought felicity and she went\\nto her room and grew steadfast and fearless in the thankfulness\\nof her enjoyment\\n\\nThe evening came the drawingrooms were lighted up the company assembled\\nIt was but a card party it was but a mixture of those who had\\nnever met before and those who met too often a commonplace business\\ntoo numerous for intimacy too small for variety but Anne had never found\\nan evening shorter  Glowing and lovely in sensibility and happiness\\nand more generally admired than she thought about or cared for\\nshe had cheerful or forbearing feelings for every creature around her\\nMr Elliot was there she avoided but she could pity him\\nThe Wallises she had amusement in understanding them  Lady Dalrymple\\nand Miss Carteretthey would soon be innoxious cousins to her\\nShe cared not for Mrs Clay and had nothing to blush for in\\nthe public manners of her father and sister  With the Musgroves\\nthere was the happy chat of perfect ease with Captain Harville\\nthe kindhearted intercourse of brother and sister with Lady Russell\\nattempts at conversation which a delicious consciousness cut short\\nwith Admiral and Mrs Croft everything of peculiar cordiality and\\nfervent interest which the same consciousness sought to conceal\\nand with Captain Wentworth some moments of communications\\ncontinually occurring and always the hope of more and always\\nthe knowledge of his being there\\n\\nIt was in one of these short meetings each apparently occupied\\nin admiring a fine display of greenhouse plants that she said\\n\\nI have been thinking over the past and trying impartially\\nto judge of the right and wrong I mean with regard to myself\\nand I must believe that I was right much as I suffered from it\\nthat I was perfectly right in being guided by the friend whom\\nyou will love better than you do now  To me she was in the place\\nof a parent  Do not mistake me however  I am not saying\\nthat she did not err in her advice  It was perhaps one of those cases\\nin which advice is good or bad only as the event decides\\nand for myself I certainly never should in any circumstance\\nof tolerable similarity give such advice  But I mean that I was right\\nin submitting to her and that if I had done otherwise I should have\\nsuffered more in continuing the engagement than I did even in giving it up\\nbecause I should have suffered in my conscience  I have now\\nas far as such a sentiment is allowable in human nature nothing\\nto reproach myself with and if I mistake not a strong sense of duty\\nis no bad part of a womans portion\\n\\nHe looked at her looked at Lady Russell and looking again at her\\nreplied as if in cool deliberation\\n\\nNot yet  But there are hopes of her being forgiven in time\\nI trust to being in charity with her soon  But I too have been\\nthinking over the past and a  question has suggested itself\\nwhether there may not have been one person more my enemy\\neven than that lady  My own self  Tell me if when I returned\\nto England in the year eight with a few thousand pounds\\nand was posted into the Laconia if I had then written to you\\nwould you have answered my letter  Would you in short\\nhave renewed the engagement then\\n\\nWould I was all her answer but the accent was decisive enough\\n\\nGood God he cried you would  It is not that I did not think of it\\nor desire it as what could alone crown all my other success\\nbut I was proud too proud to ask again  I did not understand you\\nI shut my eyes and would not understand you or do you justice\\nThis is a recollection which ought to make me forgive every one\\nsooner than myself  Six years of separation and suffering\\nmight have been spared  It is a sort of pain too which is new to me\\nI have been used to the gratification of believing myself to earn\\nevery blessing that I enjoyed  I have valued myself on honourable toils\\nand just rewards  Like other great men under reverses he added\\nwith a smile I must endeavour to subdue my mind to my fortune\\nI must learn to brook being happier than I deserve\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 24\\n\\n\\nWho can be in doubt of what followed  When any two young people\\ntake it into their heads to marry they are pretty sure by perseverance\\nto carry their point be they ever so poor or ever so imprudent\\nor ever so little likely to be necessary to each others ultimate comfort\\nThis may be bad morality to conclude with but I believe it to be truth\\nand if such parties succeed how should a Captain Wentworth and\\nan Anne Elliot with the advantage of maturity of mind\\nconsciousness of right and one independent fortune between them\\nfail of bearing down every opposition  They might in fact\\nhave borne down a great deal more than they met with for there was\\nlittle to distress them beyond the want of graciousness and warmth\\nSir Walter made no objection and Elizabeth did nothing worse\\nthan look cold and unconcerned  Captain Wentworth with fiveandtwenty\\nthousand pounds and as high in his profession as merit and activity\\ncould place him was no longer nobody  He was now esteemed quite worthy\\nto address the daughter of a foolish spendthrift baronet\\nwho had not had principle or sense enough to maintain himself\\nin the situation in which Providence had placed him and who could\\ngive his daughter at present but a small part of the share\\nof ten thousand pounds which must be hers hereafter\\n\\nSir Walter indeed though he had no affection for Anne\\nand no vanity flattered to make him really happy on the occasion\\nwas very far from thinking it a bad match for her  On the contrary\\nwhen he saw more of Captain Wentworth saw him repeatedly by daylight\\nand eyed him well he was very much struck by his personal claims\\nand felt that his superiority of appearance might be not unfairly balanced\\nagainst her superiority of rank and all this assisted by\\nhis wellsounding name enabled Sir Walter at last to prepare his pen\\nwith a very good grace for the insertion of the marriage\\nin the volume of honour\\n\\nThe only one among them whose opposition of feeling could excite\\nany serious anxiety was Lady Russell  Anne knew that Lady Russell\\nmust be suffering some pain in understanding and relinquishing Mr Elliot\\nand be making some struggles to become truly acquainted with\\nand do justice to Captain Wentworth  This however was what\\nLady Russell had now to do  She must learn to feel that she had\\nbeen mistaken with regard to both that she had been unfairly influenced\\nby appearances in each that because Captain Wentworths manners\\nhad not suited her own ideas she had been too quick in suspecting them\\nto indicate a character of dangerous impetuosity and that because\\nMr Elliots manners had precisely pleased her in their propriety\\nand correctness their general politeness and suavity she had been\\ntoo quick in receiving them as the certain result of the most correct\\nopinions and wellregulated mind  There was nothing less\\nfor Lady Russell to do than to admit that she had been\\npretty completely wrong and to take up a new set of opinions\\nand of hopes\\n\\nThere is a quickness of perception in some a nicety in the discernment\\nof character a natural penetration in short which no experience\\nin others can equal and Lady Russell had been less gifted\\nin this part of understanding than her young friend  But she was\\na very good woman and if her second object was to be sensible\\nand welljudging her first was to see Anne happy  She loved Anne\\nbetter than she loved her own abilities and when the awkwardness\\nof the beginning was over found little hardship in attaching herself\\nas a mother to the man who was securing the happiness of her other child\\n\\nOf all the family Mary was probably the one most immediately gratified\\nby the circumstance  It was creditable to have a sister married\\nand she might flatter herself with having been greatly instrumental\\nto the connexion by keeping Anne with her in the autumn\\nand as her own sister must be better than her husbands sisters\\nit was very agreeable that Captain Wentworth should be a richer man than\\neither Captain Benwick or Charles Hayter  She had something to suffer\\nperhaps when they came into contact again in seeing Anne restored\\nto the rights of seniority and the mistress of a very pretty landaulette\\nbut she had a future to look forward to of powerful consolation\\nAnne had no Uppercross Hall before her no landed estate\\nno headship of a family and if they could but keep Captain Wentworth\\nfrom being made a baronet she would not change situations with Anne\\n\\nIt would be well for the eldest sister if she were equally satisfied\\nwith her situation for a change is not very probable there\\nShe had soon the mortification of seeing Mr Elliot withdraw\\nand no one of proper condition has since presented himself to raise\\neven the unfounded hopes which sunk with him\\n\\nThe news of his cousins Annes engagement burst on Mr Elliot\\nmost unexpectedly  It deranged his best plan of domestic happiness\\nhis best hope of keeping Sir Walter single by the watchfulness\\nwhich a soninlaws rights would have given  But though discomfited\\nand disappointed he could still do something for his own interest\\nand his own enjoyment  He soon quitted Bath and on Mrs Clays\\nquitting it soon afterwards and being next heard of as established\\nunder his protection in London it was evident how double a game\\nhe had been playing and how determined he was to save himself\\nfrom being cut out by one artful woman at least\\n\\nMrs Clays affections had overpowered her interest and she had sacrificed\\nfor the young mans sake the possibility of scheming longer\\nfor Sir Walter  She has abilities however as well as affections\\nand it is now a doubtful point whether his cunning or hers\\nmay finally carry the day whether after preventing her from being\\nthe wife of Sir Walter he may not be wheedled and caressed at last\\ninto making her the wife of Sir William\\n\\nIt cannot be doubted that Sir Walter and Elizabeth were shocked\\nand mortified by the loss of their companion and the discovery of\\ntheir deception in her  They had their great cousins to be sure\\nto resort to for comfort but they must long feel that to flatter\\nand follow others without being flattered and followed in turn\\nis but a state of half enjoyment\\n\\nAnne satisfied at a very early period of Lady Russells meaning\\nto love Captain Wentworth as she ought had no other alloy\\nto the happiness of her prospects than what arose from the consciousness\\nof having no relations to bestow on him which a man of sense could value\\nThere she felt her own inferiority very keenly  The disproportion\\nin their fortune was nothing it did not give her a moments regret\\nbut to have no family to receive and estimate him properly\\nnothing of respectability of harmony of good will to offer\\nin return for all the worth and all the prompt welcome which met her\\nin his brothers and sisters was a source of as lively pain\\nas her mind could well be sensible of under circumstances of otherwise\\nstrong felicity  She had but two friends in the world to add to his list\\nLady Russell and Mrs Smith  To those however he was very well disposed\\nto attach himself  Lady Russell in spite of all her former transgressions\\nhe could now value from his heart  While he was not obliged to say\\nthat he believed her to have been right in originally dividing them\\nhe was ready to say almost everything else in her favour\\nand as for Mrs Smith she had claims of various kinds to recommend her\\nquickly and permanently\\n\\nHer recent good offices by Anne had been enough in themselves\\nand their marriage instead of depriving her of one friend\\nsecured her two  She was their earliest visitor in their settled life\\nand Captain Wentworth by putting her in the way of recovering\\nher husbands property in the West Indies by writing for her\\nacting for her and seeing her through all the petty difficulties\\nof the case with the activity and exertion of a fearless man\\nand a determined friend fully requited the services which\\nshe had rendered or ever meant to render to his wife\\n\\nMrs Smiths enjoyments were not spoiled by this improvement of income\\nwith some improvement of health and the acquisition of such friends\\nto be often with for her cheerfulness and mental alacrity did not\\nfail her and while these prime supplies of good remained she might have\\nbid defiance even to greater accessions of worldly prosperity\\nShe might have been absolutely rich and perfectly healthy\\nand yet be happy  Her spring of felicity was in the glow\\nof her spirits as her friend Annes was in the warmth of her heart\\nAnne was tenderness itself and she had the full worth of it\\nin Captain Wentworths affection  His profession was all that could ever\\nmake her friends wish that tenderness less the dread of a future war\\nall that could dim her sunshine  She gloried in being a sailors wife\\nbut she must pay the tax of quick alarm for belonging to that profession\\nwhich is if possible more distinguished in its domestic virtues\\nthan in its national importance\\n\\n\\n\\n        Finis\\n\\n\\n\\n'"

idle hour and consolation in a\\ndistressed one there his faculties were roused into admiration and\\nrespect by contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patents\\nthere any unwelcome sensations arising from domestic affairs\\nchanged naturally into pity and contempt as he turned over\\nthe almost endless creations of the last century and there\\nif every other leaf were powerless he could read his own history\\nwith an interest which never failed  This was the page at which\\nthe favourite volume always opened\\n\\n           ELLIOT OF KELLYNCH HALL\\n\\nWalter Elliot born March 1 1760 married July 15 1784 Elizabeth\\ndaughter of James Stevenson Esq of South Park in the county of\\nGloucester by which lady who died 1800 he has issue Elizabeth\\nborn June 1 1785 Anne born August 9 1787 a stillborn son\\nNovember 5 1789 Mary born November 20 1791\\n\\nPrecisely such had the paragraph originally stood from the printers hands\\nbut Sir Walter had improved it by adding for the information of\\nhimself and his family these words after the date of Marys birth\\nMarried December 16 1810 Charles son and heir of Charles\\nMusgrove Esq of Uppercross in the county of Somerset\\nand by inserting most accurately the day of the month on which\\nhe had lost his wife\\n\\nThen followed the history and rise of the ancient and respectable family\\nin the usual terms how it had been first settled in Cheshire\\nhow mentioned in Dugdale serving the office of high sheriff\\nrepresenting a borough in three successive parliaments\\nexertions of loyalty and dignity of baronet in the first year\\nof Charles II with all the Marys and Elizabeths they had married\\nforming altogether two handsome duodecimo pages and concluding with\\nthe arms and mottoPrincipal seat Kellynch Hall in the county\\nof Somerset and Sir Walters handwriting again in this finale\\n\\nHeir presumptive William Walter Elliot Esq great grandson of\\nthe second Sir Walter\\n\\nVanity was the beginning and the end of Sir Walter Elliots character\\nvanity of person and of situation  He had been remarkably handsome\\nin his youth and at fiftyfour was still a very fine man\\nFew women could think more of their personal appearance than he did\\nnor could the valet of any new made lord be more delighted with\\nthe place he held in society  He considered the blessing of beauty\\nas inferior only to the blessing of a baronetcy and the Sir Walter Elliot\\nwho united these gifts was the constant object of his warmest respect\\nand devotion\\n\\nHis good looks and his rank had one fair claim on his attachment\\nsince to them he must have owed a wife of very superior character\\nto any thing deserved by his own  Lady Elliot had been an excellent woman\\nsensible and amiable whose judgement and conduct if they might be\\npardoned the youthful infatuation which made her Lady Elliot\\nhad never required indulgence afterwardsShe had humoured\\nor softened or concealed his failings and promoted his real\\nrespectability for seventeen years and though not the very happiest\\nbeing in the world herself had found enough in her duties her friends\\nand her children to attach her to life and make it no matter of\\nindifference to her when she was called on to quit them\\nThree girls the two eldest sixteen and fourteen was an awful legacy\\nfor a mother to bequeath an awful charge rather to confide to\\nthe authority and guidance of a conceited silly father\\nShe had however one very intimate friend a sensible deserving woman\\nwho had been brought by strong attachment to herself to settle\\nclose by her in the village of Kellynch and on her kindness and advice\\nLady Elliot mainly relied for the best help and maintenance of\\nthe good principles and instruction which she had been anxiously\\ngiving her daughters\\n\\nThis friend and Sir Walter did not marry whatever might have been\\nanticipated on that head by their acquaintance  Thirteen years\\nhad passed away since Lady Elliots death and they were still\\nnear neighbours and intimate friends and one remained a widower\\nthe other a widow\\n\\nThat Lady Russell of steady age and character and extremely\\nwell provided for should have no thought of a second marriage\\nneeds no apology to the public which is rather apt to be unreasonably\\ndiscontented when a woman does marry again than when she does not\\nbut Sir Walters continuing in singleness requires explanation\\nBe it known then that Sir Walter like a good father having met with\\none or two private disappointments in very unreasonable applications\\nprided himself on remaining single for his dear daughters sake\\nFor one daughter his eldest he would really have given up any thing\\nwhich he had not been very much tempted to do  Elizabeth had succeeded\\nat sixteen to all that was possible of her mothers rights\\nand consequence and being very handsome and very like himself\\nher influence had always been great and they had gone on together\\nmost happily  His two other children were of very inferior value\\nMary had acquired a little artificial importance by becoming\\nMrs Charles Musgrove but Anne with an elegance of mind and sweetness\\nof character which must have placed her high with any people\\nof real understanding was nobody with either father or sister\\nher word had no weight her convenience was always to give way\\nshe was only Anne\\n\\nTo Lady Russell indeed she was a most dear and highly valued\\ngoddaughter favourite and friend  Lady Russell loved them all\\nbut it was only in Anne that she could fancy the mother to revive again\\n\\nA few years before Anne Elliot had been a very pretty girl\\nbut her bloom had vanished early and as even in its height\\nher father had found little to admire in her so totally different\\nwere her delicate features and mild dark eyes from his own\\nthere could be nothing in them now that she was faded and thin\\nto excite his esteem He had never indulged much hope he had now none\\nof ever reading her name in any other page of his favourite work\\nAll equality of alliance must rest with Elizabeth for Mary had merely\\nconnected herself with an old country family of respectability and\\nlarge fortune and had therefore given all the honour and received none\\nElizabeth would one day or other marry suitably\\n\\nIt sometimes happens that a woman is handsomer at twentynine than\\nshe was ten years before and generally speaking if there has been\\nneither ill health nor anxiety it is a time of life at which scarcely any\\ncharm is lost  It was so with Elizabeth still the same handsome\\nMiss Elliot that she had begun to be thirteen years ago and Sir Walter\\nmight be excused therefore in forgetting her age or at least\\nbe deemed only half a fool for thinking himself and Elizabeth\\nas blooming as ever amidst the wreck of the good looks of everybody else\\nfor he could plainly see how old all the rest of his family and\\nacquaintance were growing  Anne haggard Mary coarse every face\\nin the neighbourhood worsting and the rapid increase of the crows foot\\nabout Lady Russells temples had long been a distress to him\\n\\nElizabeth did not quite equal her father in personal contentment\\nThirteen years had seen her mistress of Kellynch Hall presiding and\\ndirecting with a selfpossession and decision which could never have given\\nthe idea of her being younger than she was  For thirteen years had\\nshe been doing the honours and laying down the domestic law at home\\nand leading the way to the chaise and four and walking immediately after\\nLady Russell out of all the drawingrooms and diningrooms in the country\\nThirteen winters revolving frosts had seen her opening every ball\\nof credit which a scanty neighbourhood afforded and thirteen springs\\nshewn their blossoms as she travelled up to London with her father\\nfor a few weeks annual enjoyment of the great world  She had\\nthe remembrance of all this she had the consciousness of being\\nnineandtwenty to give her some regrets and some apprehensions\\nshe was fully satisfied of being still quite as handsome as ever\\nbut she felt her approach to the years of danger and would have rejoiced\\nto be certain of being properly solicited by baronetblood within\\nthe next twelvemonth or two  Then might she again take up\\nthe book of books with as much enjoyment as in her early youth\\nbut now she liked it not  Always to be presented with the date of\\nher own birth and see no marriage follow but that of a youngest sister\\nmade the book an evil and more than once when her father had left it\\nopen on the table near her had she closed it with averted eyes\\nand pushed it away\\n\\nShe had had a disappointment moreover which that book\\nand especially the history of her own family must ever present\\nthe remembrance of  The heir presumptive the very William Walter\\nElliot Esq whose rights had been so generously supported\\nby her father had disappointed her\\n\\nShe had while a very young girl as soon as she had known him to be\\nin the event of her having no brother the future baronet\\nmeant to marry him and her father had always meant that she should\\nHe had not been known to them as a boy but soon after Lady Elliots death\\nSir Walter had sought the acquaintance and though his overtures\\nhad not been met with any warmth he had persevered in seeking it\\nmaking allowance for the modest drawingback of youth and in one of\\ntheir spring excursions to London when Elizabeth was in her first bloom\\nMr Elliot had been forced into the introduction\\n\\nHe was at that time a very young man just engaged in the study of the law\\nand Elizabeth found him extremely agreeable and every plan in his favour\\nwas confirmed  He was invited to Kellynch Hall he was talked of\\nand expected all the rest of the year but he never came\\nThe following spring he was seen again in town found equally agreeable\\nagain encouraged invited and expected and again he did not come\\nand the next tidings were that he was married  Instead of pushing\\nhis fortune in the line marked out for the heir of the house of Elliot\\nhe had purchased independence by uniting himself to a rich woman\\nof inferior birth\\n\\nSir Walter has resented it  As the head of the house he felt that\\nhe ought to have been consulted especially after taking the young man\\nso publicly by the hand For they must have been seen together\\nhe observed once at Tattersalls and twice in the lobby of\\nthe House of Commons  His disapprobation was expressed\\nbut apparently very little regarded  Mr Elliot had attempted no apology\\nand shewn himself as unsolicitous of being longer noticed by the family\\nas Sir Walter considered him unworthy of it  all acquaintance between\\nthem had ceased\\n\\nThis very awkward history of Mr Elliot was still after an interval\\nof several years felt with anger by Elizabeth who had liked the man\\nfor himself and still more for being her fathers heir and whose\\nstrong family pride could see only in him a proper match for Sir Walter\\nElliots eldest daughter  There was not a baronet from A to Z whom\\nher feelings could have so willingly acknowledged as an equal\\nYet so miserably had he conducted himself that though she was\\nat this present time the summer of 1814 wearing black ribbons\\nfor his wife she could not admit him to be worth thinking of again\\nThe disgrace of his first marriage might perhaps as there was\\nno reason to suppose it perpetuated by offspring have been got over\\nhad he not done worse but he had as by the accustomary intervention\\nof kind friends they had been informed spoken most disrespectfully\\nof them all most slightingly and contemptuously of the very blood\\nhe belonged to and the honours which were hereafter to be his own\\nThis could not be pardoned\\n\\nSuch were Elizabeth Elliots sentiments and sensations such the cares\\nto alloy the agitations to vary the sameness and the elegance\\nthe prosperity and the nothingness of her scene of life\\nsuch the feelings to give interest to a long uneventful residence\\nin one country circle to fill the vacancies which there were no habits\\nof utility abroad no talents or accomplishments for home to occupy\\n\\nBut now another occupation and solicitude of mind was beginning to be\\nadded to these  Her father was growing distressed for money\\nShe knew that when he now took up the Baronetage it was to drive\\nthe heavy bills of his tradespeople and the unwelcome hints of\\nMr Shepherd his agent from his thoughts  The Kellynch property was good\\nbut not equal to Sir Walters apprehension of the state required\\nin its possessor  While Lady Elliot lived there had been method\\nmoderation and economy which had just kept him within his income\\nbut with her had died all such rightmindedness and from that period\\nhe had been constantly exceeding it  It had not been possible\\nfor him to spend less he had done nothing but what Sir Walter Elliot\\nwas imperiously called on to do but blameless as he was he was\\nnot only growing dreadfully in debt but was hearing of it so often\\nthat it became vain to attempt concealing it longer even partially\\nfrom his daughter  He had given her some hints of it the last spring\\nin town he had gone so far even as to say Can we retrench\\nDoes it occur to you that there is any one article in which\\nwe can retrench and Elizabeth to do her justice had in the first\\nardour of female alarm set seriously to think what could be done\\nand had finally proposed these two branches of economy to cut off\\nsome unnecessary charities and to refrain from new furnishing\\nthe drawingroom to which expedients she afterwards added\\nthe happy thought of their taking no present down to Anne\\nas had been the usual yearly custom  But these measures\\nhowever good in themselves were insufficient for the real extent\\nof the evil the whole of which Sir Walter found himself obliged\\nto confess to her soon afterwards  Elizabeth had nothing to propose\\nof deeper efficacy  She felt herself illused and unfortunate\\nas did her father and they were neither of them able to devise\\nany means of lessening their expenses without compromising their dignity\\nor relinquishing their comforts in a way not to be borne\\n\\nThere was only a small part of his estate that Sir Walter could dispose of\\nbut had every acre been alienable it would have made no difference\\nHe had condescended to mortgage as far as he had the power\\nbut he would never condescend to sell  No he would never disgrace\\nhis name so far  The Kellynch estate should be transmitted whole\\nand entire as he had received it\\n\\nTheir two confidential friends Mr Shepherd who lived in\\nthe neighbouring market town and Lady Russell were called to advise them\\nand both father and daughter seemed to expect that something should be\\nstruck out by one or the other to remove their embarrassments\\nand reduce their expenditure without involving the loss of\\nany indulgence of taste or pride\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 2\\n\\n\\nMr Shepherd a civil cautious lawyer who whatever might be his hold\\nor his views on Sir Walter would rather have the disagreeable\\nprompted by anybody else excused himself from offering the slightest hint\\nand only begged leave to recommend an implicit reference to\\nthe excellent judgement of Lady Russell from whose known good sense\\nhe fully expected to have just such resolute measures advised as\\nhe meant to see finally adopted\\n\\nLady Russell was most anxiously zealous on the subject and gave it\\nmuch serious consideration  She was a woman rather of sound than of\\nquick abilities whose difficulties in coming to any decision\\nin this instance were great from the opposition of two leading principles\\nShe was of strict integrity herself with a delicate sense of honour\\nbut she was as desirous of saving Sir Walters feelings as solicitous\\nfor the credit of the family as aristocratic in her ideas of what\\nwas due to them as anybody of sense and honesty could well be\\nShe was a benevolent charitable good woman and capable of\\nstrong attachments most correct in her conduct strict in her notions\\nof decorum and with manners that were held a standard of goodbreeding\\nShe had a cultivated mind and was generally speaking\\nrational and consistent but she had prejudices on the side of ancestry\\nshe had a value for rank and consequence which blinded her a little\\nto the faults of those who possessed them  Herself the widow of\\nonly a knight she gave the dignity of a baronet all its due\\nand Sir Walter independent of his claims as an old acquaintance\\nan attentive neighbour an obliging landlord the husband of her\\nvery dear friend the father of Anne and her sisters was\\nas being Sir Walter in her apprehension entitled to a great deal\\nof compassion and consideration under his present difficulties\\n\\nThey must retrench that did not admit of a doubt  But she was\\nvery anxious to have it done with the least possible pain to him\\nand Elizabeth She drew up plans of economy she made exact calculations\\nand she did what nobody else thought of doing  she consulted Anne\\nwho never seemed considered by the others as having any interest\\nin the question She consulted and in a degree was influenced by her\\nin marking out the scheme of retrenchment which was at last submitted\\nto Sir Walter Every emendation of Annes had been on the side of\\nhonesty against importance  She wanted more vigorous measures\\na more complete reformation a quicker release from debt\\na much higher tone of indifference for everything but justice and equity\\n\\nIf we can persuade your father to all this said Lady Russell\\nlooking over her paper much may be done  If he will adopt\\nthese regulations in seven years he will be clear and I hope\\nwe may be able to convince him and Elizabeth that Kellynch Hall has\\na respectability in itself which cannot be affected by these reductions\\nand that the true dignity of Sir Walter Elliot will be very far from\\nlessened in the eyes of sensible people by acting like a man of principle\\nWhat will he be doing in fact but what very many of our first families\\nhave done or ought to do  There will be nothing singular in his case\\nand it is singularity which often makes the worst part of our suffering\\nas it always does of our conduct  I have great hope of prevailing\\nWe must be serious and decided for after all the person who\\nhas contracted debts must pay them and though a great deal is due to\\nthe feelings of the gentleman and the head of a house like your father\\nthere is still more due to the character of an honest man\\n\\nThis was the principle on which Anne wanted her father to be proceeding\\nhis friends to be urging him  She considered it as an act\\nof indispensable duty to clear away the claims of creditors with\\nall the expedition which the most comprehensive retrenchments\\ncould secure and saw no dignity in anything short of it\\nShe wanted it to be prescribed and felt as a duty  She rated\\nLady Russells influence highly and as to the severe degree\\nof selfdenial which her own conscience prompted she believed\\nthere might be little more difficulty in persuading them to a complete\\nthan to half a reformation  Her knowledge of her father\\nand Elizabeth inclined her to think that the sacrifice of one pair\\nof horses would be hardly less painful than of both and so on\\nthrough the whole list of Lady Russells too gentle reductions\\n\\nHow Annes more rigid requisitions might have been taken\\nis of little consequence  Lady Russells had no success at all\\ncould not be put up with were not to be borne What every comfort\\nof life knocked off  Journeys London servants horses table\\ncontractions and restrictions every where  To live no longer\\nwith the decencies even of a private gentleman  No he would sooner\\nquit Kellynch Hall at once than remain in it on such disgraceful terms\\n\\nQuit Kellynch Hall  The hint was immediately taken up by Mr Shepherd\\nwhose interest was involved in the reality of Sir Walters retrenching\\nand who was perfectly persuaded that nothing would be done without\\na change of abode  Since the idea had been started in the very quarter\\nwhich ought to dictate he had no scruple he said in confessing\\nhis judgement to be entirely on that side  It did not appear to him\\nthat Sir Walter could materially alter his style of living in a house\\nwhich had such a character of hospitality and ancient dignity to support\\nIn any other place Sir Walter might judge for himself and would\\nbe looked up to as regulating the modes of life in whatever way\\nhe might choose to model his household\\n\\nSir Walter would quit Kellynch Hall and after a very few days more\\nof doubt and indecision the great question of whither he should go\\nwas settled and the first outline of this important change made out\\n\\nThere had been three alternatives London Bath or another house\\nin the country  All Annes wishes had been for the latter\\nA small house in their own neighbourhood where they might still have\\nLady Russells society still be near Mary and still have the pleasure\\nof sometimes seeing the lawns and groves of Kellynch was the object\\nof her ambition  But the usual fate of Anne attended her\\nin having something very opposite from her inclination fixed on\\nShe disliked Bath and did not think it agreed with her\\nand Bath was to be her home\\n\\nSir Walter had at first thought more of London but Mr Shepherd felt\\nthat he could not be trusted in London and had been skilful enough\\nto dissuade him from it and make Bath preferred  It was a much safer\\nplace for a gentleman in his predicament  he might there be important\\nat comparatively little expense  Two material advantages of Bath\\nover London had of course been given all their weight  its more convenient\\ndistance from Kellynch only fifty miles and Lady Russells spending\\nsome part of every winter there and to the very great satisfaction\\nof Lady Russell whose first views on the projected change had been\\nfor Bath Sir Walter and Elizabeth were induced to believe that\\nthey should lose neither consequence nor enjoyment by settling there\\n\\nLady Russell felt obliged to oppose her dear Annes known wishes\\nIt would be too much to expect Sir Walter to descend into a small house\\nin his own neighbourhood  Anne herself would have found\\nthe mortifications of it more than she foresaw and to Sir Walters\\nfeelings they must have been dreadful  And with regard to Annes\\ndislike of Bath she considered it as a prejudice and mistake arising\\nfirst from the circumstance of her having been three years\\nat school there after her mothers death and secondly\\nfrom her happening to be not in perfectly good spirits the only winter\\nwhich she had afterwards spent there with herself\\n\\nLady Russell was fond of Bath in short and disposed to think\\nit must suit them all and as to her young friends health\\nby passing all the warm months with her at Kellynch Lodge\\nevery danger would be avoided and it was in fact a change which must\\ndo both health and spirits good  Anne had been too little from home\\ntoo little seen Her spirits were not high  A larger society\\nwould improve them  She wanted her to be more known\\n\\nThe undesirableness of any other house in the same neighbourhood\\nfor Sir Walter was certainly much strengthened by one part\\nand a very material part of the scheme which had been happily\\nengrafted on the beginning  He was not only to quit his home\\nbut to see it in the hands of others a trial of fortitude\\nwhich stronger heads than Sir Walters have found too much\\nKellynch Hall was to be let  This however was a profound secret\\nnot to be breathed beyond their own circle\\n\\nSir Walter could not have borne the degradation of being known\\nto design letting his house  Mr Shepherd had once mentioned the word\\nadvertise but never dared approach it again  Sir Walter spurned\\nthe idea of its being offered in any manner forbad the slightest hint\\nbeing dropped of his having such an intention and it was only on\\nthe supposition of his being spontaneously solicited by some most\\nunexceptionable applicant on his own terms and as a great favour\\nthat he would let it at all\\n\\nHow quick come the reasons for approving what we like  Lady Russell had\\nanother excellent one at hand for being extremely glad that Sir Walter\\nand his family were to remove from the country  Elizabeth had been\\nlately forming an intimacy which she wished to see interrupted\\nIt was with the daughter of Mr Shepherd who had returned\\nafter an unprosperous marriage to her fathers house with\\nthe additional burden of two children  She was a clever young woman\\nwho understood the art of pleasingthe art of pleasing at least\\nat Kellynch Hall and who had made herself so acceptable to Miss Elliot\\nas to have been already staying there more than once in spite of all\\nthat Lady Russell who thought it a friendship quite out of place\\ncould hint of caution and reserve\\n\\nLady Russell indeed had scarcely any influence with Elizabeth\\nand seemed to love her rather because she would love her\\nthan because Elizabeth deserved it  She had never received from her more\\nthan outward attention nothing beyond the observances of complaisance\\nhad never succeeded in any point which she wanted to carry\\nagainst previous inclination  She had been repeatedly very earnest\\nin trying to get Anne included in the visit to London sensibly open\\nto all the injustice and all the discredit of the selfish arrangements\\nwhich shut her out and on many lesser occasions had endeavoured\\nto give Elizabeth the advantage of her own better judgement and experience\\nbut always in vain  Elizabeth would go her own way and never had she\\npursued it in more decided opposition to Lady Russell than in\\nthis selection of Mrs Clay turning from the society of so deserving\\na sister to bestow her affection and confidence on one who ought\\nto have been nothing to her but the object of distant civility\\n\\nFrom situation Mrs Clay was in Lady Russells estimate a very unequal\\nand in her character she believed a very dangerous companion\\nand a removal that would leave Mrs Clay behind and bring a choice\\nof more suitable intimates within Miss Elliots reach was therefore\\nan object of firstrate importance\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 3\\n\\n\\nI must take leave to observe Sir Walter said Mr Shepherd\\none morning at Kellynch Hall as he laid down the newspaper\\nthat the present juncture is much in our favour  This peace will\\nbe turning all our rich naval officers ashore  They will be\\nall wanting a home  Could not be a better time Sir Walter\\nfor having a choice of tenants very responsible tenants\\nMany a noble fortune has been made during the war  If a rich admiral\\nwere to come in our way Sir Walter\\n\\nHe would be a very lucky man Shepherd replied Sir Walter\\nthats all I have to remark  A prize indeed would Kellynch Hall\\nbe to him rather the greatest prize of all let him have taken\\never so many before hey Shepherd\\n\\nMr Shepherd laughed as he knew he must at this wit and then added\\n\\nI presume to observe Sir Walter that in the way of business\\ngentlemen of the navy are well to deal with  I have had a little knowledge\\nof their methods of doing business and I am free to confess that they\\nhave very liberal notions and are as likely to make desirable tenants\\nas any set of people one should meet with  Therefore Sir Walter\\nwhat I would take leave to suggest is that if in consequence of\\nany rumours getting abroad of your intention which must be contemplated\\nas a possible thing because we know how difficult it is to keep\\nthe actions and designs of one part of the world from the notice\\nand curiosity of the other consequence has its tax I John Shepherd\\nmight conceal any familymatters that I chose for nobody would think it\\nworth their while to observe me but Sir Walter Elliot has eyes upon him\\nwhich it may be very difficult to elude and therefore thus much\\nI venture upon that it will not greatly surprise me if\\nwith all our caution some rumour of the truth should get abroad\\nin the supposition of which as I was going to observe since applications\\nwill unquestionably follow I should think any from our wealthy\\nnaval commanders particularly worth attending to and beg leave to add\\nthat two hours will bring me over at any time to save you\\nthe trouble of replying\\n\\nSir Walter only nodded  But soon afterwards rising and pacing the room\\nhe observed sarcastically\\n\\nThere are few among the gentlemen of the navy I imagine who would\\nnot be surprised to find themselves in a house of this description\\n\\nThey would look around them no doubt and bless their good fortune\\nsaid Mrs Clay for Mrs Clay was present  her father had driven her over\\nnothing being of so much use to Mrs Clays health as a drive to Kellynch\\nbut I quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might be\\na very desirable tenant  I have known a good deal of the profession\\nand besides their liberality they are so neat and careful\\nin all their ways  These valuable pictures of yours Sir Walter\\nif you chose to leave them would be perfectly safe  Everything in\\nand about the house would be taken such excellent care of\\nThe gardens and shrubberies would be kept in almost as high order\\nas they are now  You need not be afraid Miss Elliot of your own\\nsweet flower gardens being neglected\\n\\nAs to all that rejoined Sir Walter coolly supposing I were induced\\nto let my house I have by no means made up my mind as to the privileges\\nto be annexed to it  I am not particularly disposed to favour a tenant\\nThe park would be open to him of course and few navy officers\\nor men of any other description can have had such a range\\nbut what restrictions I might impose on the use of the pleasuregrounds\\nis another thing  I am not fond of the idea of my shrubberies being\\nalways approachable and I should recommend Miss Elliot to be on her guard\\nwith respect to her flower garden  I am very little disposed\\nto grant a tenant of Kellynch Hall any extraordinary favour\\nI assure you be he sailor or soldier\\n\\nAfter a short pause Mr Shepherd presumed to say\\n\\nIn all these cases there are established usages which\\nmake everything plain and easy between landlord and tenant\\nYour interest Sir Walter is in pretty safe hands  Depend upon me\\nfor taking care that no tenant has more than his just rights\\nI venture to hint that Sir Walter Elliot cannot be half so jealous\\nfor his own as John Shepherd will be for him\\n\\nHere Anne spoke\\n\\nThe navy I think who have done so much for us have at least\\nan equal claim with any other set of men for all the comforts and\\nall the privileges which any home can give  Sailors work hard enough\\nfor their comforts we must all allow\\n\\nVery true very true  What Miss Anne says is very true\\nwas Mr Shepherds rejoinder and Oh certainly was his daughters\\nbut Sir Walters remark was soon afterwards\\n\\nThe profession has its utility but I should be sorry to see\\nany friend of mine belonging to it\\n\\nIndeed was the reply and with a look of surprise\\n\\nYes it is in two points offensive to me I have two strong grounds\\nof objection to it  First as being the means of bringing persons\\nof obscure birth into undue distinction and raising men to honours\\nwhich their fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of and secondly\\nas it cuts up a mans youth and vigour most horribly a sailor grows old\\nsooner than any other man  I have observed it all my life\\nA man is in greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise\\nof one whose father his father might have disdained to speak to\\nand of becoming prematurely an object of disgust himself than in\\nany other line  One day last spring in town I was in company\\nwith two men striking instances of what I am talking of\\nLord St Ives whose father we all know to have been a country curate\\nwithout bread to eat I was to give place to Lord St Ives\\nand a certain Admiral Baldwin the most deplorablelooking personage\\nyou can imagine his face the colour of mahogany rough and rugged\\nto the last degree all lines and wrinkles nine grey hairs of a side\\nand nothing but a dab of powder at top  In the name of heaven\\nwho is that old fellow said I to a friend of mine who was standing near\\nSir Basil Morley  Old fellow cried Sir Basil it is Admiral Baldwin\\nWhat do you take his age to be  Sixty said I or perhaps sixtytwo\\nForty replied Sir Basil forty and no more  Picture to yourselves\\nmy amazement I shall not easily forget Admiral Baldwin\\nI never saw quite so wretched an example of what a seafaring life can do\\nbut to a degree I know it is the same with them all  they are all\\nknocked about and exposed to every climate and every weather\\ntill they are not fit to be seen  It is a pity they are not knocked\\non the head at once before they reach Admiral Baldwins age\\n\\nNay Sir Walter cried Mrs Clay this is being severe indeed\\nHave a little mercy on the poor men  We are not all born to be handsome\\nThe sea is no beautifier certainly sailors do grow old betimes\\nI have observed it they soon lose the look of youth  But then\\nis not it the same with many other professions perhaps most other\\nSoldiers in active service are not at all better off  and even in\\nthe quieter professions there is a toil and a labour of the mind\\nif not of the body which seldom leaves a mans looks to the natural\\neffect of time  The lawyer plods quite careworn the physician\\nis up at all hours and travelling in all weather and even\\nthe clergyman she stopt a moment to consider what might\\ndo for the clergymanand even the clergyman you know is obliged\\nto go into infected rooms and expose his health and looks to\\nall the injury of a poisonous atmosphere  In fact as I have\\nlong been convinced though every profession is necessary and honourable\\nin its turn it is only the lot of those who are not obliged to follow any\\nwho can live in a regular way in the country choosing their own hours\\nfollowing their own pursuits and living on their own property\\nwithout the torment of trying for more it is only their lot I say\\nto hold the blessings of health and a good appearance to the utmost\\nI know no other set of men but what lose something of their personableness\\nwhen they cease to be quite young\\n\\nIt seemed as if Mr Shepherd in this anxiety to bespeak\\nSir Walters good will towards a naval officer as tenant\\nhad been gifted with foresight for the very first application\\nfor the house was from an Admiral Croft with whom he shortly afterwards\\nfell into company in attending the quarter sessions at Taunton and indeed\\nhe had received a hint of the Admiral from a London correspondent\\nBy the report which he hastened over to Kellynch to make\\nAdmiral Croft was a native of Somersetshire who having acquired\\na very handsome fortune was wishing to settle in his own country\\nand had come down to Taunton in order to look at some advertised places\\nin that immediate neighbourhood which however had not suited him\\nthat accidentally hearingit was just as he had foretold\\nMr Shepherd observed Sir Walters concerns could not be kept a secret\\naccidentally hearing of the possibility of Kellynch Hall being to let\\nand understanding his Mr Shepherds connection with the owner\\nhe had introduced himself to him in order to make particular inquiries\\nand had in the course of a pretty long conference expressed as strong\\nan inclination for the place as a man who knew it only by description\\ncould feel and given Mr Shepherd in his explicit account of himself\\nevery proof of his being a most responsible eligible tenant\\n\\nAnd who is Admiral Croft was Sir Walters cold suspicious inquiry\\n\\nMr Shepherd answered for his being of a gentlemans family\\nand mentioned a place and Anne after the little pause which followed\\nadded\\n\\nHe is a rear admiral of the white  He was in the Trafalgar action\\nand has been in the East Indies since he was stationed there\\nI believe several years\\n\\nThen I take it for granted observed Sir Walter that his face\\nis about as orange as the cuffs and capes of my livery\\n\\nMr Shepherd hastened to assure him that Admiral Croft was a very hale\\nhearty welllooking man a little weatherbeaten to be sure\\nbut not much and quite the gentleman in all his notions and behaviour\\nnot likely to make the smallest difficulty about terms only wanted\\na comfortable home and to get into it as soon as possible\\nknew he must pay for his convenience knew what rent a readyfurnished\\nhouse of that consequence might fetch should not have been surprised\\nif Sir Walter had asked more had inquired about the manor\\nwould be glad of the deputation certainly but made no great point of it\\nsaid he sometimes took out a gun but never killed quite the gentleman\\n\\nMr Shepherd was eloquent on the subject pointing out all\\nthe circumstances of the Admirals family which made him\\npeculiarly desirable as a tenant  He was a married man\\nand without children the very state to be wished for  A house was\\nnever taken good care of Mr Shepherd observed without a lady\\nhe did not know whether furniture might not be in danger of suffering\\nas much where there was no lady as where there were many children\\nA lady without a family was the very best preserver of furniture\\nin the world  He had seen Mrs Croft too she was at Taunton\\nwith the admiral and had been present almost all the time they were\\ntalking the matter over\\n\\nAnd a very wellspoken genteel shrewd lady she seemed to be\\ncontinued he asked more questions about the house and terms\\nand taxes than the Admiral himself and seemed more conversant\\nwith business and moreover Sir Walter I found she was not quite\\nunconnected in this country any more than her husband that is to say\\nshe is sister to a gentleman who did live amongst us once\\nshe told me so herself  sister to the gentleman who lived\\na few years back at Monkford  Bless me what was his name\\nAt this moment I cannot recollect his name though I have heard it so lately\\nPenelope my dear can you help me to the name of the gentleman\\nwho lived at Monkford  Mrs Crofts brother\\n\\nBut Mrs Clay was talking so eagerly with Miss Elliot that she did not\\nhear the appeal\\n\\nI have no conception whom you can mean Shepherd I remember\\nno gentleman resident at Monkford since the time of old Governor Trent\\n\\nBless me how very odd  I shall forget my own name soon I suppose\\nA name that I am so very well acquainted with knew the gentleman\\nso well by sight seen him a hundred times came to consult me once\\nI remember about a trespass of one of his neighbours farmers man\\nbreaking into his orchard wall torn down apples stolen\\ncaught in the fact and afterwards contrary to my judgement\\nsubmitted to an amicable compromise  Very odd indeed\\n\\nAfter waiting another moment\\n\\nYou mean Mr Wentworth I suppose said Anne\\n\\nMr Shepherd was all gratitude\\n\\nWentworth was the very name  Mr Wentworth was the very man\\nHe had the curacy of Monkford you know Sir Walter some time back\\nfor two or three years  Came there about the year 5 I take it\\nYou remember him I am sure\\n\\nWentworth  Oh ayMr Wentworth the curate of Monkford\\nYou misled me by the term gentleman  I thought you were speaking of\\nsome man of property  Mr Wentworth was nobody I remember\\nquite unconnected nothing to do with the Strafford family\\nOne wonders how the names of many of our nobility become so common\\n\\nAs Mr Shepherd perceived that this connexion of the Crofts did them\\nno service with Sir Walter he mentioned it no more returning\\nwith all his zeal to dwell on the circumstances more indisputably\\nin their favour their age and number and fortune the high idea\\nthey had formed of Kellynch Hall and extreme solicitude for\\nthe advantage of renting it making it appear as if they ranked\\nnothing beyond the happiness of being the tenants of Sir Walter Elliot\\nan extraordinary taste certainly could they have been supposed in\\nthe secret of Sir Walters estimate of the dues of a tenant\\n\\nIt succeeded however and though Sir Walter must ever look with\\nan evil eye on anyone intending to inhabit that house and think them\\ninfinitely too well off in being permitted to rent it on the highest terms\\nhe was talked into allowing Mr Shepherd to proceed in the treaty\\nand authorising him to wait on Admiral Croft who still remained\\nat Taunton and fix a day for the house being seen\\n\\nSir Walter was not very wise but still he had experience enough\\nof the world to feel that a more unobjectionable tenant\\nin all essentials than Admiral Croft bid fair to be could hardly offer\\nSo far went his understanding and his vanity supplied a little\\nadditional soothing in the Admirals situation in life which was just\\nhigh enough and not too high  I have let my house to Admiral Croft\\nwould sound extremely well very much better than to any mere Mr\\na Mr save perhaps some half dozen in the nation always needs\\na note of explanation  An admiral speaks his own consequence\\nand at the same time can never make a baronet look small\\nIn all their dealings and intercourse Sir Walter Elliot must ever\\nhave the precedence\\n\\nNothing could be done without a reference to Elizabeth\\nbut her inclination was growing so strong for a removal\\nthat she was happy to have it fixed and expedited by a tenant at hand\\nand not a word to suspend decision was uttered by her\\n\\nMr Shepherd was completely empowered to act and no sooner had\\nsuch an end been reached than Anne who had been a most attentive listener\\nto the whole left the room to seek the comfort of cool air for her\\nflushed cheeks and as she walked along a favourite grove said\\nwith a gentle sigh A few months more and he perhaps\\nmay be walking here\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 4\\n\\n\\nHe was not Mr Wentworth the former curate of Monkford\\nhowever suspicious appearances may be but a Captain Frederick Wentworth\\nhis brother who being made commander in consequence of the action\\noff St Domingo and not immediately employed had come into Somersetshire\\nin the summer of 1806 and having no parent living found a home\\nfor half a year at Monkford  He was at that time a remarkably fine\\nyoung man with a great deal of intelligence spirit and brilliancy\\nand Anne an extremely pretty girl with gentleness modesty taste\\nand feeling  Half the sum of attraction on either side might have\\nbeen enough for he had nothing to do and she had hardly anybody to love\\nbut the encounter of such lavish recommendations could not fail\\nThey were gradually acquainted and when acquainted rapidly and\\ndeeply in love  It would be difficult to say which had seen\\nhighest perfection in the other or which had been the happiest\\nshe in receiving his declarations and proposals or he in\\nhaving them accepted\\n\\nA short period of exquisite felicity followed and but a short one\\nTroubles soon arose  Sir Walter on being applied to without actually\\nwithholding his consent or saying it should never be gave it all\\nthe negative of great astonishment great coldness great silence\\nand a professed resolution of doing nothing for his daughter\\nHe thought it a very degrading alliance and Lady Russell though with\\nmore tempered and pardonable pride received it as a most unfortunate one\\n\\nAnne Elliot with all her claims of birth beauty and mind\\nto throw herself away at nineteen involve herself at nineteen\\nin an engagement with a young man who had nothing but himself\\nto recommend him and no hopes of attaining affluence but in the chances\\nof a most uncertain profession and no connexions to secure\\neven his farther rise in the profession would be indeed a throwing away\\nwhich she grieved to think of  Anne Elliot so young known to so few\\nto be snatched off by a stranger without alliance or fortune\\nor rather sunk by him into a state of most wearing anxious\\nyouthkilling dependence  It must not be if by any fair interference\\nof friendship any representations from one who had almost a mothers love\\nand mothers rights it would be prevented\\n\\nCaptain Wentworth had no fortune  He had been lucky in his profession\\nbut spending freely what had come freely had realized nothing\\nBut he was confident that he should soon be rich\\nfull of life and ardour he knew that he should soon have a ship\\nand soon be on a station that would lead to everything he wanted\\nHe had always been lucky he knew he should be so still\\nSuch confidence powerful in its own warmth and bewitching in\\nthe wit which often expressed it must have been enough for Anne\\nbut Lady Russell saw it very differently  His sanguine temper\\nand fearlessness of mind operated very differently on her\\nShe saw in it but an aggravation of the evil  It only added a\\ndangerous character to himself  He was brilliant he was headstrong\\nLady Russell had little taste for wit and of anything approaching\\nto imprudence a horror  She deprecated the connexion in every light\\n\\nSuch opposition as these feelings produced was more than\\nAnne could combat  Young and gentle as she was it might yet\\nhave been possible to withstand her fathers illwill\\nthough unsoftened by one kind word or look on the part of her sister\\nbut Lady Russell whom she had always loved and relied on could not\\nwith such steadiness of opinion and such tenderness of manner\\nbe continually advising her in vain  She was persuaded to believe\\nthe engagement a wrong thing  indiscreet improper hardly capable\\nof success and not deserving it  But it was not a merely selfish caution\\nunder which she acted in putting an end to it  Had she not\\nimagined herself consulting his good even more than her own\\nshe could hardly have given him up  The belief of being prudent\\nand selfdenying principally for his advantage was her chief consolation\\nunder the misery of a parting a final parting and every consolation\\nwas required for she had to encounter all the additional pain of opinions\\non his side totally unconvinced and unbending and of his feeling himself\\nill used by so forced a relinquishment  He had left the country\\nin consequence\\n\\nA few months had seen the beginning and the end of their acquaintance\\nbut not with a few months ended Annes share of suffering from it\\nHer attachment and regrets had for a long time clouded every\\nenjoyment of youth and an early loss of bloom and spirits\\nhad been their lasting effect\\n\\nMore than seven years were gone since this little history\\nof sorrowful interest had reached its close and time had\\nsoftened down much perhaps nearly all of peculiar attachment to him\\nbut she had been too dependent on time alone no aid had been given\\nin change of place except in one visit to Bath soon after the rupture\\nor in any novelty or enlargement of society  No one had ever\\ncome within the Kellynch circle who could bear a comparison with\\nFrederick Wentworth as he stood in her memory  No second attachment\\nthe only thoroughly natural happy and sufficient cure\\nat her time of life had been possible to the nice tone of her mind\\nthe fastidiousness of her taste in the small limits of the society\\naround them  She had been solicited when about twoandtwenty\\nto change her name by the young man who not long afterwards found\\na more willing mind in her younger sister and Lady Russell had\\nlamented her refusal for Charles Musgrove was the eldest son of a man\\nwhose landed property and general importance were second in that country\\nonly to Sir Walters and of good character and appearance\\nand however Lady Russell might have asked yet for something more\\nwhile Anne was nineteen she would have rejoiced to see her at twentytwo\\nso respectably removed from the partialities and injustice of\\nher fathers house and settled so permanently near herself\\nBut in this case Anne had left nothing for advice to do\\nand though Lady Russell as satisfied as ever with her own discretion\\nnever wished the past undone she began now to have the anxiety\\nwhich borders on hopelessness for Annes being tempted by some man\\nof talents and independence to enter a state for which she held her\\nto be peculiarly fitted by her warm affections and domestic habits\\n\\nThey knew not each others opinion either its constancy or its change\\non the one leading point of Annes conduct for the subject was never\\nalluded to but Anne at sevenandtwenty thought very differently\\nfrom what she had been made to think at nineteen  She did not blame\\nLady Russell she did not blame herself for having been guided by her\\nbut she felt that were any young person in similar circumstances\\nto apply to her for counsel they would never receive any of such\\ncertain immediate wretchedness such uncertain future good\\nShe was persuaded that under every disadvantage of disapprobation at home\\nand every anxiety attending his profession all their probable fears\\ndelays and disappointments she should yet have been a happier woman\\nin maintaining the engagement than she had been in the sacrifice of it\\nand this she fully believed had the usual share had even more than\\nthe usual share of all such solicitudes and suspense been theirs\\nwithout reference to the actual results of their case which\\nas it happened would have bestowed earlier prosperity than\\ncould be reasonably calculated on  All his sanguine expectations\\nall his confidence had been justified  His genius and ardour\\nhad seemed to foresee and to command his prosperous path\\nHe had very soon after their engagement ceased got employ\\nand all that he had told her would follow had taken place\\nHe had distinguished himself and early gained the other step in rank\\nand must now by successive captures have made a handsome fortune\\nShe had only navy lists and newspapers for her authority\\nbut she could not doubt his being rich and in favour of his constancy\\nshe had no reason to believe him married\\n\\nHow eloquent could Anne Elliot have been how eloquent at least\\nwere her wishes on the side of early warm attachment and a cheerful\\nconfidence in futurity against that overanxious caution which\\nseems to insult exertion and distrust Providence  She had been forced\\ninto prudence in her youth she learned romance as she grew older\\nthe natural sequel of an unnatural beginning\\n\\nWith all these circumstances recollections and feelings\\nshe could not hear that Captain Wentworths sister was likely\\nto live at Kellynch without a revival of former pain and many a stroll\\nand many a sigh were necessary to dispel the agitation of the idea\\nShe often told herself it was folly before she could harden her nerves\\nsufficiently to feel the continual discussion of the Crofts\\nand their business no evil  She was assisted however by that\\nperfect indifference and apparent unconsciousness among the only three\\nof her own friends in the secret of the past which seemed almost to deny\\nany recollection of it  She could do justice to the superiority\\nof Lady Russells motives in this over those of her father and Elizabeth\\nshe could honour all the better feelings of her calmness\\nbut the general air of oblivion among them was highly important\\nfrom whatever it sprung and in the event of Admiral Crofts really\\ntaking Kellynch Hall she rejoiced anew over the conviction which\\nhad always been most grateful to her of the past being known to\\nthose three only among her connexions by whom no syllable\\nshe believed would ever be whispered and in the trust that among his\\nthe brother only with whom he had been residing had received\\nany information of their shortlived engagement  That brother had been\\nlong removed from the country and being a sensible man and moreover\\na single man at the time she had a fond dependence on no human creatures\\nhaving heard of it from him\\n\\nThe sister Mrs Croft had then been out of England accompanying\\nher husband on a foreign station and her own sister Mary\\nhad been at school while it all occurred and never admitted by\\nthe pride of some and the delicacy of others to the smallest knowledge\\nof it afterwards\\n\\nWith these supports she hoped that the acquaintance between herself\\nand the Crofts which with Lady Russell still resident in Kellynch\\nand Mary fixed only three miles off must be anticipated\\nneed not involve any particular awkwardness\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 5\\n\\n\\nOn the morning appointed for Admiral and Mrs Crofts seeing Kellynch Hall\\nAnne found it most natural to take her almost daily walk to Lady Russells\\nand keep out of the way till all was over when she found it most natural\\nto be sorry that she had missed the opportunity of seeing them\\n\\nThis meeting of the two parties proved highly satisfactory\\nand decided the whole business at once  Each lady was previously\\nwell disposed for an agreement and saw nothing therefore\\nbut good manners in the other and with regard to the gentlemen\\nthere was such an hearty good humour such an open trusting liberality\\non the Admirals side as could not but influence Sir Walter\\nwho had besides been flattered into his very best and most polished\\nbehaviour by Mr Shepherds assurances of his being known by report\\nto the Admiral as a model of good breeding\\n\\nThe house and grounds and furniture were approved the Crofts\\nwere approved terms time every thing and every body was right\\nand Mr Shepherds clerks were set to work without there having been\\na single preliminary difference to modify of all that\\nThis indenture sheweth\\n\\nSir Walter without hesitation declared the Admiral to be\\nthe bestlooking sailor he had ever met with and went so far as to say\\nthat if his own man might have had the arranging of his hair\\nhe should not be ashamed of being seen with him any where\\nand the Admiral with sympathetic cordiality observed to his wife\\nas they drove back through the park I thought we should soon\\ncome to a deal my dear in spite of what they told us at Taunton\\nThe Baronet will never set the Thames on fire but there seems to be\\nno harm in him  reciprocal compliments which would have been\\nesteemed about equal\\n\\nThe Crofts were to have possession at Michaelmas and as Sir Walter\\nproposed removing to Bath in the course of the preceding month\\nthere was no time to be lost in making every dependent arrangement\\n\\nLady Russell convinced that Anne would not be allowed to be of any use\\nor any importance in the choice of the house which they were\\ngoing to secure was very unwilling to have her hurried away so soon\\nand wanted to make it possible for her to stay behind till she might\\nconvey her to Bath herself after Christmas but having engagements\\nof her own which must take her from Kellynch for several weeks\\nshe was unable to give the full invitation she wished and Anne\\nthough dreading the possible heats of September in all the white glare\\nof Bath and grieving to forego all the influence so sweet and so sad\\nof the autumnal months in the country did not think that\\neverything considered she wished to remain  It would be most right\\nand most wise and therefore must involve least suffering\\nto go with the others\\n\\nSomething occurred however to give her a different duty\\nMary often a little unwell and always thinking a great deal\\nof her own complaints and always in the habit of claiming Anne\\nwhen anything was the matter was indisposed and foreseeing\\nthat she should not have a days health all the autumn entreated\\nor rather required her for it was hardly entreaty to come to\\nUppercross Cottage and bear her company as long as she should want her\\ninstead of going to Bath\\n\\nI cannot possibly do without Anne was Marys reasoning\\nand Elizabeths reply was Then I am sure Anne had better stay\\nfor nobody will want her in Bath\\n\\nTo be claimed as a good though in an improper style is at least\\nbetter than being rejected as no good at all and Anne glad to\\nbe thought of some use glad to have anything marked out as a duty\\nand certainly not sorry to have the scene of it in the country\\nand her own dear country readily agreed to stay\\n\\nThis invitation of Marys removed all Lady Russells difficulties\\nand it was consequently soon settled that Anne should not go to Bath\\ntill Lady Russell took her and that all the intervening time\\nshould be divided between Uppercross Cottage and Kellynch Lodge\\n\\nSo far all was perfectly right but Lady Russell was almost startled\\nby the wrong of one part of the Kellynch Hall plan when it burst on her\\nwhich was Mrs Clays being engaged to go to Bath with Sir Walter\\nand Elizabeth as a most important and valuable assistant to the latter\\nin all the business before her  Lady Russell was extremely sorry\\nthat such a measure should have been resorted to at all wondered\\ngrieved and feared and the affront it contained to Anne\\nin Mrs Clays being of so much use while Anne could be of none\\nwas a very sore aggravation\\n\\nAnne herself was become hardened to such affronts but she felt\\nthe imprudence of the arrangement quite as keenly as Lady Russell\\nWith a great deal of quiet observation and a knowledge\\nwhich she often wished less of her fathers character she was\\nsensible that results the most serious to his family from the intimacy\\nwere more than possible  She did not imagine that her father\\nhad at present an idea of the kind  Mrs Clay had freckles\\nand a projecting tooth and a clumsy wrist which he was continually\\nmaking severe remarks upon in her absence but she was young\\nand certainly altogether welllooking and possessed in an acute mind\\nand assiduous pleasing manners infinitely more dangerous attractions\\nthan any merely personal might have been  Anne was so impressed\\nby the degree of their danger that she could not excuse herself\\nfrom trying to make it perceptible to her sister  She had little hope\\nof success but Elizabeth who in the event of such a reverse would be\\nso much more to be pitied than herself should never she thought\\nhave reason to reproach her for giving no warning\\n\\nShe spoke and seemed only to offend  Elizabeth could not conceive\\nhow such an absurd suspicion should occur to her and indignantly\\nanswered for each partys perfectly knowing their situation\\n\\nMrs Clay said she warmly never forgets who she is\\nand as I am rather better acquainted with her sentiments than you can be\\nI can assure you that upon the subject of marriage they are\\nparticularly nice and that she reprobates all inequality of condition\\nand rank more strongly than most people  And as to my father\\nI really should not have thought that he who has kept himself single\\nso long for our sakes need be suspected now  If Mrs Clay were\\na very beautiful woman I grant you it might be wrong to have her\\nso much with me not that anything in the world I am sure\\nwould induce my father to make a degrading match but he might\\nbe rendered unhappy  But poor Mrs Clay who with all her merits\\ncan never have been reckoned tolerably pretty I really think poor\\nMrs Clay may be staying here in perfect safety  One would imagine\\nyou had never heard my father speak of her personal misfortunes\\nthough I know you must fifty times  That tooth of hers\\nand those freckles  Freckles do not disgust me so very much\\nas they do him  I have known a face not materially disfigured by a few\\nbut he abominates them  You must have heard him notice\\nMrs Clays freckles\\n\\nThere is hardly any personal defect replied Anne\\nwhich an agreeable manner might not gradually reconcile one to\\n\\nI think very differently answered Elizabeth shortly\\nan agreeable manner may set off handsome features but can never\\nalter plain ones  However at any rate as I have a great deal more\\nat stake on this point than anybody else can have I think it\\nrather unnecessary in you to be advising me\\n\\nAnne had done glad that it was over and not absolutely hopeless\\nof doing good  Elizabeth though resenting the suspicion\\nmight yet be made observant by it\\n\\nThe last office of the four carriagehorses was to draw Sir Walter\\nMiss Elliot and Mrs Clay to Bath  The party drove off in very good spirits\\nSir Walter prepared with condescending bows for all the afflicted\\ntenantry and cottagers who might have had a hint to show themselves\\nand Anne walked up at the same time in a sort of desolate tranquillity\\nto the Lodge where she was to spend the first week\\n\\nHer friend was not in better spirits than herself Lady Russell felt this\\nbreakup of the family exceedingly  Their respectability was\\nas dear to her as her own and a daily intercourse had become\\nprecious by habit  It was painful to look upon their deserted grounds\\nand still worse to anticipate the new hands they were to fall into\\nand to escape the solitariness and the melancholy of so altered a village\\nand be out of the way when Admiral and Mrs Croft first arrived\\nshe had determined to make her own absence from home begin\\nwhen she must give up Anne  Accordingly their removal was made together\\nand Anne was set down at Uppercross Cottage in the first stage\\nof Lady Russells journey\\n\\nUppercross was a moderatesized village which a few years back\\nhad been completely in the old English style containing only\\ntwo houses superior in appearance to those of the yeomen and labourers\\nthe mansion of the squire with its high walls great gates and old trees\\nsubstantial and unmodernized and the compact tight parsonage\\nenclosed in its own neat garden with a vine and a peartree\\ntrained round its casements but upon the marriage of the young squire\\nit had received the improvement of a farmhouse elevated into a cottage\\nfor his residence and Uppercross Cottage with its veranda\\nFrench windows and other prettiness was quite as likely to catch\\nthe travellers eye as the more consistent and considerable aspect\\nand premises of the Great House about a quarter of a mile farther on\\n\\nHere Anne had often been staying  She knew the ways of Uppercross\\nas well as those of Kellynch  The two families were so continually meeting\\nso much in the habit of running in and out of each others house\\nat all hours that it was rather a surprise to her to find Mary alone\\nbut being alone her being unwell and out of spirits was almost\\na matter of course  Though better endowed than the elder sister\\nMary had not Annes understanding nor temper  While well and happy\\nand properly attended to she had great good humour and excellent spirits\\nbut any indisposition sunk her completely  She had no resources\\nfor solitude and inheriting a considerable share of the Elliot\\nselfimportance was very prone to add to every other distress\\nthat of fancying herself neglected and illused  In person she was\\ninferior to both sisters and had even in her bloom only reached\\nthe dignity of being a fine girl  She was now lying on the faded sofa\\nof the pretty little drawingroom the once elegant furniture of which\\nhad been gradually growing shabby under the influence of four summers\\nand two children and on Annes appearing greeted her with\\n\\nSo you are come at last  I began to think I should never see you\\nI am so ill I can hardly speak  I have not seen a creature\\nthe whole morning\\n\\nI am sorry to find you unwell replied Anne  You sent me\\nsuch a good account of yourself on Thursday\\n\\nYes I made the best of it I always do  but I was very far from well\\nat the time and I do not think I ever was so ill in my life\\nas I have been all this morning  very unfit to be left alone I am sure\\nSuppose I were to be seized of a sudden in some dreadful way\\nand not able to ring the bell  So Lady Russell would not get out\\nI do not think she has been in this house three times this summer\\n\\nAnne said what was proper and enquired after her husband\\nOh Charles is out shooting  I have not seen him since seven oclock\\nHe would go though I told him how ill I was  He said he should not\\nstay out long but he has never come back and now it is almost one\\nI assure you I have not seen a soul this whole long morning\\n\\nYou have had your little boys with you\\n\\nYes as long as I could bear their noise but they are so unmanageable\\nthat they do me more harm than good  Little Charles does not mind\\na word I say and Walter is growing quite as bad\\n\\nWell you will soon be better now replied Anne cheerfully\\nYou know I always cure you when I come  How are your neighbours\\nat the Great House\\n\\nI can give you no account of them  I have not seen one of them today\\nexcept Mr Musgrove who just stopped and spoke through the window\\nbut without getting off his horse and though I told him how ill I was\\nnot one of them have been near me  It did not happen to suit\\nthe Miss Musgroves I suppose and they never put themselves\\nout of their way\\n\\nYou will see them yet perhaps before the morning is gone\\nIt is early\\n\\nI never want them I assure you  They talk and laugh a great deal\\ntoo much for me  Oh Anne I am so very unwell  It was quite unkind\\nof you not to come on Thursday\\n\\nMy dear Mary recollect what a comfortable account you sent me of yourself\\nYou wrote in the cheerfullest manner and said you were perfectly well\\nand in no hurry for me and that being the case you must be aware\\nthat my wish would be to remain with Lady Russell to the last\\nand besides what I felt on her account I have really been so busy\\nhave had so much to do that I could not very conveniently have\\nleft Kellynch sooner\\n\\nDear me what can you possibly have to do\\n\\nA great many things I assure you  More than I can recollect\\nin a moment but I can tell you some  I have been making\\na duplicate of the catalogue of my fathers books and pictures\\nI have been several times in the garden with Mackenzie\\ntrying to understand and make him understand which of Elizabeths plants\\nare for Lady Russell  I have had all my own little concerns\\nto arrange books and music to divide and all my trunks to repack\\nfrom not having understood in time what was intended as to the waggons\\nand one thing I have had to do Mary of a more trying nature\\ngoing to almost every house in the parish as a sort of takeleave\\nI was told that they wished it  But all these things took up\\na great deal of time\\n\\nOh well and after a moments pause but you have never asked me\\none word about our dinner at the Pooles yesterday\\n\\nDid you go then  I have made no enquiries because I concluded\\nyou must have been obliged to give up the party\\n\\nOh yes I went  I was very well yesterday nothing at all\\nthe matter with me till this morning  It would have been strange\\nif I had not gone\\n\\nI am very glad you were well enough and I hope you had a pleasant party\\n\\nNothing remarkable  One always knows beforehand what the dinner will be\\nand who will be there and it is so very uncomfortable not having\\na carriage of ones own  Mr and Mrs Musgrove took me and we were\\nso crowded  They are both so very large and take up so much room\\nand Mr Musgrove always sits forward  So there was I crowded into\\nthe back seat with Henrietta and Louise and I think it very likely\\nthat my illness today may be owing to it\\n\\nA little further perseverance in patience and forced cheerfulness\\non Annes side produced nearly a cure on Marys  She could soon\\nsit upright on the sofa and began to hope she might be able\\nto leave it by dinnertime  Then forgetting to think of it\\nshe was at the other end of the room beautifying a nosegay\\nthen she ate her cold meat and then she was well enough\\nto propose a little walk\\n\\nWhere shall we go said she when they were ready  I suppose\\nyou will not like to call at the Great House before they have\\nbeen to see you\\n\\nI have not the smallest objection on that account replied Anne\\nI should never think of standing on such ceremony with people I know\\nso well as Mrs and the Miss Musgroves\\n\\nOh but they ought to call upon you as soon as possible\\nThey ought to feel what is due to you as my sister  However\\nwe may as well go and sit with them a little  while and when we\\nhave that over we can enjoy our walk\\n\\nAnne had always thought such a style of intercourse highly imprudent\\nbut she had ceased to endeavour to check it from believing that\\nthough there were on each side continual subjects of offence\\nneither family could now do without it  To the Great House accordingly\\nthey went to sit the full half hour in the oldfashioned square parlour\\nwith a small carpet and shining floor to which the present\\ndaughters of the house were gradually giving the proper air of confusion\\nby a grand pianoforte and a harp flowerstands and little tables\\nplaced in every direction  Oh could the originals of the portraits\\nagainst the wainscot could the gentlemen in brown velvet and\\nthe ladies in blue satin have seen what was going on have been conscious\\nof such an overthrow of all order and neatness  The portraits themselves\\nseemed to be staring in astonishment\\n\\nThe Musgroves like their houses were in a state of alteration\\nperhaps of improvement  The father and mother were in the old\\nEnglish style and the young people in the new  Mr and Mrs Musgrove\\nwere a very good sort of people friendly and hospitable\\nnot much educated and not at all elegant  Their children had\\nmore modern minds and manners  There was a numerous family\\nbut the only two grown up excepting Charles were Henrietta and Louisa\\nyoung ladies of nineteen and twenty who had brought from school at Exeter\\nall the usual stock of accomplishments and were now like thousands\\nof other young ladies living to be fashionable happy and merry\\nTheir dress had every advantage their faces were rather pretty\\ntheir spirits extremely good their manner unembarrassed and pleasant\\nthey were of consequence at home and favourites abroad\\nAnne always contemplated them as some of the happiest creatures\\nof her acquaintance but still saved as we all are by some\\ncomfortable feeling of superiority from wishing for the possibility\\nof exchange she would not have given up her own more elegant\\nand cultivated mind for all their enjoyments and envied them nothing\\nbut that seemingly perfect good understanding and agreement together\\nthat goodhumoured mutual affection of which she had known\\nso little herself with either of her sisters\\n\\nThey were received with great cordiality  Nothing seemed amiss\\non the side of the Great House family which was generally\\nas Anne very well knew the least to blame  The half hour was\\nchatted away pleasantly enough and she was not at all surprised\\nat the end of it to have their walking party joined by both\\nthe Miss Musgroves at Marys particular invitation\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 6\\n\\n\\nAnne had not wanted this visit to Uppercross to learn that a removal\\nfrom one set of people to another though at a distance of only three miles\\nwill often include a total change of conversation opinion and idea\\nShe had never been staying there before without being struck by it\\nor without wishing that other Elliots could have her advantage\\nin seeing how unknown or unconsidered there were the affairs\\nwhich at Kellynch Hall were treated as of such general publicity\\nand pervading interest yet with all this experience she believed\\nshe must now submit to feel that another lesson in the art of knowing\\nour own nothingness beyond our own circle was become necessary for her\\nfor certainly coming as she did with a heart full of the subject\\nwhich had been completely occupying both houses in Kellynch for many weeks\\nshe had expected rather more curiosity and sympathy than she found\\nin the separate but very similar remark of Mr and Mrs Musgrove\\nSo Miss Anne Sir Walter and your sister are gone and what part of Bath\\ndo you think they will settle in and this without much\\nwaiting for an answer or in the young ladies addition of\\nI hope we shall be in Bath in the winter but remember papa\\nif we do go we must be in a good situation  none of your\\nQueen Squares for us or in the anxious supplement from Mary of\\nUpon my word I shall be pretty well off when you are all gone away\\nto be happy at Bath\\n\\nShe could only resolve to avoid such selfdelusion in future\\nand think with heightened gratitude of the extraordinary blessing\\nof having one such truly sympathising friend as Lady Russell\\n\\nThe Mr Musgroves had their own game to guard and to destroy\\ntheir own horses dogs and newspapers to engage them and the females\\nwere fully occupied in all the other common subjects of housekeeping\\nneighbours dress dancing and music  She acknowledged it to be\\nvery fitting that every little social commonwealth should dictate\\nits own matters of discourse and hoped ere long to become\\na not unworthy member of the one she was now transplanted into\\nWith the prospect of spending at least two months at Uppercross\\nit was highly incumbent on her to clothe her imagination her memory\\nand all her ideas in as much of Uppercross as possible\\n\\nShe had no dread of these two months  Mary was not so repulsive\\nand unsisterly as Elizabeth nor so inaccessible to all influence of hers\\nneither was there anything among the other component parts\\nof the cottage inimical to comfort  She was always on friendly terms\\nwith her brotherinlaw and in the children who loved her nearly as well\\nand respected her a great deal more than their mother she had\\nan object of interest amusement and wholesome exertion\\n\\nCharles Musgrove was civil and agreeable in sense and temper he was\\nundoubtedly superior to his wife but not of powers or conversation\\nor grace to make the past as they were connected together\\nat all a dangerous contemplation though at the same time\\nAnne could believe with Lady Russell that a more equal match\\nmight have greatly improved him and that a woman of real understanding\\nmight have given more consequence to his character and more usefulness\\nrationality and elegance to his habits and pursuits  As it was\\nhe did nothing with much zeal but sport and his time was otherwise\\ntrifled away without benefit from books or anything else\\nHe had very good spirits which never seemed much affected by\\nhis wifes occasional lowness bore with her unreasonableness\\nsometimes to Annes admiration and upon the whole though there was\\nvery often a little disagreement in which she had sometimes more share\\nthan she wished being appealed to by both parties they might pass\\nfor a happy couple  They were always perfectly agreed in the want\\nof more money and a strong inclination for a handsome present\\nfrom his father but here as on most topics he had the superiority\\nfor while Mary thought it a great shame that such a present was not made\\nhe always contended for his fathers having many other uses for his money\\nand a right to spend it as he liked\\n\\nAs to the management of their children his theory was much better\\nthan his wifes and his practice not so bad  I could manage them\\nvery well if it were not for Marys interference was what\\nAnne often heard him say and had a good deal of faith in\\nbut when listening in turn to Marys reproach of Charles spoils\\nthe children so that I cannot get them into any order she never had\\nthe smallest temptation to say Very true\\n\\nOne of the least agreeable circumstances of her residence there\\nwas her being treated with too much confidence by all parties\\nand being too much in the secret of the complaints of each house\\nKnown to have some influence with her sister she was continually requested\\nor at least receiving hints to exert it beyond what was practicable\\nI wish you could persuade Mary not to be always fancying herself ill\\nwas Charless language and in an unhappy mood thus spoke Mary\\nI do believe if Charles were to see me dying he would not think\\nthere was anything the matter with me  I am sure Anne if you would\\nyou might persuade him that I really am very illa great deal worse\\nthan I ever own\\n\\nMarys declaration was I hate sending the children to the Great House\\nthough their grandmamma is always wanting to see them for she humours\\nand indulges them to such a degree and gives them so much trash\\nand sweet things that they are sure to come back sick and cross\\nfor the rest of the day  And Mrs Musgrove took the first opportunity\\nof being alone with Anne to say Oh Miss Anne I cannot help wishing\\nMrs Charles had a little of your method with those children\\nThey are quite different creatures with you  But to be sure\\nin general they are so spoilt  It is a pity you cannot put your sister\\nin the way of managing them  They are as fine healthy children\\nas ever were seen poor little dears without partiality\\nbut Mrs Charles knows no more how they should be treated\\nBless me how troublesome they are sometimes  I assure you Miss Anne\\nit prevents my wishing to see them at our house so often as\\nI otherwise should  I believe Mrs Charles is not quite pleased\\nwith my not inviting them oftener but you know it is very bad\\nto have children with one that one is obligated to be checking\\nevery moment dont do this and dont do that  or that one can\\nonly keep in tolerable order by more cake than is good for them\\n\\nShe had this communication moreover from Mary  Mrs Musgrove thinks\\nall her servants so steady that it would be high treason\\nto call it in question but I am sure without exaggeration\\nthat her upper housemaid and laundrymaid instead of being\\nin their business are gadding about the village all day long\\nI meet them wherever I go and I declare I never go twice into my nursery\\nwithout seeing something of them  If Jemima were not the trustiest\\nsteadiest creature in the world it would be enough to spoil her\\nfor she tells me they are always tempting her to take a walk with them\\nAnd on Mrs Musgroves side it was I make a rule of never interfering\\nin any of my daughterinlaws concerns for I know it would not do\\nbut I shall tell you Miss Anne because you may be able to set things\\nto rights that I have no very good opinion of Mrs Charless nurserymaid\\nI hear strange stories of her she is always upon the gad and from\\nmy own knowledge I can declare she is such a finedressing lady\\nthat she is enough to ruin any servants she comes near\\nMrs Charles quite swears by her I know but I just give you this hint\\nthat you may be upon the watch because if you see anything amiss\\nyou need not be afraid of mentioning it\\n\\nAgain it was Marys complaint that Mrs Musgrove was very apt\\nnot to give her the precedence that was her due when they dined\\nat the Great House with other families and she did not see any reason\\nwhy she was to be considered so much at home as to lose her place\\nAnd one day when Anne was walking with only the Musgroves one of them\\nafter talking of rank people of rank and jealousy of rank said\\nI have no scruple of observing to you how nonsensical some persons are\\nabout their place because all the world knows how easy and indifferent\\nyou are about it but I wish anybody could give Mary a hint that\\nit would be a great deal better if she were not so very tenacious\\nespecially if she would not be always putting herself forward to take\\nplace of mamma  Nobody doubts her right to have precedence of mamma\\nbut it would be more becoming in her not to be always insisting on it\\nIt is not that mamma cares about it the least in the world\\nbut I know it is taken notice of by many persons\\n\\nHow was Anne to set all these matters to rights  She could do little more\\nthan listen patiently soften every grievance and excuse each\\nto the other give them all hints of the forbearance necessary\\nbetween such near neighbours and make those hints broadest\\nwhich were meant for her sisters benefit\\n\\nIn all other respects her visit began and proceeded very well\\nHer own spirits improved by change of place and subject\\nby being removed three miles from Kellynch Marys ailments lessened\\nby having a constant companion and their daily intercourse\\nwith the other family since there was neither superior affection\\nconfidence nor employment in the cottage to be interrupted by it\\nwas rather an advantage  It was certainly carried nearly as far as possible\\nfor they met every morning and hardly ever spent an evening asunder\\nbut she believed they should not have done so well without the sight\\nof Mr and Mrs Musgroves respectable forms in the usual places\\nor without the talking laughing and singing of their daughters\\n\\nShe played a great deal better than either of the Miss Musgroves\\nbut having no voice no knowledge of the harp and no fond parents\\nto sit by and fancy themselves delighted her performance was\\nlittle thought of only out of civility or to refresh the others\\nas she was well aware  She knew that when she played she was\\ngiving pleasure only to herself but this was no new sensation\\nExcepting one short period of her life she had never since the age\\nof fourteen never since the loss of her dear mother known the happiness\\nof being listened to or encouraged by any just appreciation or real taste\\nIn music she had been always used to feel alone in the world\\nand Mr and Mrs Musgroves fond partiality for their own daughters\\nperformance and total indifference to any other persons\\ngave her much more pleasure for their sakes than mortification\\nfor her own\\n\\nThe party at the Great House was sometimes increased by other company\\nThe neighbourhood was not large but the Musgroves were visited\\nby everybody and had more dinnerparties and more callers\\nmore visitors by invitation and by chance than any other family\\nThere were more completely popular\\n\\nThe girls were wild for dancing and the evenings ended occasionally\\nin an unpremeditated little ball  There was a family of cousins\\nwithin a walk of Uppercross in less affluent circumstances\\nwho depended on the Musgroves for all their pleasures  they would come\\nat any time and help play at anything or dance anywhere and Anne\\nvery much preferring the office of musician to a more active post\\nplayed country dances to them by the hour together a kindness which\\nalways recommended her musical powers to the notice of Mr and Mrs Musgrove\\nmore than anything else and often drew this compliment\\nWell done Miss Anne very well done indeed  Lord bless me\\nhow those little fingers of yours fly about\\n\\nSo passed the first three weeks  Michaelmas came and now Annes heart\\nmust be in Kellynch again  A beloved home made over to others\\nall the precious rooms and furniture groves and prospects\\nbeginning to own other eyes and other limbs  She could not\\nthink of much else on the 29th of September and she had this\\nsympathetic touch in the evening from Mary who on having occasion\\nto note down the day of the month exclaimed Dear me is not this\\nthe day the Crofts were to come to Kellynch  I am glad I did not\\nthink of it before  How low it makes me\\n\\nThe Crofts took possession with true naval alertness and were\\nto be visited  Mary deplored the necessity for herself\\nNobody knew how much she should suffer  She should put it off\\nas long as she could but was not easy till she had talked Charles\\ninto driving her over on an early day and was in a very animated\\ncomfortable state of imaginary agitation when she came back\\nAnne had very sincerely rejoiced in there being no means of her going\\nShe wished however to see the Crofts and was glad to be within\\nwhen the visit was returned  They came  the master of the house\\nwas not at home but the two sisters were together and as it chanced\\nthat Mrs Croft fell to the share of Anne while the Admiral sat by Mary\\nand made himself very agreeable by his goodhumoured notice\\nof her little boys she was well able to watch for a likeness\\nand if it failed her in the features to catch it in the voice\\nor in the turn of sentiment and expression\\n\\nMrs Croft though neither tall nor fat had a squareness\\nuprightness and vigour of form which gave importance to her person\\nShe had bright dark eyes good teeth and altogether an agreeable face\\nthough her reddened and weatherbeaten complexion the consequence\\nof her having been almost as much at sea as her husband made her seem to\\nhave lived some years longer in the world than her real eightandthirty\\nHer manners were open easy and decided like one who had\\nno distrust of herself and no doubts of what to do without any\\napproach to coarseness however or any want of good humour\\nAnne gave her credit indeed for feelings of great consideration\\ntowards herself in all that related to Kellynch and it pleased her\\nespecially as she had satisfied herself in the very first half minute\\nin the instant even of introduction that there was not the smallest\\nsymptom of any knowledge or suspicion on Mrs Crofts side to give a bias\\nof any sort  She was quite easy on that head and consequently\\nfull of strength and courage till for a moment electrified by\\nMrs Crofts suddenly saying\\n\\nIt was you and not your sister I find that my brother had\\nthe pleasure of being acquainted with when he was in this country\\n\\nAnne hoped she had outlived the age of blushing but the age of emotion\\nshe certainly had not\\n\\nPerhaps you may not have heard that he is married added Mrs Croft\\n\\nShe could now answer as she ought and was happy to feel\\nwhen Mrs Crofts next words explained it to be Mr Wentworth\\nof whom she spoke that she had said nothing which might not do\\nfor either brother She immediately felt how reasonable it was\\nthat Mrs Croft should be thinking and speaking of Edward\\nand not of Frederick and with shame at her own forgetfulness\\napplied herself to the knowledge of their former neighbours\\npresent state with proper interest\\n\\nThe rest was all tranquillity till just as they were moving\\nshe heard the Admiral say to Mary\\n\\nWe are expecting a brother of Mrs Crofts here soon I dare say\\nyou know him by name\\n\\nHe was cut short by the eager attacks of the little boys\\nclinging to him like an old friend and declaring he should not go\\nand being too much engrossed by proposals of carrying them away\\nin his coat pockets c to have another moment for finishing\\nor recollecting what he had begun Anne was left to persuade herself\\nas well as she could that the same brother must still be in question\\nShe could not however reach such a degree of certainty\\nas not to be anxious to hear whether anything had been said on the subject\\nat the other house where the Crofts had previously been calling\\n\\nThe folks of the Great House were to spend the evening of this day\\nat the Cottage and it being now too late in the year for such visits\\nto be made on foot the coach was beginning to be listened for\\nwhen the youngest Miss Musgrove walked in  That she was coming\\nto apologize and that they should have to spend the evening by themselves\\nwas the first black idea and Mary was quite ready to be affronted\\nwhen Louisa made all right by saying that she only came on foot\\nto leave more room for the harp which was bringing in the carriage\\n\\nAnd I will tell you our reason she added and all about it\\nI am come on to give you notice that papa and mamma are\\nout of spirits this evening especially mamma she is thinking so much\\nof poor Richard  And we agreed it would be best to have the harp\\nfor it seems to amuse her more than the pianoforte  I will tell you\\nwhy she is out of spirits  When the Crofts called this morning\\nthey called here afterwards did not they they happened to say\\nthat her brother Captain Wentworth is just returned to England\\nor paid off or something and is coming to see them almost directly\\nand most unluckily it came into mammas head when they were gone\\nthat Wentworth or something very like it was the name of\\npoor Richards captain at one time I do not know when or where\\nbut a great while before he died poor fellow  And upon looking over\\nhis letters and things she found it was so and is perfectly sure\\nthat this must be the very man and her head is quite full of it\\nand of poor Richard  So we must be as merry as we can that she may not\\nbe dwelling upon such gloomy things\\n\\nThe real circumstances of this pathetic piece of family history were\\nthat the Musgroves had had the ill fortune of a very troublesome\\nhopeless son and the good fortune to lose him before he reached\\nhis twentieth year that he had been sent to sea because he was stupid\\nand unmanageable on shore that he had been very little cared for\\nat any time by his family though quite as much as he deserved\\nseldom heard of and scarcely at all regretted when the intelligence\\nof his death abroad had worked its way to Uppercross two years before\\n\\nHe had in fact though his sisters were now doing all they could for him\\nby calling him poor Richard been nothing better than a thickheaded\\nunfeeling unprofitable Dick Musgrove who had never done anything\\nto entitle himself to more than the abbreviation of his name\\nliving or dead\\n\\nHe had been several years at sea and had in the course of those removals\\nto which all midshipmen are liable and especially such midshipmen\\nas every captain wishes to get rid of been six months on board\\nCaptain Frederick Wentworths frigate the Laconia and from the Laconia\\nhe had under the influence of his captain written the only two letters\\nwhich his father and mother had ever received from him during the whole\\nof his absence that is to say the only two disinterested letters\\nall the rest had been mere applications for money\\n\\nIn each letter he had spoken well of his captain but yet\\nso little were they in the habit of attending to such matters\\nso unobservant and incurious were they as to the names of men or ships\\nthat it had made scarcely any impression at the time and that Mrs Musgrove\\nshould have been suddenly struck this very day with a recollection\\nof the name of Wentworth as connected with her son seemed one of those\\nextraordinary bursts of mind which do sometimes occur\\n\\nShe had gone to her letters and found it all as she supposed\\nand the reperusal of these letters after so long an interval\\nher poor son gone for ever and all the strength of his faults forgotten\\nhad affected her spirits exceedingly and thrown her into\\ngreater grief for him than she had know on first hearing of his death\\nMr Musgrove was in a lesser degree affected likewise and when\\nthey reached the cottage they were evidently in want first\\nof being listened to anew on this subject and afterwards\\nof all the relief which cheerful companions could give them\\n\\nTo hear them talking so much of Captain Wentworth repeating his name\\nso often puzzling over past years and at last ascertaining that it might\\nthat it probably would turn out to be the very same Captain Wentworth\\nwhom they recollected meeting once or twice after their coming back\\nfrom Cliftona very fine young manbut they could not say whether\\nit was seven or eight years ago was a new sort of trial to Annes nerves\\nShe found however that it was one to which she must inure herself\\nSince he actually was expected in the country she must teach herself\\nto be insensible on such points  And not only did it appear that\\nhe was expected and speedily but the Musgroves in their warm gratitude\\nfor the kindness he had shewn poor Dick and very high respect\\nfor his character stamped as it was by poor Dicks having been\\nsix months under his care and mentioning him in strong\\nthough not perfectly wellspelt praise as a fine dashing felow\\nonly two perticular about the schoolmaster were bent on\\nintroducing themselves and seeking his acquaintance as soon as\\nthey could hear of his arrival\\n\\nThe resolution of doing so helped to form the comfort of their evening\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 7\\n\\n\\nA very few days more and Captain Wentworth was known to be at Kellynch\\nand Mr Musgrove had called on him and come back warm in his praise\\nand he was engaged with the Crofts to dine at Uppercross\\nby the end of another week  It had been a great disappointment\\nto Mr Musgrove to find that no earlier day could be fixed\\nso impatient was he to shew his gratitude by seeing Captain Wentworth\\nunder his own roof and welcoming him to all that was strongest\\nand best in his cellars  But a week must pass only a week\\nin Annes reckoning and then she supposed they must meet\\nand soon she began to wish that she could feel secure even for a week\\n\\nCaptain Wentworth made a very early return to Mr Musgroves civility\\nand she was all but calling there in the same half hour\\nShe and Mary were actually setting forward for the Great House\\nwhere as she afterwards learnt they must inevitably have found him\\nwhen they were stopped by the eldest boys being at that moment\\nbrought home in consequence of a bad fall  The childs situation\\nput the visit entirely aside but she could not hear of her escape\\nwith indifference even in the midst of the serious anxiety\\nwhich they afterwards felt on his account\\n\\nHis collarbone was found to be dislocated and such injury\\nreceived in the back as roused the most alarming ideas\\nIt was an afternoon of distress and Anne had every thing to do at once\\nthe apothecary to send for the father to have pursued and informed\\nthe mother to support and keep from hysterics the servants to control\\nthe youngest child to banish and the poor suffering one to attend\\nand soothe besides sending as soon as she recollected it\\nproper notice to the other house which brought her an accession\\nrather of frightened enquiring companions than of very useful assistants\\n\\nHer brothers return was the first comfort he could take best care\\nof his wife and the second blessing was the arrival of the apothecary\\nTill he came and had examined the child their apprehensions were\\nthe worse for being vague they suspected great injury but knew not where\\nbut now the collarbone was soon replaced and though Mr Robinson\\nfelt and felt and rubbed and looked grave and spoke low words\\nboth to the father and the aunt still they were all to hope the best\\nand to be able to part and eat their dinner in tolerable ease of mind\\nand then it was just before they parted that the two young aunts\\nwere able so far to digress from their nephews state as to give\\nthe information of Captain Wentworths visit staying five minutes behind\\ntheir father and mother to endeavour to express how perfectly delighted\\nthey were with him how much handsomer how infinitely more agreeable\\nthey thought him than any individual among their male acquaintance\\nwho had been at all a favourite before  How glad they had been\\nto hear papa invite him to stay dinner how sorry when he said\\nit was quite out of his power and how glad again when he had promised\\nin reply to papa and mammas farther pressing invitations to come\\nand dine with them on the morrowactually on the morrow\\nand he had promised it in so pleasant a manner as if he felt\\nall the motive of their attention just as he ought  And in short\\nhe had looked and said everything with such exquisite grace\\nthat they could assure them all their heads were both turned by him\\nand off they ran quite as full of glee as of love and apparently\\nmore full of Captain Wentworth than of little Charles\\n\\nThe same story and the same raptures were repeated when the two girls came\\nwith their father through the gloom of the evening to make enquiries\\nand Mr Musgrove no longer under the first uneasiness about his heir\\ncould add his confirmation and praise and hope there would be now\\nno occasion for putting Captain Wentworth off and only be sorry to think\\nthat the cottage party probably would not like to leave the little boy\\nto give him the meeting  Oh no as to leaving the little boy\\nboth father and mother were in much too strong and recent alarm\\nto bear the thought and Anne in the joy of the escape\\ncould not help adding her warm protestations to theirs\\n\\nCharles Musgrove indeed afterwards shewed more of inclination\\nthe child was going on so well and he wished so much to be introduced\\nto Captain Wentworth that perhaps he might join them in the evening\\nhe would not dine from home but he might walk in for half an hour\\nBut in this he was eagerly opposed by his wife with Oh no indeed\\nCharles I cannot bear to have you go away  Only think if anything\\nshould happen\\n\\nThe child had a good night and was going on well the next day\\nIt must be a work of time to ascertain that no injury had been\\ndone to the spine but Mr Robinson found nothing to increase alarm\\nand Charles Musgrove began consequently to feel no necessity\\nfor longer confinement  The child was to be kept in bed and amused\\nas quietly as possible but what was there for a father to do\\nThis was quite a female case and it would be highly absurd in him\\nwho could be of no use at home to shut himself up  His father\\nvery much wished him to meet Captain Wentworth and there being\\nno sufficient reason against it he ought to go and it ended in his\\nmaking a bold public declaration when he came in from shooting\\nof his meaning to dress directly and dine at the other house\\n\\nNothing can be going on better than the child said he\\nso I told my father just now that I would come and he thought me\\nquite right  Your sister being with you my love I have no scruple at all\\nYou would not like to leave him yourself but you see I can be of no use\\nAnne will send for me if anything is the matter\\n\\nHusbands and wives generally understand when opposition will be vain\\nMary knew from Charless manner of speaking that he was\\nquite determined on going and that it would be of no use to teaze him\\nShe said nothing therefore till he was out of the room\\nbut as soon as there was only Anne to hear\\n\\nSo you and I are to be left to shift by ourselves with this\\npoor sick child and not a creature coming near us all the evening\\nI knew how it would be  This is always my luck  If there is\\nanything disagreeable going on men are always sure to get out of it\\nand Charles is as bad as any of them  Very unfeeling  I must say\\nit is very unfeeling of him to be running away from his poor little boy\\nTalks of his being going on so well  How does he know that he is\\ngoing on well or that there may not be a sudden change half an hour hence\\nI did not think Charles would have been so unfeeling  So here he is to\\ngo away and enjoy himself and because I am the poor mother\\nI am not to be allowed to stir and yet I am sure I am more unfit\\nthan anybody else to be about the child  My being the mother\\nis the very reason why my feelings should not be tried  I am not at all\\nequal to it  You saw how hysterical I was yesterday\\n\\nBut that was only the effect of the suddenness of your alarm\\nof the shock  You will not be hysterical again  I dare say we shall have\\nnothing to distress us  I perfectly understand Mr Robinsons directions\\nand have no fears and indeed Mary I cannot wonder at your husband\\nNursing does not belong to a man it is not his province\\nA sick child is always the mothers property  her own feelings\\ngenerally make it so\\n\\nI hope I am as fond of my child as any mother but I do not know\\nthat I am of any more use in the sickroom than Charles\\nfor I cannot be always scolding and teazing the poor child when it is ill\\nand you saw this morning that if I told him to keep quiet\\nhe was sure to begin kicking about  I have not nerves\\nfor the sort of thing\\n\\nBut could you be comfortable yourself to be spending\\nthe whole evening away from the poor boy\\n\\nYes you see his papa can and why should not I  Jemima is so careful\\nand she could send us word every hour how he was  I really think\\nCharles might as well have told his father we would all come\\nI am not more alarmed about little Charles now than he is\\nI was dreadfully alarmed yesterday but the case is very different today\\n\\nWell if you do not think it too late to give notice for yourself\\nsuppose you were to go as well as your husband  Leave little Charles\\nto my care  Mr and Mrs Musgrove cannot think it wrong while I remain\\nwith him\\n\\nAre you serious cried Mary her eyes brightening  Dear me\\nthats a very good thought very good indeed  To be sure\\nI may just as well go as not for I am of no use at homeam I\\nand it only harasses me  You who have not a mothers feelings\\nare a great deal the properest person  You can make little Charles\\ndo anything he always minds you at a word  It will be a great deal better\\nthan leaving him only with Jemima  Oh I shall certainly go\\nI am sure I ought if I can quite as much as Charles for they want me\\nexcessively to be acquainted with Captain Wentworth and I know\\nyou do not mind being left alone  An excellent thought of yours\\nindeed Anne  I will go and tell Charles and get ready directly\\nYou can send for us you know at a moments notice if anything\\nis the matter but I dare say there will be nothing to alarm you\\nI should not go you may be sure if I did not feel quite at ease\\nabout my dear child\\n\\nThe next moment she was tapping at her husbands dressingroom door\\nand as Anne followed her up stairs she was in time for\\nthe whole conversation which began with Marys saying\\nin a tone of great exultation\\n\\nI mean to go with you Charles for I am of no more use at home\\nthan you are  If I were to shut myself up for ever with the child\\nI should not be able to persuade him to do anything he did not like\\nAnne will stay Anne undertakes to stay at home and take care of him\\nIt is Annes own proposal and so I shall go with you which will be\\na great deal better for I have not dined at the other house since Tuesday\\n\\nThis is very kind of Anne was her husbands answer and I should be\\nvery glad to have you go but it seems rather hard that she should be\\nleft at home by herself to nurse our sick child\\n\\nAnne was now at hand to take up her own cause and the sincerity\\nof her manner being soon sufficient to convince him where conviction\\nwas at least very agreeable he had no farther scruples as to her being\\nleft to dine alone though he still wanted her to join them in the evening\\nwhen the child might be at rest for the night and kindly urged her\\nto let him come and fetch her but she was quite unpersuadable\\nand this being the case she had ere long the pleasure of seeing them\\nset off together in high spirits  They were gone she hoped\\nto be happy however oddly constructed such happiness might seem\\nas for herself she was left with as many sensations of comfort\\nas were perhaps ever likely to be hers  She knew herself to be\\nof the first utility to the child and what was it to her\\nif Frederick Wentworth were only half a mile distant making himself\\nagreeable to others\\n\\nShe would have liked to know how he felt as to a meeting\\nPerhaps indifferent if indifference could exist under such circumstances\\nHe must be either indifferent or unwilling  Had he wished\\never to see her again he need not have waited till this time\\nhe would have done what she could not but believe that in his place\\nshe should have done long ago when events had been early giving him\\nthe independence which alone had been wanting\\n\\nHer brother and sister came back delighted with their new acquaintance\\nand their visit in general  There had been music singing\\ntalking laughing all that was most agreeable charming manners\\nin Captain Wentworth no shyness or reserve they seemed all\\nto know each other perfectly and he was coming the very next morning\\nto shoot with Charles  He was to come to breakfast but not at the Cottage\\nthough that had been proposed at first but then he had been pressed\\nto come to the Great House instead and he seemed afraid of being\\nin Mrs Charles Musgroves way on account of the child and therefore\\nsomehow they hardly knew how it ended in Charless being to meet him\\nto breakfast at his fathers\\n\\nAnne understood it  He wished to avoid seeing her  He had inquired\\nafter her she found slightly as might suit a former slight acquaintance\\nseeming to acknowledge such as she had acknowledged actuated perhaps\\nby the same view of escaping introduction when they were to meet\\n\\nThe morning hours of the Cottage were always later than those\\nof the other house and on the morrow the difference was so great\\nthat Mary and Anne were not more than beginning breakfast when\\nCharles came in to say that they were just setting off that he was\\ncome for his dogs that his sisters were following with Captain Wentworth\\nhis sisters meaning to visit Mary and the child and Captain Wentworth\\nproposing also to wait on her for a few minutes if not inconvenient\\nand though Charles had answered for the childs being in no such state\\nas could make it inconvenient Captain Wentworth would not be satisfied\\nwithout his running on to give notice\\n\\nMary very much gratified by this attention was delighted to receive him\\nwhile a thousand feelings rushed on Anne of which this was\\nthe most consoling that it would soon be over  And it was soon over\\nIn two minutes after Charless preparation the others appeared\\nthey were in the drawingroom  Her eye half met Captain Wentworths\\na bow a curtsey passed she heard his voice he talked to Mary\\nsaid all that was right said something to the Miss Musgroves\\nenough to mark an easy footing the room seemed full full of persons\\nand voices but a few minutes ended it  Charles shewed himself\\nat the window all was ready their visitor had bowed and was gone\\nthe Miss Musgroves were gone too suddenly resolving to walk\\nto the end of the village with the sportsmen  the room was cleared\\nand Anne might finish her breakfast as she could\\n\\nIt is over it is over she repeated to herself again and again\\nin nervous gratitude  The worst is over\\n\\nMary talked but she could not attend  She had seen him\\nThey had met  They had been once more in the same room\\n\\nSoon however she began to reason with herself and try to be feeling less\\nEight years almost eight years had passed since all had been given up\\nHow absurd to be resuming the agitation which such an interval\\nhad banished into distance and indistinctness  What might not\\neight years do  Events of every description changes alienations\\nremovalsall all must be comprised in it and oblivion of the past\\nhow natural how certain too  It included nearly a third part\\nof her own life\\n\\nAlas with all her reasoning she found that to retentive feelings\\neight years may be little more than nothing\\n\\nNow how were his sentiments to be read  Was this like\\nwishing to avoid her  And the next moment she was hating herself\\nfor the folly which asked the question\\n\\nOn one other question which perhaps her utmost wisdom\\nmight not have prevented she was soon spared all suspense\\nfor after the Miss Musgroves had returned and finished their visit\\nat the Cottage she had this spontaneous information from Mary \\n\\nCaptain Wentworth is not very gallant by you Anne though he was\\nso attentive to me  Henrietta asked him what he thought of you\\nwhen they went away and he said You were so altered he should not\\nhave known you again\\n\\nMary had no feelings to make her respect her sisters in a common way\\nbut she was perfectly unsuspicious of being inflicting any peculiar wound\\n\\nAltered beyond his knowledge  Anne fully submitted in silent\\ndeep mortification  Doubtless it was so and she could take no revenge\\nfor he was not altered or not for the worse  She had already\\nacknowledged it to herself and she could not think differently\\nlet him think of her as he would  No  the years which had destroyed\\nher youth and bloom had only given him a more glowing manly\\nopen look in no respect lessening his personal advantages\\nShe had seen the same Frederick Wentworth\\n\\nSo altered that he should not have known her again  These were words\\nwhich could not but dwell with her  Yet she soon began to rejoice\\nthat she had heard them  They were of sobering tendency\\nthey allayed agitation they composed and consequently must\\nmake her happier\\n\\nFrederick Wentworth had used such words or something like them\\nbut without an idea that they would be carried round to her\\nHe had thought her wretchedly altered and in the first moment of appeal\\nhad spoken as he felt  He had not forgiven Anne Elliot\\nShe had used him ill deserted and disappointed him and worse\\nshe had shewn a feebleness of character in doing so which his own decided\\nconfident temper could not endure  She had given him up to oblige others\\nIt had been the effect of overpersuasion  It had been\\nweakness and timidity\\n\\nHe had been most warmly attached to her and had never seen a woman since\\nwhom he thought her equal but except from some natural sensation\\nof curiosity he had no desire of meeting her again  Her power with him\\nwas gone for ever\\n\\nIt was now his object to marry  He was rich and being turned on shore\\nfully intended to settle as soon as he could be properly tempted\\nactually looking round ready to fall in love with all the speed\\nwhich a clear head and a quick taste could allow  He had a heart\\nfor either of the Miss Musgroves if they could catch it a heart\\nin short for any pleasing young woman who came in his way\\nexcepting Anne Elliot  This was his only secret exception\\nwhen he said to his sister in answer to her suppositions\\n\\nYes here I am Sophia quite ready to make a foolish match\\nAnybody between fifteen and thirty may have me for asking\\nA little beauty and a few smiles and a few compliments to the navy\\nand I am a lost man  Should not this be enough for a sailor\\nwho has had no society among women to make him nice\\n\\nHe said it she knew to be contradicted  His bright proud eye\\nspoke the conviction that he was nice and Anne Elliot was\\nnot out of his thoughts when he more seriously described\\nthe woman he should wish to meet with  A strong mind\\nwith sweetness of manner made the first and the last of the description\\n\\nThat is the woman I want said he  Something a little inferior\\nI shall of course put up with but it must not be much  If I am a fool\\nI shall be a fool indeed for I have thought on the subject\\nmore than most men\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 8\\n\\n\\nFrom this time Captain Wentworth and Anne Elliot were repeatedly\\nin the same circle  They were soon dining in company together\\nat Mr Musgroves for the little boys state could no longer\\nsupply his aunt with a pretence for absenting herself and this was\\nbut the beginning of other dinings and other meetings\\n\\nWhether former feelings were to be renewed must be brought to the proof\\nformer times must undoubtedly be brought to the recollection of each\\nthey could not but be reverted to the year of their engagement\\ncould not but be named by him in the little narratives or descriptions\\nwhich conversation called forth  His profession qualified him\\nhis disposition lead him to talk and That was in the year six\\nThat happened before I went to sea in the year six occurred\\nin the course of the first evening they spent together\\nand though his voice did not falter and though she had no reason\\nto suppose his eye wandering towards her while he spoke\\nAnne felt the utter impossibility from her knowledge of his mind\\nthat he could be unvisited by remembrance any more than herself\\nThere must be the same immediate association of thought\\nthough she was very far from conceiving it to be of equal pain\\n\\nThey had no conversation together no intercourse but what\\nthe commonest civility required  Once so much to each other\\nNow nothing  There had been a time when of all the large party\\nnow filling the drawingroom at Uppercross they would have found it\\nmost difficult to cease to speak to one another  With the exception\\nperhaps of Admiral and Mrs Croft who seemed particularly attached\\nand happy Anne could allow no other exceptions even among\\nthe married couples there could have been no two hearts so open\\nno tastes so similar no feelings so in unison no countenances so beloved\\nNow they were as strangers nay worse than strangers for they could\\nnever become acquainted  It was a perpetual estrangement\\n\\nWhen he talked she heard the same voice and discerned the same mind\\nThere was a very general ignorance of all naval matters throughout the party\\nand he was very much questioned and especially by the two Miss Musgroves\\nwho seemed hardly to have any eyes but for him as to the manner\\nof living on board daily regulations food hours c and their surprise\\nat his accounts at learning the degree of accommodation and arrangement\\nwhich was practicable drew from him some pleasant ridicule\\nwhich reminded Anne of the early days when she too had been ignorant\\nand she too had been accused of supposing sailors to be living on board\\nwithout anything to eat or any cook to dress it if there were\\nor any servant to wait or any knife and fork to use\\n\\nFrom thus listening and thinking she was roused by a whisper\\nof Mrs Musgroves who overcome by fond regrets could not help saying\\n\\nAh Miss Anne if it had pleased Heaven to spare my poor son\\nI dare say he would have been just such another by this time\\n\\nAnne suppressed a smile and listened kindly while Mrs Musgrove\\nrelieved her heart a little more and for a few minutes therefore\\ncould not keep pace with the conversation of the others\\n\\nWhen she could let her attention take its natural course again\\nshe found the Miss Musgroves just fetching the Navy List\\ntheir own navy list the first that had ever been at Uppercross\\nand sitting down together to pore over it with the professed view\\nof finding out the ships that Captain Wentworth had commanded\\n\\nYour first was the Asp I remember we will look for the Asp\\n\\nYou will not find her there  Quite worn out and broken up\\nI was the last man who commanded her  Hardly fit for service then\\nReported fit for home service for a year or two and so I was sent off\\nto the West Indies\\n\\nThe girls looked all amazement\\n\\nThe Admiralty he continued entertain themselves now and then\\nwith sending a few hundred men to sea in a ship not fit to be employed\\nBut they have a great many to provide for and among the thousands\\nthat may just as well go to the bottom as not it is impossible\\nfor them to distinguish the very set who may be least missed\\n\\nPhoo phoo cried the Admiral what stuff these young fellows talk\\nNever was a better sloop than the Asp in her day  For an old built sloop\\nyou would not see her equal  Lucky fellow to get her  He knows there\\nmust have been twenty better men than himself applying for her\\nat the same time  Lucky fellow to get anything so soon\\nwith no more interest than his\\n\\nI felt my luck Admiral I assure you replied Captain Wentworth\\nseriously  I was as well satisfied with my appointment as you can desire\\nIt was a great object with me at that time to be at sea\\na very great object I wanted to be doing something\\n\\nTo be sure you did  What should a young fellow like you do ashore\\nfor half a year together  If a man had not a wife he soon wants\\nto be afloat again\\n\\nBut Captain Wentworth cried Louisa how vexed you must have been\\nwhen you came to the Asp to see what an old thing they had given you\\n\\nI knew pretty well what she was before that day said he smiling\\nI had no more discoveries to make than you would have as to\\nthe fashion and strength of any old pelisse which you had seen\\nlent about among half your acquaintance ever since you could remember\\nand which at last on some very wet day is lent to yourself\\nAh she was a dear old Asp to me  She did all that I wanted\\nI knew she would  I knew that we should either go to the bottom together\\nor that she would be the making of me and I never had two days\\nof foul weather all the time I was at sea in her and after\\ntaking privateers enough to be very entertaining I had the good luck\\nin my passage home the next autumn to fall in with the very French frigate\\nI wanted  I brought her into Plymouth and here another instance of luck\\nWe had not been six hours in the Sound when a gale came on\\nwhich lasted four days and nights and which would have done for\\npoor old Asp in half the time our touch with the Great Nation\\nnot having much improved our condition  Fourandtwenty hours later\\nand I should only have been a gallant Captain Wentworth\\nin a small paragraph at one corner of the newspapers and being lost\\nin only a sloop nobody would have thought about me Annes shudderings\\nwere to herself alone but the Miss Musgroves could be as open\\nas they were sincere in their exclamations of pity and horror\\n\\nAnd so then I suppose said Mrs Musgrove in a low voice\\nas if thinking aloud so then he went away to the Laconia and there\\nhe met with our poor boy Charles my dear beckoning him to her\\ndo ask Captain Wentworth where it was he first met with your poor brother\\nI always forgot\\n\\nIt was at Gibraltar mother I know  Dick had been left ill at Gibraltar\\nwith a recommendation from his former captain to Captain Wentworth\\n\\nOh but Charles tell Captain Wentworth he need not be afraid\\nof mentioning poor Dick before me for it would be rather a pleasure\\nto hear him talked of by such a good friend\\n\\nCharles being somewhat more mindful of the probabilities of the case\\nonly nodded in reply and walked away\\n\\nThe girls were now hunting for the Laconia and Captain Wentworth\\ncould not deny himself the pleasure of taking the precious volume\\ninto his own hands to save them the trouble and once more read aloud\\nthe little statement of her name and rate and present\\nnoncommissioned class observing over it that she too had been\\none of the best friends man ever had\\n\\nAh those were pleasant days when I had the Laconia  How fast I\\nmade money in her  A friend of mine and I had such a lovely cruise\\ntogether off the Western Islands  Poor Harville sister\\nYou know how much he wanted money  worse than myself  He had a wife\\nExcellent fellow  I shall never forget his happiness  He felt it all\\nso much for her sake  I wished for him again the next summer\\nwhen I had still the same luck in the Mediterranean\\n\\nAnd I am sure Sir said Mrs Musgrove it was a lucky day for us\\nwhen you were put captain into that ship  We shall never forget\\nwhat you did\\n\\nHer feelings made her speak low and Captain Wentworth\\nhearing only in part and probably not having Dick Musgrove at all\\nnear his thoughts looked rather in suspense and as if waiting for more\\n\\nMy brother whispered one of the girls mamma is thinking\\nof poor Richard\\n\\nPoor dear fellow continued Mrs Musgrove he was grown so steady\\nand such an excellent correspondent while he was under your care\\nAh it would have been a happy thing if he had never left you\\nI assure you Captain Wentworth we are very sorry he ever left you\\n\\nThere was a momentary expression in Captain Wentworths face at this speech\\na certain glance of his bright eye and curl of his handsome mouth\\nwhich convinced Anne that instead of sharing in Mrs Musgroves kind wishes\\nas to her son he had probably been at some pains to get rid of him\\nbut it was too transient an indulgence of selfamusement to be detected\\nby any who understood him less than herself in another moment\\nhe was perfectly collected and serious and almost instantly afterwards\\ncoming up to the sofa on which she and Mrs Musgrove were sitting\\ntook a place by the latter and entered into conversation with her\\nin a low voice about her son doing it with so much sympathy\\nand natural grace as shewed the kindest consideration for all\\nthat was real and unabsurd in the parents feelings\\n\\nThey were actually on the same sofa for Mrs Musgrove had\\nmost readily made room for him they were divided only by Mrs Musgrove\\nIt was no insignificant barrier indeed  Mrs Musgrove was of\\na comfortable substantial size infinitely more fitted by nature\\nto express good cheer and good humour than tenderness and sentiment\\nand while the agitations of Annes slender form and pensive face\\nmay be considered as very completely screened Captain Wentworth\\nshould be allowed some credit for the selfcommand with which\\nhe attended to her large fat sighings over the destiny of a son\\nwhom alive nobody had cared for\\n\\nPersonal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary proportions\\nA large bulky figure has as good a right to be in deep affliction\\nas the most graceful set of limbs in the world  But fair or not fair\\nthere are unbecoming conjunctions which reason will patronize in vain\\nwhich taste cannot toleratewhich ridicule will seize\\n\\nThe Admiral after taking two or three refreshing turns about the room\\nwith his hands behind him being called to order by his wife\\nnow came up to Captain Wentworth and without any observation\\nof what he might be interrupting thinking only of his own thoughts\\nbegan with\\n\\nIf you had been a week later at Lisbon last spring Frederick\\nyou would have been asked to give a passage to Lady Mary Grierson\\nand her daughters\\n\\nShould I  I am glad I was not a week later then\\n\\nThe Admiral abused him for his want of gallantry  He defended himself\\nthough professing that he would never willingly admit any ladies\\non board a ship of his excepting for a ball or a visit\\nwhich a few hours might comprehend\\n\\nBut if I know myself said he this is from no want of gallantry\\ntowards them  It is rather from feeling how impossible it is\\nwith all ones efforts and all ones sacrifices to make\\nthe accommodations on board such as women ought to have\\nThere can be no want of gallantry Admiral in rating the claims of women\\nto every personal comfort high and this is what I do  I hate to hear\\nof women on board or to see them on board and no ship under my command\\nshall ever convey a family of ladies anywhere if I can help it\\n\\nThis brought his sister upon him\\n\\nOh Frederick  But I cannot believe it of you All idle refinement\\nWomen may be as comfortable on board as in the best house in England\\nI believe I have lived as much on board as most women and I know\\nnothing superior to the accommodations of a manofwar  I declare\\nI have not a comfort or an indulgence about me even at Kellynch Hall\\nwith a kind bow to Anne beyond what I always had in most of\\nthe ships I have lived in and they have been five altogether\\n\\nNothing to the purpose replied her brother  You were living\\nwith your husband and were the only woman on board\\n\\nBut you yourself brought Mrs Harville her sister her cousin\\nand three children round from Portsmouth to Plymouth  Where was this\\nsuperfine extraordinary sort of gallantry of yours then\\n\\nAll merged in my friendship Sophia  I would assist any\\nbrother officers wife that I could and I would bring anything\\nof Harvilles from the worlds end if he wanted it  But do not imagine\\nthat I did not feel it an evil in itself\\n\\nDepend upon it they were all perfectly comfortable\\n\\nI might not like them the better for that perhaps  Such a number\\nof women and children have no right to be comfortable on board\\n\\nMy dear Frederick you are talking quite idly  Pray what would\\nbecome of us poor sailors wives who often want to be conveyed to\\none port or another after our husbands if everybody had your feelings\\n\\nMy feelings you see did not prevent my taking Mrs Harville\\nand all her family to Plymouth\\n\\nBut I hate to hear you talking so like a fine gentleman\\nand as if women were all fine ladies instead of rational creatures\\nWe none of us expect to be in smooth water all our days\\n\\nAh my dear said the Admiral when he had got a wife\\nhe will sing a different tune  When he is married if we have\\nthe good luck to live to another war we shall see him do as you and I\\nand a great many others have done  We shall have him very thankful\\nto anybody that will bring him his wife\\n\\nAy that we shall\\n\\nNow I have done cried Captain Wentworth  When once married\\npeople begin to attack me withOh you will think very differently\\nwhen you are married  I can only say No I shall not and then\\nthey say again Yes you will and there is an end of it\\n\\nHe got up and moved away\\n\\nWhat a great traveller you must have been maam said Mrs Musgrove\\nto Mrs Croft\\n\\nPretty well maam in the fifteen years of my marriage\\nthough many women have done more  I have crossed the Atlantic\\nfour times and have been once to the East Indies and back again\\nand only once besides being in different places about home\\nCork and Lisbon and Gibraltar  But I never went beyond the Streights\\nand never was in the West Indies  We do not call Bermuda or Bahama\\nyou know the West Indies\\n\\nMrs Musgrove had not a word to say in dissent she could not accuse herself\\nof having ever called them anything in the whole course of her life\\n\\nAnd I do assure you maam pursued Mrs Croft that nothing can exceed\\nthe accommodations of a manofwar I speak you know of the higher rates\\nWhen you come to a frigate of course you are more confined\\nthough any reasonable woman may be perfectly happy in one of them\\nand I can safely say that the happiest part of my life has been spent\\non board a ship  While we were together you know there was nothing\\nto be feared  Thank God  I have always been blessed with\\nexcellent health and no climate disagrees with me  A little disordered\\nalways the first twentyfour hours of going to sea but never knew\\nwhat sickness was afterwards  The only time I ever really suffered\\nin body or mind the only time that I ever fancied myself unwell\\nor had any ideas of danger was the winter that I passed by myself at Deal\\nwhen the Admiral Captain Croft then was in the North Seas\\nI lived in perpetual fright at that time and had all manner of\\nimaginary complaints from not knowing what to do with myself\\nor when I should hear from him next but as long as we could be together\\nnothing ever ailed me and I never met with the smallest inconvenience\\n\\nAye to be sure  Yes indeed oh yes  I am quite of your opinion\\nMrs Croft was Mrs Musgroves hearty answer  There is nothing so bad\\nas a separation  I am quite of your opinion  I know what it is\\nfor Mr Musgrove always attends the assizes and I am so glad when\\nthey are over and he is safe back again\\n\\nThe evening ended with dancing  On its being proposed\\nAnne offered her services as usual and though her eyes would sometimes\\nfill with tears as she sat at the instrument she was extremely glad\\nto be employed and desired nothing in return but to be unobserved\\n\\nIt was a merry joyous party and no one seemed in higher spirits\\nthan Captain Wentworth  She felt that he had every thing to elevate\\nhim which general attention and deference and especially the attention\\nof all the young women could do  The Miss Hayters the females\\nof the family of cousins already mentioned were apparently admitted\\nto the honour of being in love with him and as for Henrietta and Louisa\\nthey both seemed so entirely occupied by him that nothing but\\nthe continued appearance of the most perfect goodwill between themselves\\ncould have made it credible that they were not decided rivals\\nIf he were a little spoilt by such universal such eager admiration\\nwho could wonder\\n\\nThese were some of the thoughts which occupied Anne while her fingers\\nwere mechanically at work proceeding for half an hour together\\nequally without error and without consciousness  Once she felt\\nthat he was looking at herself  observing her altered features\\nperhaps trying to trace in them the ruins of the face which had once\\ncharmed him and once she knew that he must have spoken of her\\nshe was hardly aware of it till she heard the answer but then she was\\nsure of his having asked his partner whether Miss Elliot never danced\\nThe answer was Oh no never she has quite given up dancing\\nShe had rather play  She is never tired of playing  Once too\\nhe spoke to her  She had left the instrument on the dancing being over\\nand he had sat down to try to make out an air which he wished\\nto give the Miss Musgroves an idea of  Unintentionally she returned\\nto that part of the room he saw her and instantly rising\\nsaid with studied politeness\\n\\nI beg your pardon madam this is your seat and though she immediately\\ndrew back with a decided negative he was not to be induced\\nto sit down again\\n\\nAnne did not wish for more of such looks and speeches\\nHis cold politeness his ceremonious grace were worse than anything\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 9\\n\\n\\nCaptain Wentworth was come to Kellynch as to a home to stay\\nas long as he liked being as thoroughly the object of\\nthe Admirals fraternal kindness as of his wifes  He had intended\\non first arriving to proceed very soon into Shropshire\\nand visit the brother settled in that country but the attractions\\nof Uppercross induced him to put this off  There was so much\\nof friendliness and of flattery and of everything most bewitching\\nin his reception there the old were so hospitable the young so agreeable\\nthat he could not but resolve to remain where he was and take all\\nthe charms and perfections of Edwards wife upon credit a little longer\\n\\nIt was soon Uppercross with him almost every day  The Musgroves\\ncould hardly be more ready to invite than he to come particularly\\nin the morning when he had no companion at home for the Admiral\\nand Mrs Croft were generally out of doors together interesting themselves\\nin their new possessions their grass and their sheep and dawdling about\\nin a way not endurable to a third person or driving out in a gig\\nlately added to their establishment\\n\\nHitherto there had been but one opinion of Captain Wentworth\\namong the Musgroves and their dependencies  It was unvarying\\nwarm admiration everywhere but this intimate footing was not more\\nthan established when a certain Charles Hayter returned among them\\nto be a good deal disturbed by it and to think Captain Wentworth\\nvery much in the way\\n\\nCharles Hayter was the eldest of all the cousins and a very amiable\\npleasing young man between whom and Henrietta there had been\\na considerable appearance of attachment previous to Captain Wentworths\\nintroduction  He was in orders and having a curacy in the neighbourhood\\nwhere residence was not required lived at his fathers house\\nonly two miles from Uppercross  A short absence from home\\nhad left his fair one unguarded by his attentions at this critical period\\nand when he came back he had the pain of finding very altered manners\\nand of seeing Captain Wentworth\\n\\nMrs Musgrove and Mrs Hayter were sisters  They had each had money\\nbut their marriages had made a material difference in\\ntheir degree of consequence  Mr Hayter had some property of his own\\nbut it was insignificant compared with Mr Musgroves and while\\nthe Musgroves were in the first class of society in the country\\nthe young Hayters would from their parents inferior retired\\nand unpolished way of living and their own defective education\\nhave been hardly in any class at all but for their connexion\\nwith Uppercross this eldest son of course excepted who had chosen\\nto be a scholar and a gentleman and who was very superior\\nin cultivation and manners to all the rest\\n\\nThe two families had always been on excellent terms there being no pride\\non one side and no envy on the other and only such a consciousness\\nof superiority in the Miss Musgroves as made them pleased\\nto improve their cousins  Charless attentions to Henrietta\\nhad been observed by her father and mother without any disapprobation\\nIt would not be a great match for her but if Henrietta liked him\\nand Henrietta did seem to like him\\n\\nHenrietta fully thought so herself before Captain Wentworth came\\nbut from that time Cousin Charles had been very much forgotten\\n\\nWhich of the two sisters was preferred by Captain Wentworth was\\nas yet quite doubtful as far as Annes observation reached\\nHenrietta was perhaps the prettiest Louisa had the higher spirits\\nand she knew not now whether the more gentle or the more lively character\\nwere most likely to attract him\\n\\nMr and Mrs Musgrove either from seeing little or from\\nan entire confidence in the discretion of both their daughters\\nand of all the young men who came near them seemed to leave everything\\nto take its chance  There was not the smallest appearance of solicitude\\nor remark about them in the Mansionhouse but it was different\\nat the Cottage  the young couple there were more disposed\\nto speculate and wonder and Captain Wentworth had not been above\\nfour or five times in the Miss Musgroves company and Charles Hayter\\nhad but just reappeared when Anne had to listen to the opinions\\nof her brother and sister as to which was the one liked best\\nCharles gave it for Louisa Mary for Henrietta but quite agreeing\\nthat to have him marry either could be extremely delightful\\n\\nCharles had never seen a pleasanter man in his life and from what\\nhe had once heard Captain Wentworth himself say was very sure that\\nhe had not made less than twenty thousand pounds by the war\\nHere was a fortune at once besides which there would be the chance\\nof what might be done in any future war and he was sure Captain Wentworth\\nwas as likely a man to distinguish himself as any officer in the navy\\nOh it would be a capital match for either of his sisters\\n\\nUpon my word it would replied Mary  Dear me  If he should\\nrise to any very great honours  If he should ever be made a baronet\\nLady Wentworth sounds very well  That would be a noble thing\\nindeed for Henrietta  She would take place of me then and Henrietta\\nwould not dislike that  Sir Frederick and Lady Wentworth\\nIt would be but a new creation however and I never think much\\nof your new creations\\n\\nIt suited Mary best to think Henrietta the one preferred\\non the very account of Charles Hayter whose pretensions she wished\\nto see put an end to  She looked down very decidedly upon the Hayters\\nand thought it would be quite a misfortune to have the existing connection\\nbetween the families renewedvery sad for herself and her children\\n\\nYou know said she I cannot think him at all a fit match for Henrietta\\nand considering the alliances which the Musgroves have made\\nshe has no right to throw herself away  I do not think any young woman\\nhas a right to make a choice that may be disagreeable and inconvenient\\nto the principal part of her family and be giving bad connections\\nto those who have not been used to them  And pray who is Charles Hayter\\nNothing but a country curate  A most improper match for Miss Musgrove\\nof Uppercross\\n\\nHer husband however would not agree with her here for besides having\\na regard for his cousin Charles Hayter was an eldest son\\nand he saw things as an eldest son himself\\n\\nNow you are taking nonsense Mary was therefore his answer\\nIt would not be a great match for Henrietta but Charles has\\na very fair chance through the Spicers of getting something from\\nthe Bishop in the course of a year or two and you will please to remember\\nthat he is the eldest son whenever my uncle dies he steps into very\\npretty property  The estate at Winthrop is not less than\\ntwo hundred and fifty acres besides the farm near Taunton\\nwhich is some of the best land in the country  I grant you\\nthat any of them but Charles would be a very shocking match for Henrietta\\nand indeed it could not be he is the only one that could be possible\\nbut he is a very goodnatured good sort of a fellow and whenever Winthrop\\ncomes into his hands he will make a different sort of place of it\\nand live in a very different sort of way and with that property\\nhe will never be a contemptible mangood freehold property  No no\\nHenrietta might do worse than marry Charles Hayter and if she has him\\nand Louisa can get Captain Wentworth I shall be very well satisfied\\n\\nCharles may say what he pleases cried Mary to Anne as soon as\\nhe was out of the room but it would be shocking to have Henrietta\\nmarry Charles Hayter a very bad thing for her and still worse\\nfor me and therefore it is very much to be wished that Captain Wentworth\\nmay soon put him quite out of her head and I have very little doubt\\nthat he has  She took hardly any notice of Charles Hayter yesterday\\nI wish you had been there to see her behaviour  And as to\\nCaptain Wentworths liking Louisa as well as Henrietta it is nonsense\\nto say so for he certainly does like Henrietta a great deal the best\\nBut Charles is so positive  I wish you had been with us yesterday\\nfor then you might have decided between us and I am sure you\\nwould have thought as I did unless you had been determined\\nto give it against me\\n\\nA dinner at Mr Musgroves had been the occasion when all these things\\nshould have been seen by Anne but she had staid at home\\nunder the mixed plea of a headache of her own and some return\\nof indisposition in little Charles  She had thought only of avoiding\\nCaptain Wentworth but an escape from being appealed to as umpire\\nwas now added to the advantages of a quiet evening\\n\\nAs to Captain Wentworths views she deemed it of more consequence\\nthat he should know his own mind early enough not to be endangering\\nthe happiness of either sister or impeaching his own honour\\nthan that he should prefer Henrietta to Louisa or Louisa to Henrietta\\nEither of them would in all probability make him an affectionate\\ngoodhumoured wife  With regard to Charles Hayter she had delicacy\\nwhich must be pained by any lightness of conduct in a wellmeaning\\nyoung woman and a heart to sympathize in any of the sufferings\\nit occasioned but if Henrietta found herself mistaken in the nature\\nof her feelings the alternation could not be understood too soon\\n\\nCharles Hayter had met with much to disquiet and mortify him\\nin his cousins behaviour  She had too old a regard for him\\nto be so wholly estranged as might in two meetings extinguish\\nevery past hope and leave him nothing to do but to keep away\\nfrom Uppercross  but there was such a change as became very alarming\\nwhen such a man as Captain Wentworth was to be regarded as\\nthe probable cause  He had been absent only two Sundays\\nand when they parted had left her interested even to the height\\nof his wishes in his prospect of soon quitting his present curacy\\nand obtaining that of Uppercross instead  It had then seemed the object\\nnearest her heart that Dr Shirley the rector who for more than\\nforty years had been zealously discharging all the duties of his office\\nbut was now growing too infirm for many of them should be quite fixed\\non engaging a curate should make his curacy quite as good\\nas he could afford and should give Charles Hayter the promise of it\\nThe advantage of his having to come only to Uppercross instead of going\\nsix miles another way of his having in every respect a better curacy\\nof his belonging to their dear Dr Shirley and of dear good Dr Shirleys\\nbeing relieved from the duty which he could no longer get through\\nwithout most injurious fatigue had been a great deal even to Louisa\\nbut had been almost everything to Henrietta  When he came back alas\\nthe zeal of the business was gone by  Louisa could not listen at all\\nto his account of a conversation which he had just held with Dr Shirley\\nshe was at a window looking out for Captain Wentworth and even Henrietta\\nhad at best only a divided attention to give and seemed to have forgotten\\nall the former doubt and solicitude of the negotiation\\n\\nWell I am very glad indeed  but I always thought you would have it\\nI always thought you sure  It did not appear to me thatin short\\nyou know Dr Shirley must have a curate and you had secured his promise\\nIs he coming Louisa\\n\\nOne morning very soon after the dinner at the Musgroves\\nat which Anne had not been present Captain Wentworth walked into\\nthe drawingroom at the Cottage where were only herself and the little\\ninvalid Charles who was lying on the sofa\\n\\nThe surprise of finding himself almost alone with Anne Elliot\\ndeprived his manners of their usual composure  he started\\nand could only say I thought the Miss Musgroves had been here\\nMrs Musgrove told me I should find them here before he walked\\nto the window to recollect himself and feel how he ought to behave\\n\\nThey are up stairs with my sister  they will be down in a few moments\\nI dare say had been Annes reply in all the confusion that was natural\\nand if the child had not called her to come and do something for him\\nshe would have been out of the room the next moment and released\\nCaptain Wentworth as well as herself\\n\\nHe continued at the window and after calmly and politely saying\\nI hope the little boy is better was silent\\n\\nShe was obliged to kneel down by the sofa and remain there\\nto satisfy her patient and thus they continued a few minutes\\nwhen to her very great satisfaction she heard some other person\\ncrossing the little vestibule  She hoped on turning her head\\nto see the master of the house but it proved to be one\\nmuch less calculated for making matters easyCharles Hayter\\nprobably not at all better pleased by the sight of Captain Wentworth\\nthan Captain Wentworth had been by the sight of Anne\\n\\nShe only attempted to say How do you do  Will you not sit down\\nThe others will be here presently\\n\\nCaptain Wentworth however came from his window apparently\\nnot illdisposed for conversation but Charles Hayter soon put an end\\nto his attempts by seating himself near the table and taking up\\nthe newspaper and Captain Wentworth returned to his window\\n\\nAnother minute brought another addition  The younger boy\\na remarkable stout forward child of two years old having got the door\\nopened for him by some one without made his determined appearance\\namong them and went straight to the sofa to see what was going on\\nand put in his claim to anything good that might be giving away\\n\\nThere being nothing to eat he could only have some play\\nand as his aunt would not let him tease his sick brother\\nhe began to fasten himself upon her as she knelt in such a way that\\nbusy as she was about Charles she could not shake him off\\nShe spoke to him ordered entreated and insisted in vain\\nOnce she did contrive to push him away but the boy had\\nthe greater pleasure in getting upon her back again directly\\n\\nWalter said she get down this moment  You are extremely troublesome\\nI am very angry with you\\n\\nWalter cried Charles Hayter why do you not do as you are bid\\nDo not you hear your aunt speak  Come to me Walter come to\\ncousin Charles\\n\\nBut not a bit did Walter stir\\n\\nIn another moment however she found herself in the state of\\nbeing released from him some one was taking him from her\\nthough he had bent down her head so much that his little sturdy hands\\nwere unfastened from around her neck and he was resolutely borne away\\nbefore she knew that Captain Wentworth had done it\\n\\nHer sensations on the discovery made her perfectly speechless\\nShe could not even thank him  She could only hang over little Charles\\nwith most disordered feelings  His kindness in stepping forward\\nto her relief the manner the silence in which it had passed\\nthe little particulars of the circumstance with the conviction soon\\nforced on her by the noise he was studiously making with the child\\nthat he meant to avoid hearing her thanks and rather sought\\nto testify that her conversation was the last of his wants\\nproduced such a confusion of varying but very painful agitation\\nas she could not recover from till enabled by the entrance of Mary\\nand the Miss Musgroves to make over her little patient to their cares\\nand leave the room  She could not stay  It might have been\\nan opportunity of watching the loves and jealousies of the four\\nthey were now altogether but she could stay for none of it\\nIt was evident that Charles Hayter was not well inclined towards\\nCaptain Wentworth  She had a strong impression of his having said\\nin a vext tone of voice after Captain Wentworths interference\\nYou ought to have minded me Walter I told you not to teaze your aunt\\nand could comprehend his regretting that Captain Wentworth should do\\nwhat he ought to have done himself  But neither Charles Hayters feelings\\nnor anybodys feelings could interest her till she had a little better\\narranged her own  She was ashamed of herself quite ashamed\\nof being so nervous so overcome by such a trifle but so it was\\nand it required a long application of solitude and reflection\\nto recover her\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 10\\n\\n\\nOther opportunities of making her observations could not fail to occur\\nAnne had soon been in company with all the four together often enough\\nto have an opinion though too wise to acknowledge as much at home\\nwhere she knew it would have satisfied neither husband nor wife\\nfor while she considered Louisa to be rather the favourite\\nshe could not but think as far as she might dare to judge from memory\\nand experience that Captain Wentworth was not in love with either\\nThey were more in love with him yet there it was not love\\nIt was a little fever of admiration but it might probably must\\nend in love with some  Charles Hayter seemed aware of being slighted\\nand yet Henrietta had sometimes the air of being divided between them\\nAnne longed for the power of representing to them all what they were about\\nand of pointing out some of the evils they were exposing themselves to\\nShe did not attribute guile to any  It was the highest satisfaction\\nto her to believe Captain Wentworth not in the least aware\\nof the pain he was occasioning  There was no triumph no pitiful triumph\\nin his manner  He had probably never heard and never thought of\\nany claims of Charles Hayter  He was only wrong in accepting\\nthe attentions for accepting must be the word of two young women at once\\n\\nAfter a short struggle however Charles Hayter seemed to quit the field\\nThree days had passed without his coming once to Uppercross\\na most decided change  He had even refused one regular invitation to dinner\\nand having been found on the occasion by Mr Musgrove with some large books\\nbefore him Mr and Mrs Musgrove were sure all could not be right\\nand talked with grave faces of his studying himself to death\\nIt was Marys hope and belief that he had received a positive dismissal\\nfrom Henrietta and her husband lived under the constant dependence\\nof seeing him tomorrow  Anne could only feel that Charles Hayter\\nwas wise\\n\\nOne morning about this time Charles Musgrove and Captain Wentworth\\nbeing gone ashooting together as the sisters in the Cottage\\nwere sitting quietly at work they were visited at the window\\nby the sisters from the Mansionhouse\\n\\nIt was a very fine November day and the Miss Musgroves came\\nthrough the little grounds and stopped for no other purpose than to say\\nthat they were going to take a long walk and therefore concluded\\nMary could not like to go with them and when Mary immediately replied\\nwith some jealousy at not being supposed a good walker Oh yes\\nI should like to join you very much I am very fond of a long walk\\nAnne felt persuaded by the looks of the two girls that it was precisely\\nwhat they did not wish and admired again the sort of necessity\\nwhich the family habits seemed to produce of everything being\\nto be communicated and everything being to be done together\\nhowever undesired and inconvenient  She tried to dissuade Mary from going\\nbut in vain and that being the case thought it best to accept\\nthe Miss Musgroves much more cordial invitation to herself to go likewise\\nas she might be useful in turning back with her sister and lessening\\nthe interference in any plan of their own\\n\\nI cannot imagine why they should suppose I should not like a long walk\\nsaid Mary as she went up stairs  Everybody is always supposing\\nthat I am not a good walker and yet they would not have been pleased\\nif we had refused to join them  When people come in this manner\\non purpose to ask us how can one say no\\n\\nJust as they were setting off the gentlemen returned  They had taken out\\na young dog who had spoilt their sport and sent them back early\\nTheir time and strength and spirits were therefore exactly ready\\nfor this walk and they entered into it with pleasure  Could Anne\\nhave foreseen such a junction she would have staid at home but\\nfrom some feelings of interest and curiosity she fancied now that it was\\ntoo late to retract and the whole six set forward together\\nin the direction chosen by the Miss Musgroves who evidently\\nconsidered the walk as under their guidance\\n\\nAnnes object was not to be in the way of anybody and where\\nthe narrow paths across the fields made many separations necessary\\nto keep with her brother and sister  Her pleasure in the walk\\nmust arise from the exercise and the day from the view of\\nthe last smiles of the year upon the tawny leaves and withered hedges\\nand from repeating to herself some few of the thousand poetical\\ndescriptions extant of autumn that season of peculiar and\\ninexhaustible influence on the mind of taste and tenderness\\nthat season which had drawn from every poet worthy of being read\\nsome attempt at description or some lines of feeling\\nShe occupied her mind as much as possible in such like musings\\nand quotations but it was not possible that when within reach\\nof Captain Wentworths conversation with either of the Miss Musgroves\\nshe should not try to hear it yet she caught little very remarkable\\nIt was mere lively chat such as any young persons on an intimate footing\\nmight fall into  He was more engaged with Louisa than with Henrietta\\nLouisa certainly put more forward for his notice than her sister\\nThis distinction appeared to increase and there was one speech\\nof Louisas which struck her  After one of the many praises of the day\\nwhich were continually bursting forth Captain Wentworth added \\n\\nWhat glorious weather for the Admiral and my sister  They meant to take\\na long drive this morning perhaps we may hail them from\\nsome of these hills  They talked of coming into this side of the country\\nI wonder whereabouts they will upset today  Oh it does happen\\nvery often I assure you but my sister makes nothing of it\\nshe would as lieve be tossed out as not\\n\\nAh You make the most of it I know cried Louisa but if it were\\nreally so I should do just the same in her place  If I loved a man\\nas she loves the Admiral I would always be with him nothing should ever\\nseparate us and I would rather be overturned by him than driven safely\\nby anybody else\\n\\nIt was spoken with enthusiasm\\n\\nHad you cried he catching the same tone I honour you\\nAnd there was silence between them for a little while\\n\\nAnne could not immediately fall into a quotation again  The sweet scenes\\nof autumn were for a while put by unless some tender sonnet\\nfraught with the apt analogy of the declining year with declining\\nhappiness and the images of youth and hope and spring all gone together\\nblessed her memory  She roused herself to say as they struck by order\\ninto another path Is not this one of the ways to Winthrop\\nBut nobody heard or at least nobody answered her\\n\\nWinthrop however or its environsfor young men are sometimes\\nto be met with strolling about near homewas their destination\\nand after another half mile of gradual ascent through large enclosures\\nwhere the ploughs at work and the fresh made path spoke the farmer\\ncounteracting the sweets of poetical despondence and meaning\\nto have spring again they gained the summit of the most considerable hill\\nwhich parted Uppercross and Winthrop and soon commanded a full view\\nof the latter at the foot of the hill on the other side\\n\\nWinthrop without beauty and without dignity was stretched before them\\nan indifferent house standing low and hemmed in by the barns and\\nbuildings of a farmyard\\n\\nMary exclaimed Bless me here is Winthrop  I declare I had no idea\\nWell now I think we had better turn back I am excessively tired\\n\\nHenrietta conscious and ashamed and seeing no cousin Charles\\nwalking along any path or leaning against any gate was ready\\nto do as Mary wished but No said Charles Musgrove and No no\\ncried Louisa more eagerly and taking her sister aside seemed to be\\narguing the matter warmly\\n\\nCharles in the meanwhile was very decidedly declaring his resolution\\nof calling on his aunt now that he was so near and very evidently\\nthough more fearfully trying to induce his wife to go too\\nBut this was one of the points on which the lady shewed her strength\\nand when he recommended the advantage of resting herself a quarter\\nof an hour at Winthrop as she felt so tired she resolutely answered\\nOh no indeed walking up that hill again would do her more harm\\nthan any sitting down could do her good and in short\\nher look and manner declared that go she would not\\n\\nAfter a little succession of these sort of debates and consultations\\nit was settled between Charles and his two sisters that he\\nand Henrietta should just run down for a few minutes to see their aunt\\nand cousins while the rest of the party waited for them at the top\\nof the hill  Louisa seemed the principal arranger of the plan\\nand as she went a little way with them down the hill still talking\\nto Henrietta Mary took the opportunity of looking scornfully around her\\nand saying to Captain Wentworth\\n\\nIt is very unpleasant having such connexions  But I assure you\\nI have never been in the house above twice in my life\\n\\nShe received no other answer than an artificial assenting smile\\nfollowed by a contemptuous glance as he turned away which Anne\\nperfectly knew the meaning of\\n\\nThe brow of the hill where they remained was a cheerful spot\\nLouisa returned and Mary finding a comfortable seat for herself\\non the step of a stile was very well satisfied so long as the others\\nall stood about her but when Louisa drew Captain Wentworth away\\nto try for a gleaning of nuts in an adjoining hedgerow\\nand they were gone by degrees quite out of sight and sound\\nMary was happy no longer she quarrelled with her own seat\\nwas sure Louisa had got a much better somewhere and nothing could\\nprevent her from going to look for a better also  She turned through\\nthe same gate but could not see them  Anne found a nice seat\\nfor her on a dry sunny bank under the hedgerow in which\\nshe had no doubt of their still being in some spot or other\\nMary sat down for a moment but it would not do she was sure Louisa\\nhad found a better seat somewhere else and she would go on\\ntill she overtook her\\n\\nAnne really tired herself was glad to sit down and she very soon heard\\nCaptain Wentworth and Louisa in the hedgerow behind her as if\\nmaking their way back along the rough wild sort of channel down the\\ncentre  They were speaking as they drew near  Louisas voice was\\nthe first distinguished  She seemed to be in the middle of some\\neager speech  What Anne first heard was\\n\\nAnd so I made her go  I could not bear that she should be frightened\\nfrom the visit by such nonsense  What would I be turned back from\\ndoing a thing that I had determined to do and that I knew to be right\\nby the airs and interference of such a person or of any person I may say\\nNo I have no idea of being so easily persuaded  When I have\\nmade up my mind I have made it and Henrietta seemed entirely\\nto have made up hers to call at Winthrop today and yet she was as near\\ngiving it up out of nonsensical complaisance\\n\\nShe would have turned back then but for you\\n\\nShe would indeed  I am almost ashamed to say it\\n\\nHappy for her to have such a mind as yours at hand  After the hints\\nyou gave just now which did but confirm my own observations\\nthe last time I was in company with him  I need not affect\\nto have no comprehension of what is going on  I see that more than\\na mere dutiful morning visit to your aunt was in question\\nand woe betide him and her too when it comes to things of consequence\\nwhen they are placed in circumstances requiring fortitude and\\nstrength of mind if she have not resolution enough to resist\\nidle interference in such a trifle as this  Your sister is\\nan amiable creature but yours is the character of decision and firmness\\nI see  If you value her conduct or happiness infuse as much\\nof your own spirit into her as you can  But this no doubt\\nyou have been always doing  It is the worst evil of too yielding\\nand indecisive a character that no influence over it can be depended on\\nYou are never sure of a good impression being durable everybody\\nmay sway it  Let those who would be happy be firm  Here is a nut\\nsaid he catching one down from an upper bough  to exemplify\\na beautiful glossy nut which blessed with original strength\\nhas outlived all the storms of autumn  Not a puncture not\\na weak spot anywhere  This nut he continued with playful solemnity\\nwhile so many of his brethren have fallen and been trodden under foot\\nis still in possession of all the happiness that a hazel nut can be\\nsupposed capable of  Then returning to his former earnest tone\\nMy first wish for all whom I am interested in is that they should be firm\\nIf Louisa Musgrove would be beautiful and happy in her November of life\\nshe will cherish all her present powers of mind\\n\\nHe had done and was unanswered  It would have surprised Anne if Louisa\\ncould have readily answered such a speech  words of such interest\\nspoken with such serious warmth  She could imagine what Louisa was feeling\\nFor herself she feared to move lest she should be seen\\nWhile she remained a bush of low rambling holly protected her\\nand they were moving on  Before they were beyond her hearing\\nhowever Louisa spoke again\\n\\nMary is goodnatured enough in many respects said she\\nbut she does sometimes provoke me excessively by her nonsense\\nand pridethe Elliot pride  She has a great deal too much\\nof the Elliot pride  We do so wish that Charles had married Anne instead\\nI suppose you know he wanted to marry Anne\\n\\nAfter a moments pause Captain Wentworth said\\n\\nDo you mean that she refused him\\n\\nOh yes certainly\\n\\nWhen did that happen\\n\\nI do not exactly know for Henrietta and I were at school at the time\\nbut I believe about a year before he married Mary  I wish she had\\naccepted him  We should all have liked her a great deal better\\nand papa and mamma always think it was her great friend\\nLady Russells doing that she did not  They think Charles\\nmight not be learned and bookish enough to please Lady Russell\\nand that therefore she persuaded Anne to refuse him\\n\\nThe sounds were retreating and Anne distinguished no more\\nHer own emotions still kept her fixed  She had much to recover from\\nbefore she could move  The listeners proverbial fate was\\nnot absolutely hers she had heard no evil of herself but she had heard\\na great deal of very painful import  She saw how her own character\\nwas considered by Captain Wentworth and there had been just that degree\\nof feeling and curiosity about her in his manner which must give her\\nextreme agitation\\n\\nAs soon as she could she went after Mary and having found\\nand walked back with her to their former station by the stile\\nfelt some comfort in their whole party being immediately afterwards\\ncollected and once more in motion together  Her spirits wanted\\nthe solitude and silence which only numbers could give\\n\\nCharles and Henrietta returned bringing as may be conjectured\\nCharles Hayter with them  The minutiae of the business Anne\\ncould not attempt to understand even Captain Wentworth did not seem\\nadmitted to perfect confidence here but that there had been a withdrawing\\non the gentlemans side and a relenting on the ladys and that they\\nwere now very glad to be together again did not admit a doubt\\nHenrietta looked a little ashamed but very well pleased\\nCharles Hayter exceedingly happy  and they were devoted to each other\\nalmost from the first instant of their all setting forward for Uppercross\\n\\nEverything now marked out Louisa for Captain Wentworth\\nnothing could be plainer and where many divisions were necessary\\nor even where they were not they walked side by side nearly as much\\nas the other two  In a long strip of meadow land where there was\\nample space for all they were thus divided forming three distinct parties\\nand to that party of the three which boasted least animation\\nand least complaisance Anne necessarily belonged  She joined Charles\\nand Mary and was tired enough to be very glad of Charless other arm\\nbut Charles though in very good humour with her was out of temper\\nwith his wife  Mary had shewn herself disobliging to him\\nand was now to reap the consequence which consequence was\\nhis dropping her arm almost every moment to cut off the heads\\nof some nettles in the hedge with his switch and when Mary began\\nto complain of it and lament her being illused according to custom\\nin being on the hedge side while Anne was never incommoded on the other\\nhe dropped the arms of both to hunt after a weasel which he had\\na momentary glance of and they could hardly get him along at all\\n\\nThis long meadow bordered a lane which their footpath at the end of it\\nwas to cross and when the party had all reached the gate of exit\\nthe carriage advancing in the same direction which had been\\nsome time heard was just coming up and proved to be Admiral Crofts gig\\nHe and his wife had taken their intended drive and were returning home\\nUpon hearing how long a walk the young people had engaged in\\nthey kindly offered a seat to any lady who might be particularly tired\\nit would save her a full mile and they were going through Uppercross\\nThe invitation was general and generally declined  The Miss Musgroves\\nwere not at all tired and Mary was either offended by not being asked\\nbefore any of the others or what Louisa called the Elliot pride\\ncould not endure to make a third in a one horse chaise\\n\\nThe walking party had crossed the lane and were surmounting an\\nopposite stile and the Admiral was putting his horse in motion again\\nwhen Captain Wentworth cleared the hedge in a moment to say something\\nto his sister  The something might be guessed by its effects\\n\\nMiss Elliot I am sure you are tired cried Mrs Croft\\nDo let us have the pleasure of taking you home  Here is excellent room\\nfor three I assure you  If we were all like you I believe we might\\nsit four  You must indeed you must\\n\\nAnne was still in the lane and though instinctively beginning to decline\\nshe was not allowed to proceed  The Admirals kind urgency\\ncame in support of his wifes they would not be refused\\nthey compressed themselves into the smallest possible space\\nto leave her a corner and Captain Wentworth without saying a word\\nturned to her and quietly obliged her to be assisted into the carriage\\n\\nYes he had done it  She was in the carriage and felt that he had\\nplaced her there that his will and his hands had done it\\nthat she owed it to his perception of her fatigue and his resolution\\nto give her rest  She was very much affected by the view of\\nhis disposition towards her which all these things made apparent\\nThis little circumstance seemed the completion of all that had gone before\\nShe understood him  He could not forgive her but he could not\\nbe unfeeling  Though condemning her for the past and considering it\\nwith high and unjust resentment though perfectly careless of her\\nand though becoming attached to another still he could not see her suffer\\nwithout the desire of giving her relief  It was a remainder\\nof former sentiment it was an impulse of pure though unacknowledged\\nfriendship it was a proof of his own warm and amiable heart\\nwhich she could not contemplate without emotions so compounded\\nof pleasure and pain that she knew not which prevailed\\n\\nHer answers to the kindness and the remarks of her companions\\nwere at first unconsciously given  They had travelled half their way\\nalong the rough lane before she was quite awake to what they said\\nShe then found them talking of Frederick\\n\\nHe certainly means to have one or other of those two girls Sophy\\nsaid the Admiral but there is no saying which  He has been\\nrunning after them too long enough one would think to make up his mind\\nAy this comes of the peace  If it were war now he would have\\nsettled it long ago  We sailors Miss Elliot cannot afford to make\\nlong courtships in time of war  How many days was it my dear\\nbetween the first time of my seeing you and our sitting down together\\nin our lodgings at North Yarmouth\\n\\nWe had better not talk about it my dear replied Mrs Croft pleasantly\\nfor if Miss Elliot were to hear how soon we came to an understanding\\nshe would never be persuaded that we could be happy together\\nI had known you by character however long before\\n\\nWell and I had heard of you as a very pretty girl and what were we\\nto wait for besides  I do not like having such things so long in hand\\nI wish Frederick would spread a little more canvass and bring us home\\none of these young ladies to Kellynch  Then there would always\\nbe company for them  And very nice young ladies they both are\\nI hardly know one from the other\\n\\nVery good humoured unaffected girls indeed said Mrs Croft\\nin a tone of calmer praise such as made Anne suspect that\\nher keener powers might not consider either of them as quite worthy\\nof her brother and a very respectable family  One could not be\\nconnected with better people  My dear Admiral that post\\nwe shall certainly take that post\\n\\nBut by coolly giving the reins a better direction herself they happily\\npassed the danger and by once afterwards judiciously putting out\\nher hand they neither fell into a rut nor ran foul of a dungcart\\nand Anne with some amusement at their style of driving\\nwhich she imagined no bad representation of the general guidance\\nof their affairs found herself safely deposited by them at the Cottage\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 11\\n\\n\\nThe time now approached for Lady Russells return  the day was even fixed\\nand Anne being engaged to join her as soon as she was resettled\\nwas looking forward to an early removal to Kellynch and beginning\\nto think how her own comfort was likely to be affected by it\\n\\nIt would place her in the same village with Captain Wentworth\\nwithin half a mile of him they would have to frequent the same church\\nand there must be intercourse between the two families\\nThis was against her but on the other hand he spent so much of his time\\nat Uppercross that in removing thence she might be considered rather\\nas leaving him behind than as going towards him and upon the whole\\nshe believed she must on this interesting question be the gainer\\nalmost as certainly as in her change of domestic society\\nin leaving poor Mary for Lady Russell\\n\\nShe wished it might be possible for her to avoid ever seeing\\nCaptain Wentworth at the Hall  those rooms had witnessed\\nformer meetings which would be brought too painfully before her\\nbut she was yet more anxious for the possibility of Lady Russell and\\nCaptain Wentworth never meeting anywhere  They did not like each other\\nand no renewal of acquaintance now could do any good and were Lady Russell\\nto see them together she might think that he had too much selfpossession\\nand she too little\\n\\nThese points formed her chief solicitude in anticipating\\nher removal from Uppercross where she felt she had been stationed\\nquite long enough  Her usefulness to little Charles would always\\ngive some sweetness to the memory of her two months visit there\\nbut he was gaining strength apace and she had nothing else to stay for\\n\\nThe conclusion of her visit however was diversified in a way\\nwhich she had not at all imagined  Captain Wentworth after being unseen\\nand unheard of at Uppercross for two whole days appeared again among them\\nto justify himself by a relation of what had kept him away\\n\\nA letter from his friend Captain Harville having found him out at last\\nhad brought intelligence of Captain Harvilles being settled\\nwith his family at Lyme for the winter of their being therefore\\nquite unknowingly within twenty miles of each other  Captain Harville\\nhad never been in good health since a severe wound which he received\\ntwo years before and Captain Wentworths anxiety to see him\\nhad determined him to go immediately to Lyme  He had been there\\nfor fourandtwenty hours  His acquittal was complete\\nhis friendship warmly honoured a lively interest excited for his friend\\nand his description of the fine country about Lyme so feelingly attended to\\nby the party that an earnest desire to see Lyme themselves\\nand a project for going thither was the consequence\\n\\nThe young people were all wild to see Lyme  Captain Wentworth talked\\nof going there again himself it was only seventeen miles from Uppercross\\nthough November the weather was by no means bad and in short\\nLouisa who was the most eager of the eager having formed\\nthe resolution to go and besides the pleasure of doing as she liked\\nbeing now armed with the idea of merit in maintaining her own way\\nbore down all the wishes of her father and mother for putting it off\\ntill summer and to Lyme they were to goCharles Mary Anne Henrietta\\nLouisa and Captain Wentworth\\n\\nThe first heedless scheme had been to go in the morning and return at night\\nbut to this Mr Musgrove for the sake of his horses would not consent\\nand when it came to be rationally considered a day in\\nthe middle of November would not leave much time for seeing a new place\\nafter deducting seven hours as the nature of the country required\\nfor going and returning  They were consequently to stay the night there\\nand not to be expected back till the next days dinner  This was felt\\nto be a considerable amendment and though they all met at the Great House\\nat rather an early breakfast hour and set off very punctually\\nit was so much past noon before the two carriages Mr Musgroves coach\\ncontaining the four ladies and Charless curricle in which\\nhe drove Captain Wentworth were descending the long hill into Lyme\\nand entering upon the still steeper street of the town itself\\nthat it was very evident they would not have more than time\\nfor looking about them before the light and warmth of the day were gone\\n\\nAfter securing accommodations and ordering a dinner at one of the inns\\nthe next thing to be done was unquestionably to walk directly\\ndown to the sea  They were come too late in the year for any amusement\\nor variety which Lyme as a public place might offer  The rooms\\nwere shut up the lodgers almost all gone scarcely any family\\nbut of the residents left and as there is nothing to admire\\nin the buildings themselves the remarkable situation of the town\\nthe principal street almost hurrying into the water the walk to the Cobb\\nskirting round the pleasant little bay which in the season\\nis animated with bathing machines and company the Cobb itself\\nits old wonders and new improvements with the very beautiful\\nline of cliffs stretching out to the east of the town are what\\nthe strangers eye will seek and a very strange stranger it must be\\nwho does not see charms in the immediate environs of Lyme\\nto make him wish to know it better  The scenes in its neighbourhood\\nCharmouth with its high grounds and extensive sweeps of country\\nand still more its sweet retired bay backed by dark cliffs\\nwhere fragments of low rock among the sands make it the happiest spot\\nfor watching the flow of the tide for sitting in unwearied contemplation\\nthe woody varieties of the cheerful village of Up Lyme and above all\\nPinny with its green chasms between romantic rocks where\\nthe scattered forest trees and orchards of luxuriant growth\\ndeclare that many a generation must have passed away since the first\\npartial falling of the cliff prepared the ground for such a state\\nwhere a scene so wonderful and so lovely is exhibited as may\\nmore than equal any of the resembling scenes of the farfamed\\nIsle of Wight  these places must be visited and visited again\\nto make the worth of Lyme understood\\n\\nThe party from Uppercross passing down by the now deserted\\nand melancholy looking rooms and still descending soon found themselves\\non the seashore and lingering only as all must linger and gaze\\non a first return to the sea who ever deserved to look on it at all\\nproceeded towards the Cobb equally their object in itself\\nand on Captain Wentworths account  for in a small house\\nnear the foot of an old pier of unknown date were the Harvilles settled\\nCaptain Wentworth turned in to call on his friend the others walked on\\nand he was to join them on the Cobb\\n\\nThey were by no means tired of wondering and admiring and not even Louisa\\nseemed to feel that they had parted with Captain Wentworth long\\nwhen they saw him coming after them with three companions\\nall well known already by description to be Captain and Mrs Harville\\nand a Captain Benwick who was staying with them\\n\\nCaptain Benwick had some time ago been first lieutenant of the Laconia\\nand the account which Captain Wentworth had given of him\\non his return from Lyme before his warm praise of him as\\nan excellent young man and an officer whom he had always valued highly\\nwhich must have stamped him well in the esteem of every listener\\nhad been followed by a little history of his private life\\nwhich rendered him perfectly interesting in the eyes of all the ladies\\nHe had been engaged to Captain Harvilles sister and was now\\nmourning her loss  They had been a year or two waiting for fortune\\nand promotion  Fortune came his prizemoney as lieutenant being great\\npromotion too came at last but Fanny Harville did not live to know it\\nShe had died the preceding summer while he was at sea  Captain Wentworth\\nbelieved it impossible for man to be more attached to woman\\nthan poor Benwick had been to Fanny Harville or to be more deeply\\nafflicted under the dreadful change  He considered his disposition\\nas of the sort which must suffer heavily uniting very strong feelings\\nwith quiet serious and retiring manners and a decided taste for reading\\nand sedentary pursuits  To finish the interest of the story\\nthe friendship between him and the Harvilles seemed if possible\\naugmented by the event which closed all their views of alliance\\nand Captain Benwick was now living with them entirely  Captain Harville\\nhad taken his present house for half a year his taste and his health\\nand his fortune all directing him to a residence inexpensive\\nand by the sea and the grandeur of the country and the retirement\\nof Lyme in the winter appeared exactly adapted to Captain Benwicks\\nstate of mind  The sympathy and goodwill excited towards Captain Benwick\\nwas very great\\n\\nAnd yet said Anne to herself as they now moved forward\\nto meet the party he has not perhaps a more sorrowing heart\\nthan I have  I cannot believe his prospects so blighted for ever\\nHe is younger than I am younger in feeling if not in fact\\nyounger as a man  He will rally again and be happy with another\\n\\nThey all met and were introduced  Captain Harville was a tall\\ndark man with a sensible benevolent countenance a little lame\\nand from strong features and want of health looking much older\\nthan Captain Wentworth  Captain Benwick looked and was\\nthe youngest of the three and compared with either of them\\na little man  He had a pleasing face and a melancholy air\\njust as he ought to have and drew back from conversation\\n\\nCaptain Harville though not equalling Captain Wentworth in manners\\nwas a perfect gentleman unaffected warm and obliging\\nMrs Harville a degree less polished than her husband seemed however\\nto have the same good feelings and nothing could be more pleasant\\nthan their desire of considering the whole party as friends of their own\\nbecause the friends of Captain Wentworth or more kindly hospitable\\nthan their entreaties for their all promising to dine with them\\nThe dinner already ordered at the inn was at last though unwillingly\\naccepted as a excuse but they seemed almost hurt that Captain Wentworth\\nshould have brought any such party to Lyme without considering it\\nas a thing of course that they should dine with them\\n\\nThere was so much attachment to Captain Wentworth in all this\\nand such a bewitching charm in a degree of hospitality so uncommon\\nso unlike the usual style of giveandtake invitations and dinners\\nof formality and display that Anne felt her spirits not likely to be\\nbenefited by an increasing acquaintance among his brotherofficers\\nThese would have been all my friends was her thought\\nand she had to struggle against a great tendency to lowness\\n\\nOn quitting the Cobb they all went indoors with their new friends\\nand found rooms so small as none but those who invite from the heart\\ncould think capable of accommodating so many  Anne had\\na moments astonishment on the subject herself but it was soon lost\\nin the pleasanter feelings which sprang from the sight of all\\nthe ingenious contrivances and nice arrangements of Captain Harville\\nto turn the actual space to the best account to supply the deficiencies\\nof lodginghouse furniture and defend the windows and doors\\nagainst the winter storms to be expected  The varieties in\\nthe fittingup of the rooms where the common necessaries\\nprovided by the owner in the common indifferent plight\\nwere contrasted with some few articles of a rare species of wood\\nexcellently worked up and with something curious and valuable\\nfrom all the distant countries Captain Harville had visited\\nwere more than amusing to Anne connected as it all was with his profession\\nthe fruit of its labours the effect of its influence on his habits\\nthe picture of repose and domestic happiness it presented\\nmade it to her a something more or less than gratification\\n\\nCaptain Harville was no reader but he had contrived\\nexcellent accommodations and fashioned very pretty shelves\\nfor a tolerable collection of wellbound volumes the property of\\nCaptain Benwick  His lameness prevented him from taking much exercise\\nbut a mind of usefulness and ingenuity seemed to furnish him with\\nconstant employment within  He drew he varnished he carpentered\\nhe glued he made toys for the children he fashioned new nettingneedles\\nand pins with improvements and if everything else was done\\nsat down to his large fishingnet at one corner of the room\\n\\nAnne thought she left great happiness behind her when they\\nquitted the house and Louisa by whom she found herself walking\\nburst forth into raptures of admiration and delight on the character\\nof the navy their friendliness their brotherliness their openness\\ntheir uprightness protesting that she was convinced of sailors having\\nmore worth and warmth than any other set of men in England\\nthat they only knew how to live and they only deserved to be\\nrespected and loved\\n\\nThey went back to dress and dine and so well had the scheme\\nanswered already that nothing was found amiss though its being\\nso entirely out of season and the no thoroughfare of Lyme\\nand the no expectation of company had brought many apologies\\nfrom the heads of the inn\\n\\nAnne found herself by this time growing so much more hardened\\nto being in Captain Wentworths company than she had at first imagined\\ncould ever be that the sitting down to the same table with him now\\nand the interchange of the common civilities attending on it\\nthey never got beyond was become a mere nothing\\n\\nThe nights were too dark for the ladies to meet again till the morrow\\nbut Captain Harville had promised them a visit in the evening\\nand he came bringing his friend also which was more than\\nhad been expected it having been agreed that Captain Benwick\\nhad all the appearance of being oppressed by the presence of\\nso many strangers  He ventured among them again however\\nthough his spirits certainly did not seem fit for the mirth\\nof the party in general\\n\\nWhile Captains Wentworth and Harville led the talk on one side of the room\\nand by recurring to former days supplied anecdotes in abundance\\nto occupy and entertain the others it fell to Annes lot to be placed\\nrather apart with Captain Benwick and a very good impulse\\nof her nature obliged her to begin an acquaintance with him\\nHe was shy and disposed to abstraction but the engaging mildness of\\nher countenance and gentleness of her manners soon had their effect\\nand Anne was well repaid the first trouble of exertion\\nHe was evidently a young man of considerable taste in reading\\nthough principally in poetry and besides the persuasion of having\\ngiven him at least an evenings indulgence in the discussion of subjects\\nwhich his usual companions had probably no concern in she had the hope\\nof being of real use to him in some suggestions as to the duty and\\nbenefit of struggling against affliction which had naturally grown out\\nof their conversation  For though shy he did not seem reserved\\nit had rather the appearance of feelings glad to burst their\\nusual restraints and having talked of poetry the richness of\\nthe present age and gone through a brief comparison of opinion\\nas to the firstrate poets trying to ascertain whether Marmion\\nor The Lady of the Lake were to be preferred and how ranked the Giaour\\nand The Bride of Abydos and moreover how the Giaour was to be pronounced\\nhe showed himself so intimately acquainted with all the tenderest songs\\nof the one poet and all the impassioned descriptions of hopeless agony\\nof the other he repeated with such tremulous feeling the various lines\\nwhich imaged a broken heart or a mind destroyed by wretchedness\\nand looked so entirely as if he meant to be understood\\nthat she ventured to hope he did not always read only poetry\\nand to say that she thought it was the misfortune of poetry to be\\nseldom safely enjoyed by those who enjoyed it completely\\nand that the strong feelings which alone could estimate it truly\\nwere the very feelings which ought to taste it but sparingly\\n\\nHis looks shewing him not pained but pleased with this allusion\\nto his situation she was emboldened to go on and feeling in herself\\nthe right of seniority of mind she ventured to recommend\\na larger allowance of prose in his daily study and on being requested\\nto particularize mentioned such works of our best moralists\\nsuch collections of the finest letters such memoirs of characters\\nof worth and suffering as occurred to her at the moment\\nas calculated to rouse and fortify the mind by the highest precepts\\nand the strongest examples of moral and religious endurances\\n\\nCaptain Benwick listened attentively and seemed grateful for\\nthe interest implied and though with a shake of the head\\nand sighs which declared his little faith in the efficacy of any books\\non grief like his noted down the names of those she recommended\\nand promised to procure and read them\\n\\nWhen the evening was over Anne could not but be amused at the idea\\nof her coming to Lyme to preach patience and resignation to a young man\\nwhom she had never seen before nor could she help fearing\\non more serious reflection that like many other great moralists\\nand preachers she had been eloquent on a point in which her own conduct\\nwould ill bear examination\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 12\\n\\n\\nAnne and Henrietta finding themselves the earliest of the party\\nthe next morning agreed to stroll down to the sea before breakfast\\nThey went to the sands to watch the flowing of the tide\\nwhich a fine southeasterly breeze was bringing in with all the grandeur\\nwhich so flat a shore admitted  They praised the morning\\ngloried in the sea sympathized in the delight of the freshfeeling\\nbreezeand were silent till Henrietta suddenly began again with\\n\\nOh yesI am quite convinced that with very few exceptions\\nthe seaair always does good  There can be no doubt of its having been\\nof the greatest service to Dr Shirley after his illness\\nlast spring twelvemonth  He declares himself that coming to Lyme\\nfor a month did him more good than all the medicine he took\\nand that being by the sea always makes him feel young again\\nNow I cannot help thinking it a pity that he does not live\\nentirely by the sea  I do think he had better leave Uppercross entirely\\nand fix at Lyme  Do not you Anne  Do not you agree with me\\nthat it is the best thing he could do both for himself and Mrs Shirley\\nShe has cousins here you know and many acquaintance which would\\nmake it cheerful for her and I am sure she would be glad\\nto get to a place where she could have medical attendance at hand\\nin case of his having another seizure  Indeed I think it quite melancholy\\nto have such excellent people as Dr and Mrs Shirley who have been\\ndoing good all their lives wearing out their last days in a place\\nlike Uppercross where excepting our family they seem shut out\\nfrom all the world  I wish his friends would propose it to him\\nI really think they ought  And as to procuring a dispensation\\nthere could be no difficulty at his time of life and with his character\\nMy only doubt is whether anything could persuade him to leave his parish\\nHe is so very strict and scrupulous in his notions overscrupulous\\nI must say  Do not you think Anne it is being overscrupulous\\nDo not you think it is quite a mistaken point of conscience\\nwhen a clergyman sacrifices his health for the sake of duties\\nwhich may be just as well performed by another person  And at Lyme too\\nonly seventeen miles off he would be near enough to hear\\nif people thought there was anything to complain of\\n\\nAnne smiled more than once to herself during this speech\\nand entered into the subject as ready to do good by entering into\\nthe feelings of a young lady as of a young man though here it was good\\nof a lower standard for what could be offered but general acquiescence\\nShe said all that was reasonable and proper on the business\\nfelt the claims of Dr Shirley to repose as she ought saw how very\\ndesirable it was that he should have some active respectable young man\\nas a resident curate and was even courteous enough to hint at\\nthe advantage of such resident curates being married\\n\\nI wish said Henrietta very well pleased with her companion\\nI wish Lady Russell lived at Uppercross and were intimate\\nwith Dr Shirley  I have always heard of Lady Russell as a woman of\\nthe greatest influence with everybody  I always look upon her as able\\nto persuade a person to anything  I am afraid of her as I have\\ntold you before quite afraid of her because she is so very clever\\nbut I respect her amazingly and wish we had such a neighbour\\nat Uppercross\\n\\nAnne was amused by Henriettas manner of being grateful\\nand amused also that the course of events and the new interests\\nof Henriettas views should have placed her friend at all in favour\\nwith any of the Musgrove family she had only time however\\nfor a general answer and a wish that such another woman\\nwere at Uppercross before all subjects suddenly ceased\\non seeing Louisa and Captain Wentworth coming towards them\\nThey came also for a stroll till breakfast was likely to be ready\\nbut Louisa recollecting immediately afterwards that she had something\\nto procure at a shop invited them all to go back with her into the town\\nThey were all at her disposal\\n\\nWhen they came to the steps leading upwards from the beach a gentleman\\nat the same moment preparing to come down politely drew back\\nand stopped to give them way  They ascended and passed him\\nand as they passed Annes face caught his eye and he looked at her\\nwith a degree of earnest admiration which she could not be insensible of\\nShe was looking remarkably well her very regular very pretty features\\nhaving the bloom and freshness of youth restored by the fine wind\\nwhich had been blowing on her complexion and by the animation of eye\\nwhich it had also produced  It was evident that the gentleman\\ncompletely a gentleman in manner admired her exceedingly\\nCaptain Wentworth looked round at her instantly in a way which\\nshewed his noticing of it  He gave her a momentary glance\\na glance of brightness which seemed to say That man is struck with you\\nand even I at this moment see something like Anne Elliot again\\n\\nAfter attending Louisa through her business and loitering about\\na little longer they returned to the inn and Anne in passing afterwards\\nquickly from her own chamber to their diningroom had nearly run against\\nthe very same gentleman as he came out of an adjoining apartment\\nShe had before conjectured him to be a stranger like themselves\\nand determined that a welllooking groom who was strolling about\\nnear the two inns as they came back should be his servant\\nBoth master and man being in mourning assisted the idea\\nIt was now proved that he belonged to the same inn as themselves\\nand this second meeting short as it was also proved again\\nby the gentlemans looks that he thought hers very lovely\\nand by the readiness and propriety of his apologies that he was\\na man of exceedingly good manners  He seemed about thirty\\nand though not handsome had an agreeable person  Anne felt that\\nshe should like to know who he was\\n\\nThey had nearly done breakfast when the sound of a carriage\\nalmost the first they had heard since entering Lyme drew half the party\\nto the window  It was a gentlemans carriage a curricle\\nbut only coming round from the stableyard to the front door\\nsomebody must be going away  It was driven by a servant in mourning\\n\\nThe word curricle made Charles Musgrove jump up that he might\\ncompare it with his own the servant in mourning roused Annes curiosity\\nand the whole six were collected to look by the time the owner\\nof the curricle was to be seen issuing from the door amidst the bows\\nand civilities of the household and taking his seat to drive off\\n\\nAh cried Captain Wentworth instantly and with half a glance at Anne\\nit is the very man we passed\\n\\nThe Miss Musgroves agreed to it and having all kindly watched him\\nas far up the hill as they could they returned to the breakfast table\\nThe waiter came into the room soon afterwards\\n\\nPray said Captain Wentworth immediately can you tell us the name\\nof the gentleman who is just gone away\\n\\nYes Sir a Mr Elliot a gentleman of large fortune came in last night\\nfrom Sidmouth  Dare say you heard the carriage sir while you were\\nat dinner and going on now for Crewkherne in his way to Bath\\nand London\\n\\nElliot  Many had looked on each other and many had repeated the name\\nbefore all this had been got through even by the smart rapidity\\nof a waiter\\n\\nBless me cried Mary it must be our cousin it must be our Mr Elliot\\nit must indeed  Charles Anne must not it  In mourning you see\\njust as our Mr Elliot must be  How very extraordinary\\nIn the very same inn with us  Anne must not it be our Mr Elliot\\nmy fathers next heir  Pray sir turning to the waiter\\ndid not you hear did not his servant say whether he belonged\\nto the Kellynch family\\n\\nNo maam he did not mention no particular family but he said\\nhis master was a very rich gentleman and would be a baronight some day\\n\\nThere you see cried Mary in an ecstasy just as I said\\nHeir to Sir Walter Elliot  I was sure that would come out\\nif it was so  Depend upon it that is a circumstance which his servants\\ntake care to publish wherever he goes  But Anne only conceive\\nhow extraordinary  I wish I had looked at him more  I wish we had\\nbeen aware in time who it was that he might have been introduced to us\\nWhat a pity that we should not have been introduced to each other\\nDo you think he had the Elliot countenance  I hardly looked at him\\nI was looking at the horses but I think he had something\\nof the Elliot countenance I wonder the arms did not strike me\\nOh the greatcoat was hanging over the panel and hid the arms\\nso it did otherwise I am sure I should have observed them\\nand the livery too if the servant had not been in mourning\\none should have known him by the livery\\n\\nPutting all these very extraordinary circumstances together\\nsaid Captain Wentworth we must consider it to be the arrangement\\nof Providence that you should not be introduced to your cousin\\n\\nWhen she could command Marys attention Anne quietly tried\\nto convince her that their father and Mr Elliot had not for many years\\nbeen on such terms as to make the power of attempting an introduction\\nat all desirable\\n\\nAt the same time however it was a secret gratification to herself\\nto have seen her cousin and to know that the future owner of Kellynch\\nwas undoubtedly a gentleman and had an air of good sense\\nShe would not upon any account mention her having met with him\\nthe second time luckily Mary did not much attend to their having\\npassed close by him in their earlier walk but she would have felt\\nquite illused by Annes having actually run against him in the passage\\nand received his very polite excuses while she had never been\\nnear him at all no that cousinly little interview must remain\\na perfect secret\\n\\nOf course said Mary you will mention our seeing Mr Elliot\\nthe next time you write to Bath  I think my father certainly\\nought to hear of it do mention all about him\\n\\nAnne avoided a direct reply but it was just the circumstance\\nwhich she considered as not merely unnecessary to be communicated\\nbut as what ought to be suppressed  The offence which had been given\\nher father many years back she knew Elizabeths particular share in it\\nshe suspected and that Mr Elliots idea always produced irritation in both\\nwas beyond a doubt  Mary never wrote to Bath herself all the toil\\nof keeping up a slow and unsatisfactory correspondence with Elizabeth\\nfell on Anne\\n\\nBreakfast had not been long over when they were joined by Captain\\nand Mrs Harville and Captain Benwick with whom they had appointed\\nto take their last walk about Lyme  They ought to be setting off\\nfor Uppercross by one and in the mean while were to be all together\\nand out of doors as long as they could\\n\\nAnne found Captain Benwick getting near her as soon as they were all\\nfairly in the street  Their conversation the preceding evening\\ndid not disincline him to seek her again and they walked together\\nsome time talking as before of Mr Scott and Lord Byron\\nand still as unable as before and as unable as any other two readers\\nto think exactly alike of the merits of either till something\\noccasioned an almost general change amongst their party and instead of\\nCaptain Benwick she had Captain Harville by her side\\n\\nMiss Elliot said he speaking rather low you have done a good deed\\nin making that poor fellow talk so much  I wish he could have\\nsuch company oftener  It is bad for him I know to be shut up as he is\\nbut what can we do  We cannot part\\n\\nNo said Anne that I can easily believe to be impossible\\nbut in time perhapswe know what time does in every case of affliction\\nand you must remember Captain Harville that your friend\\nmay yet be called a young mourneronly last summer I understand\\n\\nAy true enough with a deep sigh only June\\n\\nAnd not known to him perhaps so soon\\n\\nNot till the first week of August when he came home from the Cape\\njust made into the Grappler  I was at Plymouth dreading to hear of him\\nhe sent in letters but the Grappler was under orders for Portsmouth\\nThere the news must follow him but who was to tell it not I\\nI would as soon have been run up to the yardarm  Nobody could do it\\nbut that good fellow pointing to Captain Wentworth  The Laconia\\nhad come into Plymouth the week before no danger of her\\nbeing sent to sea again  He stood his chance for the rest\\nwrote up for leave of absence but without waiting the return\\ntravelled night and day till he got to Portsmouth rowed off\\nto the Grappler that instant and never left the poor fellow for a week\\nThats what he did and nobody else could have saved poor James\\nYou may think Miss Elliot whether he is dear to us\\n\\nAnne did think on the question with perfect decision and said as much\\nin reply as her own feeling could accomplish or as his seemed\\nable to bear for he was too much affected to renew the subject\\nand when he spoke again it was of something totally different\\n\\nMrs Harvilles giving it as her opinion that her husband would have\\nquite walking enough by the time he reached home determined the direction\\nof all the party in what was to be their last walk they would\\naccompany them to their door and then return and set off themselves\\nBy all their calculations there was just time for this but as they drew\\nnear the Cobb there was such a general wish to walk along it once more\\nall were so inclined and Louisa soon grew so determined\\nthat the difference of a quarter of an hour it was found\\nwould be no difference at all so with all the kind leavetaking\\nand all the kind interchange of invitations and promises which\\nmay be imagined they parted from Captain and Mrs Harville\\nat their own door and still accompanied by Captain Benwick\\nwho seemed to cling to them to the last proceeded to make\\nthe proper adieus to the Cobb\\n\\nAnne found Captain Benwick again drawing near her  Lord Byrons\\ndark blue seas could not fail of being brought forward by\\ntheir present view and she gladly gave him all her attention as long as\\nattention was possible  It was soon drawn perforce another way\\n\\nThere was too much wind to make the high part of the new Cobb pleasant\\nfor the ladies and they agreed to get down the steps to the lower\\nand all were contented to pass quietly and carefully down the steep flight\\nexcepting Louisa she must be jumped down them by Captain Wentworth\\nIn all their walks he had had to jump her from the stiles\\nthe sensation was delightful to her  The hardness of the pavement\\nfor her feet made him less willing upon the present occasion\\nhe did it however  She was safely down and instantly\\nto show her enjoyment ran up the steps to be jumped down again\\nHe advised her against it thought the jar too great but no\\nhe reasoned and talked in vain she smiled and said I am determined\\nI will he put out his hands she was too precipitate by half a second\\nshe fell on the pavement on the Lower Cobb and was taken up lifeless\\nThere was no wound no blood no visible bruise but her eyes were closed\\nshe breathed not her face was like death  The horror of the moment\\nto all who stood around\\n\\nCaptain Wentworth who had caught her up knelt with her in his arms\\nlooking on her with a face as pallid as her own in an agony of silence\\nShe is dead she is dead screamed Mary catching hold of her\\nhusband and contributing with his own horror to make him immoveable\\nand in another moment Henrietta sinking under the conviction lost\\nher senses too and would have fallen on the steps but for Captain\\nBenwick and Anne who caught and supported her between them\\n\\nIs there no one to help me were the first words which\\nburst from Captain Wentworth in a tone of despair and as if\\nall his own strength were gone\\n\\nGo to him go to him cried Anne for heavens sake go to him\\nI can support her myself  Leave me and go to him  Rub her hands\\nrub her temples here are salts take them take them\\n\\nCaptain Benwick obeyed and Charles at the same moment\\ndisengaging himself from his wife they were both with him\\nand Louisa was raised up and supported more firmly between them\\nand everything was done that Anne had prompted but in vain\\nwhile Captain Wentworth staggering against the wall for his support\\nexclaimed in the bitterest agony\\n\\nOh God her father and mother\\n\\nA surgeon said Anne\\n\\nHe caught the word it seemed to rouse him at once and saying only\\nTrue true a surgeon this instant was darting away\\nwhen Anne eagerly suggested\\n\\nCaptain Benwick would not it be better for Captain Benwick\\nHe knows where a surgeon is to be found\\n\\nEvery one capable of thinking felt the advantage of the idea\\nand in a moment it was all done in rapid moments Captain Benwick had\\nresigned the poor corpselike  figure entirely to the brothers care\\nand was off for the town with the utmost rapidity\\n\\nAs to the wretched party left behind it could scarcely be said\\nwhich of the three who were completely rational was suffering most\\nCaptain Wentworth Anne or Charles who really a very affectionate\\nbrother hung over Louisa with sobs of grief and could only turn his eyes\\nfrom one sister to see the other in a state as insensible\\nor to witness the hysterical agitations of his wife calling on him\\nfor help which he could not give\\n\\nAnne attending with all the strength and zeal and thought\\nwhich instinct supplied to Henrietta still tried at intervals\\nto suggest comfort to the others tried to quiet Mary to animate Charles\\nto assuage the feelings of Captain Wentworth  Both seemed to look to her\\nfor directions\\n\\nAnne Anne cried Charles What is to be done next\\nWhat in heavens name is to be done next\\n\\nCaptain Wentworths eyes were also turned towards her\\n\\nHad not she better be carried to the inn  Yes I am sure\\ncarry her gently to the inn\\n\\nYes yes to the inn repeated Captain Wentworth comparatively\\ncollected and eager to be doing something  I will carry her myself\\nMusgrove take care of the others\\n\\nBy this time the report of the accident had spread among the workmen\\nand boatmen about the Cobb and many were collected near them\\nto be useful if wanted at any rate to enjoy the sight of\\na dead young lady nay two dead young ladies for it proved twice as fine\\nas the first report  To some of the bestlooking of these good people\\nHenrietta was consigned for though partially revived\\nshe was quite helpless and in this manner Anne walking by her side\\nand Charles attending to his wife they set forward treading back\\nwith feelings unutterable the ground which so lately so very lately\\nand so light of heart they had passed along\\n\\nThey were not off the Cobb before the Harvilles met them\\nCaptain Benwick had been seen flying by their house with a countenance\\nwhich showed something to be wrong and they had set off immediately\\ninformed and directed as they passed towards the spot\\nShocked as Captain Harville was he brought senses and nerves\\nthat could be instantly useful and a look between him and his wife\\ndecided what was to be done  She must be taken to their house\\nall must go to their house and await the surgeons arrival there\\nThey would not listen to scruples  he was obeyed they were all\\nbeneath his roof and while Louisa under Mrs Harvilles direction\\nwas conveyed up stairs and given possession of her own bed\\nassistance cordials restoratives were supplied by her husband\\nto all who needed them\\n\\nLouisa had once opened her eyes but soon closed them again\\nwithout apparent consciousness  This had been a proof of life\\nhowever of service to her sister and Henrietta though perfectly\\nincapable of being in the same room with Louisa was kept\\nby the agitation of hope and fear from a return of her own insensibility\\nMary too was growing calmer\\n\\nThe surgeon was with them almost before it had seemed possible\\nThey were sick with horror while he examined but he was not hopeless\\nThe head had received a severe contusion but he had seen greater injuries\\nrecovered from  he was by no means hopeless he spoke cheerfully\\n\\nThat he did not regard it as a desperate case that he did not say\\na few hours must end it was at first felt beyond the hope of most\\nand the ecstasy of such a reprieve the rejoicing deep and silent\\nafter a few fervent ejaculations of gratitude to Heaven had been offered\\nmay be conceived\\n\\nThe tone the look with which Thank God was uttered\\nby Captain Wentworth Anne was sure could never be forgotten by her\\nnor the sight of him afterwards as he sat near a table leaning over it\\nwith folded arms and face concealed as if overpowered by\\nthe various feelings of his soul and trying by prayer and reflection\\nto calm them\\n\\nLouisas limbs had escaped  There was no injury but to the head\\n\\nIt now became necessary for the party to consider what was best to be done\\nas to their general situation  They were now able to speak to each other\\nand consult  That Louisa must remain where she was however distressing\\nto her friends to be involving the Harvilles in such trouble\\ndid not admit a doubt  Her removal was impossible  The Harvilles\\nsilenced all scruples and as much as they could all gratitude\\nThey had looked forward and arranged everything before the others\\nbegan to reflect  Captain Benwick must give up his room to them\\nand get another bed elsewhere and the whole was settled\\nThey were only concerned that the house could accommodate no more\\nand yet perhaps by putting the children away in the maids room\\nor swinging a cot somewhere they could hardly bear to think of not\\nfinding room for two or three besides supposing they might wish to stay\\nthough with regard to any attendance on Miss Musgrove there need not be\\nthe least uneasiness in leaving her to Mrs Harvilles care entirely\\nMrs Harville was a very experienced nurse and her nurserymaid\\nwho had lived with her long and gone about with her everywhere\\nwas just such another  Between these two she could want\\nno possible attendance by day or night  And all this was said\\nwith a truth and sincerity of feeling irresistible\\n\\nCharles Henrietta and Captain Wentworth were the three in consultation\\nand for a little while it was only an interchange of perplexity and terror\\nUppercross the necessity of some ones going to Uppercross\\nthe news to be conveyed how it could be broken to Mr and Mrs Musgrove\\nthe lateness of the morning an hour already gone since they\\nought to have been off the impossibility of being in tolerable time\\nAt first they were capable of nothing more to the purpose\\nthan such exclamations but after a while Captain Wentworth\\nexerting himself said\\n\\nWe must be decided and without the loss of another minute\\nEvery minute is valuable  Some one must resolve on being off\\nfor Uppercross instantly  Musgrove either you or I must go\\n\\nCharles agreed but declared his resolution of not going away\\nHe would be as little incumbrance as possible to Captain and Mrs Harville\\nbut as to leaving his sister in such a state he neither ought nor would\\nSo far it was decided and Henrietta at first declared the same\\nShe however was soon persuaded to think differently  The usefulness\\nof her staying  She who had not been able to remain in Louisas room\\nor to look at her without sufferings which made her worse than helpless\\nShe was forced to acknowledge that she could do no good\\nyet was still unwilling to be away till touched by the thought\\nof her father and mother she gave it up she consented\\nshe was anxious to be at home\\n\\nThe plan had reached this point when Anne coming quietly\\ndown from Louisas room could not but hear what followed\\nfor the parlour door was open\\n\\nThen it is settled Musgrove cried Captain Wentworth\\nthat you stay and that I take care of your sister home\\nBut as to the rest as to the others if one stays to assist Mrs Harville\\nI think it need be only one  Mrs Charles Musgrove will of course\\nwish to get back to her children but if Anne will stay no one so proper\\nso capable as Anne\\n\\nShe paused a moment to recover from the emotion of hearing herself\\nso spoken of  The other two warmly agreed with what he said\\nand she then appeared\\n\\nYou will stay I am sure you will stay and nurse her cried he\\nturning to her and speaking with a glow and yet a gentleness\\nwhich seemed almost restoring the past  She coloured deeply\\nand he recollected himself and moved away  She expressed herself\\nmost willing ready happy to remain  It was what she had been\\nthinking of and wishing to be allowed to do  A bed on the floor\\nin Louisas room would be sufficient for her if Mrs Harville\\nwould but think so\\n\\nOne thing more and all seemed arranged  Though it was rather desirable\\nthat Mr and Mrs Musgrove should be previously alarmed by some\\nshare of delay yet the time required by the Uppercross horses\\nto take them back would be a dreadful extension of suspense\\nand Captain Wentworth proposed and Charles Musgrove agreed\\nthat it would be much better for him to take a chaise from the inn\\nand leave Mr Musgroves carriage and horses to be sent home\\nthe next morning early when there would be the farther advantage\\nof sending an account of Louisas night\\n\\nCaptain Wentworth now hurried off to get everything ready on his part\\nand to be soon followed by the two ladies  When the plan was\\nmade known to Mary however there was an end of all peace in it\\nShe was so wretched and so vehement complained so much of injustice\\nin being expected to go away instead of Anne Anne who was\\nnothing to Louisa while she was her sister and had the best right\\nto stay in Henriettas stead  Why was not she to be as useful as Anne\\nAnd to go home without Charles too without her husband\\nNo it was too unkind  And in short she said more than her husband\\ncould long withstand and as none of the others could oppose\\nwhen he gave way there was no help for it the change of Mary for Anne\\nwas inevitable\\n\\nAnne had never submitted more reluctantly to the jealous\\nand illjudging claims of Mary but so it must be and they set off\\nfor the town Charles taking care of his sister and Captain Benwick\\nattending to her  She gave a moments recollection as they hurried along\\nto the little circumstances which the same spots had witnessed\\nearlier in the morning  There she had listened to Henriettas schemes\\nfor Dr Shirleys leaving Uppercross farther on she had\\nfirst seen Mr Elliot a moment seemed all that could now be given\\nto any one but Louisa or those who were wrapt up in her welfare\\n\\nCaptain Benwick was most considerately attentive to her and\\nunited as they all seemed by the distress of the day she felt\\nan increasing degree of goodwill towards him and a pleasure even\\nin thinking that it might perhaps be the occasion of continuing\\ntheir acquaintance\\n\\nCaptain Wentworth was on the watch for them and a chaise and four in waiting\\nstationed for their convenience in the lowest part of the street\\nbut his evident surprise and vexation at the substitution of one sister\\nfor the other the change in his countenance the astonishment\\nthe expressions begun and suppressed with which Charles was listened to\\nmade but a mortifying reception of Anne or must at least convince her\\nthat she was valued only as she could be useful to Louisa\\n\\nShe endeavoured to be composed and to be just  Without emulating\\nthe feelings of an Emma towards her Henry she would have\\nattended on Louisa with a zeal above the common claims of regard\\nfor his sake and she hoped he would not long be so unjust\\nas to suppose she would shrink unnecessarily from the office of a friend\\n\\nIn the mean while she was in the carriage  He had handed them both in\\nand placed himself between them and in this manner under these\\ncircumstances full of astonishment and emotion to Anne she quitted Lyme\\nHow the long stage would pass how it was to affect their manners\\nwhat was to be their sort of intercourse she could not foresee\\nIt was all quite natural however  He was devoted to Henrietta\\nalways turning towards her and when he spoke at all always with the view\\nof supporting her hopes and raising her spirits  In general\\nhis voice and manner were studiously calm  To spare Henrietta\\nfrom agitation seemed the governing principle  Once only\\nwhen she had been grieving over the last illjudged illfated\\nwalk to the Cobb bitterly lamenting that it ever had been thought of\\nhe burst forth as if wholly overcome\\n\\nDont talk of it dont talk of it he cried  Oh God that I had\\nnot given way to her at the fatal moment  Had I done as I ought\\nBut so eager and so resolute Dear sweet Louisa\\n\\nAnne wondered whether it ever occurred to him now to question the justness\\nof his own previous opinion as to the universal felicity and advantage\\nof firmness of character and whether it might not strike him that\\nlike all other qualities of the mind it should have its proportions\\nand limits  She thought it could scarcely escape him to feel\\nthat a persuadable temper might sometimes be as much in favour of happiness\\nas a very resolute character\\n\\nThey got on fast  Anne was astonished to recognise the same hills\\nand the same objects so soon  Their actual speed heightened by\\nsome dread of the conclusion made the road appear but half as long\\nas on the day before  It was growing quite dusk however\\nbefore they were in the neighbourhood of Uppercross and there had been\\ntotal silence among them for some time Henrietta leaning back\\nin the corner with a shawl over her face giving the hope of her\\nhaving cried herself to sleep when as they were going up their last hill\\nAnne found herself all at once addressed by Captain Wentworth\\nIn a low cautious voice he said \\n\\nI have been considering what we had best do  She must not\\nappear at first  She could not stand it  I have been thinking whether\\nyou had not better remain in the carriage with her while I go in\\nand break it to Mr and Mrs Musgrove  Do you think this is a good plan\\n\\nShe did  he was satisfied and said no more  But the remembrance\\nof the appeal remained a pleasure to her as a proof of friendship\\nand of deference for her judgement a great pleasure and when it became\\na sort of parting proof its value did not lessen\\n\\nWhen the distressing communication at Uppercross was over\\nand he had seen the father and mother quite as composed as could be hoped\\nand the daughter all the better for being with them he announced\\nhis intention of returning in the same carriage to Lyme\\nand when the horses were baited he was off\\n\\nEnd of volume one\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 13\\n\\n\\nThe remainder of Annes time at Uppercross comprehending only two days\\nwas spent entirely at the Mansion House and she had the satisfaction\\nof knowing herself extremely useful there both as an immediate companion\\nand as assisting in all those arrangements for the future which\\nin Mr and Mrs Musgroves distressed state of spirits would have\\nbeen difficulties\\n\\nThey had an early account from Lyme the next morning  Louisa was\\nmuch the same  No symptoms worse than before had appeared\\nCharles came a few hours afterwards to bring a later and\\nmore particular account  He was tolerably cheerful  A speedy cure\\nmust not be hoped but everything was going on as well\\nas the nature of the case admitted  In speaking of the Harvilles\\nhe seemed unable to satisfy his own sense of their kindness\\nespecially of Mrs Harvilles exertions as a nurse  She really left\\nnothing for Mary to do  He and Mary had been persuaded to go early\\nto their inn last night  Mary had been hysterical again this morning\\nWhen he came away she was going to walk out with Captain Benwick\\nwhich he hoped would do her good  He almost wished she had been\\nprevailed on to come home the day before but the truth was\\nthat Mrs Harville left nothing for anybody to do\\n\\nCharles was to return to Lyme the same afternoon and his father\\nhad at first half a mind to go with him but the ladies could not consent\\nIt would be going only to multiply trouble to the others\\nand increase his own distress and a much better scheme followed\\nand was acted upon  A chaise was sent for from Crewkherne\\nand Charles conveyed back a far more useful person in the old nurserymaid\\nof the family one who having brought up all the children\\nand seen the very last the lingering and longpetted Master Harry\\nsent to school after his brothers was now living in her deserted nursery\\nto mend stockings and dress all the blains and bruises she could\\nget near her and who consequently was only too happy in being\\nallowed to go and help nurse dear Miss Louisa  Vague wishes of\\ngetting Sarah thither had occurred before to Mrs Musgrove and Henrietta\\nbut without Anne it would hardly have been resolved on\\nand found practicable so soon\\n\\nThey were indebted the next day to Charles Hayter for all\\nthe minute knowledge of Louisa which it was so essential to obtain\\nevery twentyfour hours  He made it his business to go to Lyme\\nand his account was still encouraging  The intervals of sense\\nand consciousness were believed to be stronger  Every report agreed\\nin Captain Wentworths appearing fixed in Lyme\\n\\nAnne was to leave them on the morrow an event which they all dreaded\\nWhat should they do without her  They were wretched comforters\\nfor one another  And so much was said in this way that Anne thought\\nshe could not do better than impart among them the general inclination\\nto which she was privy and persuaded them all to go to Lyme at once\\nShe had little difficulty it was soon determined that they would go\\ngo tomorrow fix themselves at the inn or get into lodgings\\nas it suited and there remain till dear Louisa could be moved\\nThey must be taking off some trouble from the good people she was with\\nthey might at least relieve Mrs Harville from the care of her own children\\nand in short they were so happy in the decision that Anne was delighted\\nwith what she had done and felt that she could not spend her\\nlast morning at Uppercross better than in assisting their preparations\\nand sending them off at an early hour though her being left\\nto the solitary range of the house was the consequence\\n\\nShe was the last excepting the little boys at the cottage\\nshe was the very last the only remaining one of all that had filled\\nand animated both houses of all that had given Uppercross\\nits cheerful character  A few days had made a change indeed\\n\\nIf Louisa recovered it would all be well again  More than\\nformer happiness would be restored  There could not be a doubt\\nto her mind there was none of what would follow her recovery\\nA few months hence and the room now so deserted occupied but by\\nher silent pensive self might be filled again with all that was happy\\nand gay all that was glowing and bright in prosperous love\\nall that was most unlike Anne Elliot\\n\\nAn hours complete leisure for such reflections as these\\non a dark November day a small thick rain almost blotting out\\nthe very few objects ever to be discerned from the windows was enough\\nto make the sound of Lady Russells carriage exceedingly welcome\\nand yet though desirous to be gone she could not quit the Mansion House\\nor look an adieu to the Cottage with its black dripping and\\ncomfortless veranda or even notice through the misty glasses\\nthe last humble tenements of the village without a saddened heart\\nScenes had passed in Uppercross which made it precious\\nIt stood the record of many sensations of pain once severe\\nbut now softened and of some instances of relenting feeling\\nsome breathings of friendship and reconciliation which could\\nnever be looked for again and which could never cease to be dear\\nShe left it all behind her all but the recollection that\\nsuch things had been\\n\\nAnne had never entered Kellynch since her quitting Lady Russells house\\nin September  It had not been necessary and the few occasions of\\nits being possible for her to go to the Hall she had contrived to evade\\nand escape from  Her first return was to resume her place in the modern\\nand elegant apartments of the Lodge and to gladden the eyes\\nof its mistress\\n\\nThere was some anxiety mixed with Lady Russells joy in meeting her\\nShe knew who had been frequenting Uppercross  But happily\\neither Anne was improved in plumpness and looks or Lady Russell\\nfancied her so and Anne in receiving her compliments on the occasion\\nhad the amusement of connecting them with the silent admiration\\nof her cousin and of hoping that she was to be blessed with\\na second spring of youth and beauty\\n\\nWhen they came to converse she was soon sensible of some mental change\\nThe subjects of which her heart had been full on leaving Kellynch\\nand which she had felt slighted and been compelled to smother\\namong the Musgroves were now become but of secondary interest\\nShe had lately lost sight even of her father and sister and Bath\\nTheir concerns had been sunk under those of Uppercross\\nand when Lady Russell reverted to their former hopes and fears\\nand spoke her satisfaction in the house in Camden Place\\nwhich had been taken and her regret that Mrs Clay should still\\nbe with them Anne would have been ashamed to have it known\\nhow much more she was thinking of Lyme and Louisa Musgrove\\nand all her acquaintance there how much more interesting to her\\nwas the home and the friendship of the Harvilles and Captain Benwick\\nthan her own fathers house in Camden Place or her own sisters intimacy\\nwith Mrs Clay  She was actually forced to exert herself\\nto meet Lady Russell with anything like the appearance of equal solicitude\\non topics which had by nature the first claim on her\\n\\nThere was a little awkwardness at first in their discourse\\non another subject  They must speak of the accident at Lyme\\nLady Russell had not been arrived five minutes the day before\\nwhen a full account of the whole had burst on her but still it must\\nbe talked of she must make enquiries she must regret the imprudence\\nlament the result and Captain Wentworths name must be mentioned by both\\nAnne was conscious of not doing it so well as Lady Russell\\nShe could not speak the name and look straight forward to\\nLady Russells eye till she had adopted the expedient of telling her\\nbriefly what she thought of the attachment between him and Louisa\\nWhen this was told his name distressed her no longer\\n\\nLady Russell had only to listen composedly and wish them happy\\nbut internally her heart revelled in angry pleasure in pleased contempt\\nthat the man who at twentythree had seemed to understand somewhat\\nof the value of an Anne Elliot should eight years afterwards\\nbe charmed by a Louisa Musgrove\\n\\nThe first three or four days passed most quietly with no circumstance\\nto mark them excepting the receipt of a note or two from Lyme\\nwhich found their way to Anne she could not tell how and brought\\na rather improving account of Louisa  At the end of that period\\nLady Russells politeness could repose no longer and the fainter\\nselfthreatenings of the past became in a decided tone\\nI must call on Mrs Croft I really must call upon her soon\\nAnne have you courage to go with me and pay a visit in that house\\nIt will be some trial to us both\\n\\nAnne did not shrink from it on the contrary she truly felt as she said\\nin observing\\n\\nI think you are very likely to suffer the most of the two\\nyour feelings are less reconciled to the change than mine\\nBy remaining in the neighbourhood I am become inured to it\\n\\nShe could have said more on the subject for she had in fact\\nso high an opinion of the Crofts and considered her father\\nso very fortunate in his tenants felt the parish to be so sure\\nof a good example and the poor of the best attention and relief\\nthat however sorry and ashamed for the necessity of the removal\\nshe could not but in conscience feel that they were gone\\nwho deserved not to stay and that Kellynch Hall had passed\\ninto better hands than its owners  These convictions must unquestionably\\nhave their own pain and severe was its kind but they precluded\\nthat pain which Lady Russell would suffer in entering the house again\\nand returning through the wellknown apartments\\n\\nIn such moments Anne had no power of saying to herself\\nThese rooms ought to belong only to us  Oh how fallen\\nin their destination  How unworthily occupied  An ancient family\\nto be so driven away  Strangers filling their place\\nNo except when she thought of her mother and remembered where\\nshe had been used to sit and preside she had no sigh of that description\\nto heave\\n\\nMrs Croft always met her with a kindness which gave her the pleasure\\nof fancying herself a favourite and on the present occasion\\nreceiving her in that house there was particular attention\\n\\nThe sad accident at Lyme was soon the prevailing topic\\nand on comparing their latest accounts of the invalid it appeared\\nthat each lady dated her intelligence from the same hour of yestermorn\\nthat Captain Wentworth had been in Kellynch yesterday the first time\\nsince the accident had brought Anne the last note which she had\\nnot been able to trace the exact steps of had staid a few hours\\nand then returned again to Lyme and without any present intention\\nof quitting it any more  He had enquired after her she found\\nparticularly had expressed his hope of Miss Elliots not being\\nthe worse for her exertions and had spoken of those exertions as great\\nThis was handsome and gave her more pleasure than almost anything else\\ncould have done\\n\\nAs to the sad catastrophe itself it could be canvassed only in one style\\nby a couple of steady sensible women whose judgements had to work\\non ascertained events and it was perfectly decided that it had been\\nthe consequence of much thoughtlessness and much imprudence\\nthat its effects were most alarming and that it was frightful to think\\nhow long Miss Musgroves recovery might yet be doubtful and how liable\\nshe would still remain to suffer from the concussion hereafter\\nThe Admiral wound it up summarily by exclaiming\\n\\nAy a very bad business indeed  A new sort of way this\\nfor a young fellow to be making love by breaking his mistresss head\\nis not it Miss Elliot  This is breaking a head and giving a plaster\\ntruly\\n\\nAdmiral Crofts manners were not quite of the tone to suit Lady Russell\\nbut they delighted Anne  His goodness of heart and simplicity\\nof character were irresistible\\n\\nNow this must be very bad for you said he suddenly rousing from\\na little reverie to be coming and finding us here  I had not\\nrecollected it before I declare but it must be very bad\\nBut now do not stand upon ceremony  Get up and go over all the rooms\\nin the house if you like it\\n\\nAnother time Sir I thank you not now\\n\\nWell whenever it suits you  You can slip in from the shrubbery\\nat any time and there you will find we keep our umbrellas hanging up\\nby that door  A good place is not it  But checking himself\\nyou will not think it a good place for yours were always kept\\nin the butlers room  Ay so it always is I believe\\nOne mans ways may be as good as anothers but we all like our own best\\nAnd so you must judge for yourself whether it would be better for you\\nto go about the house or not\\n\\nAnne finding she might decline it did so very gratefully\\n\\nWe have made very few changes either continued the Admiral\\nafter thinking a moment  Very few  We told you about the laundrydoor\\nat Uppercross  That has been a very great improvement\\nThe wonder was how any family upon earth could bear with the inconvenience\\nof its opening as it did so long  You will tell Sir Walter\\nwhat we have done and that Mr Shepherd thinks it the greatest improvement\\nthe house ever had  Indeed I must do ourselves the justice to say\\nthat the few alterations we have made have been all very much\\nfor the better  My wife should have the credit of them however\\nI have done very little besides sending away some of the large\\nlookingglasses from my dressingroom which was your fathers\\nA very good man and very much the gentleman I am sure\\nbut I should think Miss Elliot looking with serious reflection\\nI should think he must be rather a dressy man for his time of life\\nSuch a number of lookingglasses oh Lord there was no getting away\\nfrom ones self  So I got Sophy to lend me a hand and we soon\\nshifted their quarters and now I am quite snug with my\\nlittle shaving glass in one corner and another great thing\\nthat I never go near\\n\\nAnne amused in spite of herself was rather distressed for an answer\\nand the Admiral fearing he might not have been civil enough\\ntook up the subject again to say\\n\\nThe next time you write to your good father Miss Elliot\\npray give him my compliments and Mrs Crofts and say that we are\\nsettled here quite to our liking and have no fault at all to find\\nwith the place  The breakfastroom chimney smokes a little\\nI grant you but it is only when the wind is due north and blows hard\\nwhich may not happen three times a winter  And take it altogether\\nnow that we have been into most of the houses hereabouts and can judge\\nthere is not one that we like better than this  Pray say so\\nwith my compliments  He will be glad to hear it\\n\\nLady Russell and Mrs Croft were very well pleased with each other\\nbut the acquaintance which this visit began was fated not to proceed\\nfar at present for when it was returned the Crofts announced\\nthemselves to be going away for a few weeks to visit their connexions\\nin the north of the county and probably might not be at home again\\nbefore Lady Russell would be removing to Bath\\n\\nSo ended all danger to Anne of meeting Captain Wentworth at Kellynch Hall\\nor of seeing him in company with her friend  Everything was safe enough\\nand she smiled over the many anxious feelings she had wasted\\non the subject\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 14\\n\\n\\nThough Charles and Mary had remained at Lyme much longer after\\nMr and Mrs Musgroves going than Anne conceived they could have been\\nat all wanted they were yet the first of the family to be at home again\\nand as soon as possible after their return to Uppercross\\nthey drove over to the Lodge  They had left Louisa beginning to sit up\\nbut her head though clear was exceedingly weak and her nerves\\nsusceptible to the highest extreme of tenderness and though\\nshe might be pronounced to be altogether doing very well\\nit was still impossible to say when she might be able to bear\\nthe removal home and her father and mother who must return\\nin time to receive their younger children for the Christmas holidays\\nhad hardly a hope of being allowed to bring her with them\\n\\nThey had been all in lodgings together  Mrs Musgrove had\\ngot Mrs Harvilles children away as much as she could every possible\\nsupply from Uppercross had been furnished to lighten the inconvenience\\nto the Harvilles while the Harvilles had been wanting them\\nto come to dinner every day and in short it seemed to have been\\nonly a struggle on each side as to which should be most disinterested\\nand hospitable\\n\\nMary had had her evils but upon the whole as was evident\\nby her staying so long she had found more to enjoy than to suffer\\nCharles Hayter had been at Lyme oftener than suited her and when\\nthey dined with the Harvilles there had been only a maidservant to wait\\nand at first Mrs Harville had always given Mrs Musgrove precedence\\nbut then she had received so very handsome an apology from her\\non finding out whose daughter she was and there had been so much\\ngoing on every day there had been so many walks between their lodgings\\nand the Harvilles and she had got books from the library\\nand changed them so often that the balance had certainly been\\nmuch in favour of Lyme  She had been taken to Charmouth too\\nand she had bathed and she had gone to church and there were a great many\\nmore people to look at in the church at Lyme than at Uppercross\\nand all this joined to the sense of being so very useful\\nhad made really an agreeable fortnight\\n\\nAnne enquired after Captain Benwick Marys face was clouded directly\\nCharles laughed\\n\\nOh Captain Benwick is very well I believe but he is\\na very odd young man  I do not know what he would be at\\nWe asked him to come home with us for a day or two  Charles undertook\\nto give him some shooting and he seemed quite delighted and for my part\\nI thought it was all settled when behold on Tuesday night\\nhe made a very awkward sort of excuse he never shot and he had\\nbeen quite misunderstood and he had promised this and he had\\npromised that and the end of it was I found that he did not mean to come\\nI suppose he was afraid of finding it dull but upon my word\\nI should have thought we were lively enough at the Cottage\\nfor such a heartbroken man as Captain Benwick\\n\\nCharles laughed again and said Now Mary you know very well\\nhow it really was  It was all your doing turning to Anne\\nHe fancied that if he went with us he should find you close by\\nhe fancied everybody to be living in Uppercross and when he discovered\\nthat Lady Russell lived three miles off his heart failed him\\nand he had not courage to come  That is the fact upon my honour\\nMary knows it is\\n\\nBut Mary did not give into it very graciously whether from\\nnot considering Captain Benwick entitled by birth and situation\\nto be in love with an Elliot or from not wanting to believe\\nAnne a greater attraction to Uppercross than herself must be\\nleft to be guessed  Annes goodwill however was not to be lessened\\nby what she heard  She boldly acknowledged herself flattered\\nand continued her enquiries\\n\\nOh he talks of you cried Charles in such terms\\nMary interrupted him I declare Charles I never heard him\\nmention Anne twice all the time I was there  I declare Anne\\nhe never talks of you at all\\n\\nNo admitted Charles I do not know that he ever does in a general\\nway but however it is a very clear thing that he admires you exceedingly\\nHis head is full of some books that he is reading upon your recommendation\\nand he wants to talk to you about them he has found out something or other\\nin one of them which he thinksoh I cannot pretend to remember it\\nbut it was something very fineI overheard him telling Henrietta\\nall about it and then Miss Elliot was spoken of in the highest terms\\nNow Mary I declare it was so I heard it myself and you were\\nin the other room  Elegance sweetness beauty Oh there was no end\\nof Miss Elliots charms\\n\\nAnd I am sure cried Mary warmly it was a very little to his credit\\nif he did  Miss Harville only died last June  Such a heart\\nis very little worth having is it Lady Russell  I am sure\\nyou will agree with me\\n\\nI must see Captain Benwick before I decide said Lady Russell smiling\\n\\nAnd that you are very likely to do very soon I can tell you maam\\nsaid Charles  Though he had not nerves for coming away with us\\nand setting off again afterwards to pay a formal visit here\\nhe will make his way over to Kellynch one day by himself\\nyou may depend on it  I told him the distance and the road\\nand I told him of the churchs being so very well worth seeing\\nfor as he has a taste for those sort of things I thought that would\\nbe a good excuse and he listened with all his understanding and soul\\nand I am sure from his manner that you will have him calling here soon\\nSo I give you notice Lady Russell\\n\\nAny acquaintance of Annes will always be welcome to me\\nwas Lady Russells kind answer\\n\\nOh as to being Annes acquaintance said Mary I think he is rather\\nmy acquaintance for I have been seeing him every day this last fortnight\\n\\nWell as your joint acquaintance then I shall be very happy\\nto see Captain Benwick\\n\\nYou will not find anything very agreeable in him I assure you maam\\nHe is one of the dullest young men that ever lived  He has walked with me\\nsometimes from one end of the sands to the other without saying a word\\nHe is not at all a wellbred young man  I am sure you will not like him\\n\\nThere we differ Mary said Anne  I think Lady Russell would like him\\nI think she would be so much pleased with his mind that she would\\nvery soon see no deficiency in his manner\\n\\nSo do I Anne said Charles  I am sure Lady Russell would like him\\nHe is just Lady Russells sort  Give him a book and he will\\nread all day long\\n\\nYes that he will exclaimed Mary tauntingly  He will sit poring\\nover his book and not know when a person speaks to him or when one\\ndrops ones scissors or anything that happens  Do you think\\nLady Russell would like that\\n\\nLady Russell could not help laughing  Upon my word said she\\nI should not have supposed that my opinion of any one could have\\nadmitted of such difference of conjecture steady and matter of fact\\nas I may call myself  I have really a curiosity to see the person\\nwho can give occasion to such directly opposite notions\\nI wish he may be induced to call here  And when he does Mary\\nyou may depend upon hearing my opinion but I am determined\\nnot to judge him beforehand\\n\\nYou will not like him I will answer for it\\n\\nLady Russell began talking of something else  Mary spoke with animation\\nof their meeting with or rather missing Mr Elliot so extraordinarily\\n\\nHe is a man said Lady Russell whom I have no wish to see\\nHis declining to be on cordial terms with the head of his family\\nhas left a very strong impression in his disfavour with me\\n\\nThis decision checked Marys eagerness and stopped her short\\nin the midst of the Elliot countenance\\n\\nWith regard to Captain Wentworth though Anne hazarded no enquiries\\nthere was voluntary communication sufficient  His spirits had been\\ngreatly recovering lately as might be expected  As Louisa improved\\nhe had improved and he was now quite a different creature\\nfrom what he had been the first week  He had not seen Louisa\\nand was so extremely fearful of any ill consequence to her\\nfrom an interview that he did not press for it at all and\\non the contrary seemed to have a plan of going away for a week\\nor ten days till her head was stronger  He had talked of going\\ndown to Plymouth for a week and wanted to persuade Captain Benwick\\nto go with him but as Charles maintained to the last Captain Benwick\\nseemed much more disposed to ride over to Kellynch\\n\\nThere can be no doubt that Lady Russell and Anne were both\\noccasionally thinking of Captain Benwick from this time\\nLady Russell could not hear the doorbell without feeling that it might\\nbe his herald nor could Anne return from any stroll of solitary indulgence\\nin her fathers grounds or any visit of charity in the village\\nwithout wondering whether she might see him or hear of him\\nCaptain Benwick came not however  He was either less disposed for it\\nthan Charles had imagined or he was too shy and after giving him\\na weeks indulgence Lady Russell determined him to be unworthy\\nof the interest which he had been beginning to excite\\n\\nThe Musgroves came back to receive their happy boys and girls from school\\nbringing with them Mrs Harvilles little children to improve the noise\\nof Uppercross and lessen that of Lyme  Henrietta remained with Louisa\\nbut all the rest of the family were again in their usual quarters\\n\\nLady Russell and Anne paid their compliments to them once\\nwhen Anne could not but feel that Uppercross was already quite alive again\\nThough neither Henrietta nor Louisa nor Charles Hayter\\nnor Captain Wentworth were there the room presented as strong a contrast\\nas could be wished to the last state she had seen it in\\n\\nImmediately surrounding Mrs Musgrove were the little Harvilles\\nwhom she was sedulously guarding from the tyranny of the two children\\nfrom the Cottage expressly arrived to amuse them  On one side\\nwas a table occupied by some chattering girls cutting up silk\\nand gold paper and on the other were tressels and trays\\nbending under the weight of brawn and cold pies where riotous boys\\nwere holding high revel the whole completed by a roaring Christmas fire\\nwhich seemed determined to be heard in spite of all the noise\\nof the others  Charles and Mary also came in of course\\nduring their visit and Mr Musgrove made a point of paying his respects\\nto Lady Russell and sat down close to her for ten minutes\\ntalking with a very raised voice but from the clamour of the children\\non his knees generally in vain  It was a fine familypiece\\n\\nAnne judging from her own temperament would have deemed\\nsuch a domestic hurricane a bad restorative of the nerves\\nwhich Louisas illness must have so greatly shaken  But Mrs Musgrove\\nwho got Anne near her on purpose to thank her most cordially\\nagain and again for all her attentions to them concluded\\na short recapitulation of what she had suffered herself by observing\\nwith a happy glance round the room that after all she had gone through\\nnothing was so likely to do her good as a little quiet cheerfulness\\nat home\\n\\nLouisa was now recovering apace  Her mother could even think of her\\nbeing able to join their party at home before her brothers and sisters\\nwent to school again  The Harvilles had promised to come with her\\nand stay at Uppercross whenever she returned  Captain Wentworth was gone\\nfor the present to see his brother in Shropshire\\n\\nI hope I shall remember in future said Lady Russell as soon as\\nthey were reseated in the carriage not to call at Uppercross\\nin the Christmas holidays\\n\\nEverybody has their taste in noises as well as in other matters\\nand sounds are quite innoxious or most distressing by their sort\\nrather than their quantity  When Lady Russell not long afterwards\\nwas entering Bath on a wet afternoon and driving through\\nthe long course of streets from the Old Bridge to Camden Place\\namidst the dash of other carriages the heavy rumble of carts and drays\\nthe bawling of newspapermen muffinmen and milkmen and the ceaseless\\nclink of pattens she made no complaint  No these were noises\\nwhich belonged to the winter pleasures her spirits rose\\nunder their influence and like Mrs Musgrove she was feeling\\nthough not saying that after being long in the country nothing could be\\nso good for her as a little quiet cheerfulness\\n\\nAnne did not share these feelings  She persisted in a very determined\\nthough very silent disinclination for Bath caught the first dim view\\nof the extensive buildings smoking in rain without any wish\\nof seeing them better felt their progress through the streets to be\\nhowever disagreeable yet too rapid for who would be glad to see her\\nwhen she arrived  And looked back with fond regret to the bustles\\nof Uppercross and the seclusion of Kellynch\\n\\nElizabeths last letter had communicated a piece of news of some interest\\nMr Elliot was in Bath  He had called in Camden Place had called\\na second time a third had been pointedly attentive  If Elizabeth\\nand her father did not deceive themselves had been taking much pains\\nto seek the acquaintance and proclaim the value of the connection\\nas he had formerly taken pains to shew neglect  This was very wonderful\\nif it were true and Lady Russell was in a state of very agreeable\\ncuriosity and perplexity about Mr Elliot already recanting the sentiment\\nshe had so lately expressed to Mary of his being a man whom she had\\nno wish to see  She had a great wish to see him  If he really sought\\nto reconcile himself like a dutiful branch he must be forgiven\\nfor having dismembered himself from the paternal tree\\n\\nAnne was not animated to an equal pitch by the circumstance\\nbut she felt that she would rather see Mr Elliot again than not\\nwhich was more than she could say for many other persons in Bath\\n\\nShe was put down in Camden Place and Lady Russell then drove\\nto her own lodgings in Rivers Street\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 15\\n\\n\\nSir Walter had taken a very good house in Camden Place\\na lofty dignified situation such as becomes a man of consequence\\nand both he and Elizabeth were settled there much to their satisfaction\\n\\nAnne entered it with a sinking heart anticipating an imprisonment\\nof many months and anxiously saying to herself Oh when shall I\\nleave you again  A degree of unexpected cordiality however\\nin the welcome she received did her good  Her father and sister\\nwere glad to see her for the sake of shewing her the house and furniture\\nand met her with kindness  Her making a fourth when they\\nsat down to dinner was noticed as an advantage\\n\\nMrs Clay was very pleasant and very smiling but her courtesies and smiles\\nwere more a matter of course  Anne had always felt that she would\\npretend what was proper on her arrival but the complaisance of the others\\nwas unlooked for  They were evidently in excellent spirits\\nand she was soon to listen to the causes  They had no inclination\\nto listen to her  After laying out for some compliments of being\\ndeeply regretted in their old neighbourhood which Anne could not pay\\nthey had only a few faint enquiries to make before the talk must be\\nall their own  Uppercross excited no interest Kellynch very little\\nit was all Bath\\n\\nThey had the pleasure of assuring her that Bath more than answered\\ntheir expectations in every respect  Their house was undoubtedly\\nthe best in Camden Place their drawingrooms had many decided advantages\\nover all the others which they had either seen or heard of\\nand the superiority was not less in the style of the fittingup\\nor the taste of the furniture  Their acquaintance was\\nexceedingly sought after  Everybody was wanting to visit them\\nThey had drawn back from many introductions and still were\\nperpetually having cards left by people of whom they knew nothing\\n\\nHere were funds of enjoyment  Could Anne wonder that her father\\nand sister were happy  She might not wonder but she must sigh\\nthat her father should feel no degradation in his change should see\\nnothing to regret in the duties and dignity of the resident landholder\\nshould find so much to be vain of in the littlenesses of a town\\nand she must sigh and smile and wonder too as Elizabeth threw open\\nthe foldingdoors and walked with exultation from one drawingroom\\nto the other boasting of their space at the possibility of that woman\\nwho had been mistress of Kellynch Hall finding extent to be proud of\\nbetween two walls perhaps thirty feet asunder\\n\\nBut this was not all which they had to make them happy\\nThey had Mr Elliot too  Anne had a great deal to hear of Mr Elliot\\nHe was not only pardoned they were delighted with him\\nHe had been in Bath about a fortnight he had passed through Bath\\nin November in his way to London when the intelligence of\\nSir Walters being settled there had of course reached him\\nthough only twentyfour hours in the place but he had not been able\\nto avail himself of it but he had now been a fortnight in Bath\\nand his first object on arriving had been to leave his card\\nin Camden Place following it up by such assiduous endeavours to meet\\nand when they did meet by such great openness of conduct\\nsuch readiness to apologize for the past such solicitude to be received\\nas a relation again that their former good understanding\\nwas completely reestablished\\n\\nThey had not a fault to find in him  He had explained away\\nall the appearance of neglect on his own side  It had originated\\nin misapprehension entirely  He had never had an idea of\\nthrowing himself off he had feared that he was thrown off\\nbut knew not why and delicacy had kept him silent  Upon the hint\\nof having spoken disrespectfully or carelessly of the family\\nand the family honours he was quite indignant  He who had ever boasted\\nof being an Elliot and whose feelings as to connection\\nwere only too strict to suit the unfeudal tone of the present day\\nHe was astonished indeed but his character and general conduct\\nmust refute it  He could refer Sir Walter to all who knew him\\nand certainly the pains he had been taking on this the first opportunity\\nof reconciliation to be restored to the footing of a relation\\nand heirpresumptive was a strong proof of his opinions on the subject\\n\\nThe circumstances of his marriage too were found to admit of\\nmuch extenuation  This was an article not to be entered on by himself\\nbut a very intimate friend of his a Colonel Wallis a highly\\nrespectable man perfectly the gentleman and not an illlooking man\\nSir Walter added who was living in very good style in Marlborough\\nBuildings and had at his own particular request been admitted\\nto their acquaintance through Mr Elliot had mentioned one or two things\\nrelative to the marriage which made a material difference\\nin the discredit of it\\n\\nColonel Wallis had known Mr Elliot long had been well acquainted\\nalso with his wife had perfectly understood the whole story\\nShe was certainly not a woman of family but well educated\\naccomplished rich and excessively in love with his friend\\nThere had been the charm  She had sought him  Without that attraction\\nnot all her money would have tempted Elliot and Sir Walter was\\nmoreover assured of her having been a very fine woman\\nHere was a great deal to soften the business  A very fine woman\\nwith a large fortune in love with him  Sir Walter seemed to admit it\\nas complete apology and though Elizabeth could not see the circumstance\\nin quite so favourable a light she allowed it be a great extenuation\\n\\nMr Elliot had called repeatedly had dined with them once\\nevidently delighted by the distinction of being asked for they\\ngave no dinners in general delighted in short by every proof\\nof cousinly notice and placing his whole happiness in being\\non intimate terms in Camden Place\\n\\nAnne listened but without quite understanding it  Allowances\\nlarge allowances she knew must be made for the ideas of those who spoke\\nShe heard it all under embellishment  All that sounded extravagant\\nor irrational in the progress of the reconciliation might have no origin\\nbut in the language of the relators  Still however she had\\nthe sensation of there being something more than immediately appeared\\nin Mr Elliots wishing after an interval of so many years\\nto be well received by them  In a worldly view he had nothing to gain\\nby being on terms with Sir Walter nothing to risk by a state of variance\\nIn all probability he was already the richer of the two\\nand the Kellynch estate would as surely be his hereafter as the title\\nA sensible man and he had looked like a very sensible man\\nwhy should it be an object to him  She could only offer one solution\\nit was perhaps for Elizabeths sake  There might really have been\\na liking formerly though convenience and accident had drawn him\\na different way and now that he could afford to please himself\\nhe might mean to pay his addresses to her  Elizabeth was certainly\\nvery handsome with wellbred elegant manners and her character\\nmight never have been penetrated by Mr Elliot knowing her but in public\\nand when very young himself  How her temper and understanding\\nmight bear the investigation of his present keener time of life\\nwas another concern and rather a fearful one  Most earnestly did she wish\\nthat he might not be too nice or too observant if Elizabeth\\nwere his object and that Elizabeth was disposed to believe herself so\\nand that her friend Mrs Clay was encouraging the idea seemed apparent\\nby a glance or two between them while Mr Elliots frequent visits\\nwere talked of\\n\\nAnne mentioned the glimpses she had had of him at Lyme but without\\nbeing much attended to  Oh yes perhaps it had been Mr Elliot\\nThey did not know  It might be him perhaps  They could not listen\\nto her description of him  They were describing him themselves\\nSir Walter especially  He did justice to his very gentlemanlike\\nappearance his air of elegance and fashion his good shaped face\\nhis sensible eye but at the same time must lament his being\\nvery much underhung a defect which time seemed to have increased\\nnor could he pretend to say that ten years had not altered\\nalmost every feature for the worse  Mr Elliot appeared to think\\nthat he Sir Walter was looking exactly as he had done when\\nthey last parted but Sir Walter had not been able to return\\nthe compliment entirely which had embarrassed him  He did not mean\\nto complain however  Mr Elliot was better to look at than most men\\nand he had no objection to being seen with him anywhere\\n\\nMr Elliot and his friends in Marlborough Buildings were talked of\\nthe whole evening  Colonel Wallis had been so impatient to be\\nintroduced to them and Mr Elliot so anxious that he should\\nand there was a Mrs Wallis at present known only to them by description\\nas she was in daily expectation of her confinement but Mr Elliot\\nspoke of her as a most charming woman quite worthy of being known\\nin Camden Place and as soon as she recovered they were to be acquainted\\nSir Walter thought much of Mrs Wallis she was said to be\\nan excessively pretty woman beautiful  He longed to see her\\nHe hoped she might make some amends for the many very plain faces\\nhe was continually passing in the streets  The worst of Bath was\\nthe number of its plain women  He did not mean to say that there were\\nno pretty women but the number of the plain was out of all proportion\\nHe had frequently observed as he walked that one handsome face\\nwould be followed by thirty or fiveandthirty frights and once\\nas he had stood in a shop on Bond Street he had counted\\neightyseven women go by one after another without there being\\na tolerable face among them  It had been a frosty morning\\nto be sure a sharp frost which hardly one woman in a thousand\\ncould stand the test of  But still there certainly were\\na dreadful multitude of ugly women in Bath and as for the men\\nthey were infinitely worse  Such scarecrows as the streets were full of\\nIt was evident how little the women were used to the sight of anything\\ntolerable by the effect which a man of decent appearance produced\\nHe had never walked anywhere arminarm with Colonel Wallis\\nwho was a fine military figure though sandyhaired without observing\\nthat every womans eye was upon him every womans eye was sure to be\\nupon Colonel Wallis  Modest Sir Walter  He was not allowed\\nto escape however  His daughter and Mrs Clay united in hinting\\nthat Colonel Walliss companion might have as good a figure\\nas Colonel Wallis and certainly was not sandyhaired\\n\\nHow is Mary looking said Sir Walter in the height of his good humour\\nThe last time I saw her she had a red nose but I hope that may not\\nhappen every day\\n\\nOh no that must have been quite accidental  In general she has been\\nin very good health and very good looks since Michaelmas\\n\\nIf I thought it would not tempt her to go out in sharp winds\\nand grow coarse I would send her a new hat and pelisse\\n\\nAnne was considering whether she should venture to suggest that a gown\\nor a cap would not be liable to any such misuse when a knock at the door\\nsuspended everything  A knock at the door and so late\\nIt was ten oclock  Could it be Mr Elliot  They knew he was to dine\\nin Lansdown Crescent  It was possible that he might stop in his way home\\nto ask them how they did  They could think of no one else\\nMrs Clay decidedly thought it Mr Elliots knock  Mrs Clay was right\\nWith all the state which a butler and footboy could give\\nMr Elliot was ushered into the room\\n\\nIt was the same the very same man with no difference but of dress\\nAnne drew a little back while the others received his compliments\\nand her sister his apologies for calling at so unusual an hour\\nbut he could not be so near without wishing to know that neither she\\nnor her friend had taken cold the day before c c which was\\nall as politely done and as politely taken as possible but her part\\nmust follow then  Sir Walter talked of his youngest daughter\\nMr Elliot must give him leave to present him to his youngest daughter\\nthere was no occasion for remembering Mary and Anne smiling and\\nblushing very becomingly shewed to Mr Elliot the pretty features\\nwhich he had by no means forgotten and instantly saw with amusement\\nat his little start of surprise that he had not been at all aware\\nof who she was  He looked completely astonished but not more astonished\\nthan pleased his eyes brightened and with the most perfect alacrity\\nhe welcomed the relationship alluded to the past and entreated\\nto be received as an acquaintance already  He was quite as goodlooking\\nas he had appeared at Lyme his countenance improved by speaking\\nand his manners were so exactly what they ought to be so polished\\nso easy so particularly agreeable that she could compare them\\nin excellence to only one persons manners  They were not the same\\nbut they were perhaps equally good\\n\\nHe sat down with them and improved their conversation very much\\nThere could be no doubt of his being a sensible man  Ten minutes\\nwere enough to certify that  His tone his expressions\\nhis choice of subject his knowing where to stop it was all\\nthe operation of a sensible discerning mind  As soon as he could\\nhe began to talk to her of Lyme wanting to compare opinions\\nrespecting the place but especially wanting to speak of the circumstance\\nof their happening to be guests in the same inn at the same time\\nto give his own route understand something of hers and regret that\\nhe should have lost such an opportunity of paying his respects to her\\nShe gave him a short account of her party and business at Lyme\\nHis regret increased as he listened  He had spent his whole\\nsolitary evening in the room adjoining theirs had heard voices\\nmirth continually thought they must be a most delightful set of people\\nlonged to be with them but certainly without the smallest suspicion\\nof his possessing the shadow of a right to introduce himself\\nIf he had but asked who the party were  The name of Musgrove would\\nhave told him enough  Well it would serve to cure him of\\nan absurd practice of never asking a question at an inn\\nwhich he had adopted when quite a young man on the principal\\nof its being very ungenteel to be curious\\n\\nThe notions of a young man of one or two and twenty said he\\nas to what is necessary in manners to make him quite the thing\\nare more absurd I believe than those of any other set of beings\\nin the world  The folly of the means they often employ\\nis only to be equalled by the folly of what they have in view\\n\\nBut he must not be addressing his reflections to Anne alone\\nhe knew it he was soon diffused again among the others\\nand it was only at intervals that he could return to Lyme\\n\\nHis enquiries however produced at length an account of the scene\\nshe had been engaged in there soon after his leaving the place\\nHaving alluded to an accident  he must hear the whole\\nWhen he questioned Sir Walter and Elizabeth began to question also\\nbut the difference in their manner of doing it could not be unfelt\\nShe could only compare Mr Elliot to Lady Russell in the wish\\nof really comprehending what had passed and in the degree of concern\\nfor what she must have suffered in witnessing it\\n\\nHe staid an hour with them  The elegant little clock on the mantel\\npiece had struck eleven with its silver sounds and the watchman\\nwas beginning to be heard at a distance telling the same tale\\nbefore Mr Elliot or any of them seemed to feel that he had been there long\\n\\nAnne could not have supposed it possible that her first evening in\\nCamden Place could have passed so well\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 16\\n\\n\\nThere was one point which Anne on returning to her family\\nwould have been more thankful to ascertain even than Mr Elliots\\nbeing in love with Elizabeth which was her fathers not being\\nin love with Mrs Clay and she was very far from easy about it\\nwhen she had been at home a few hours  On going down to breakfast\\nthe next morning she found there had just been a decent pretence\\non the ladys side of meaning to leave them  She could imagine Mrs Clay\\nto have said that now Miss Anne was come she could not suppose herself\\nat all wanted for Elizabeth was replying in a sort of whisper\\nThat must not be any reason indeed  I assure you I feel it none\\nShe is nothing to me compared with you  and she was in full time\\nto hear her father say My dear madam this must not be  As yet\\nyou have seen nothing of Bath  You have been here only to be useful\\nYou must not run away from us now  You must stay to be acquainted\\nwith Mrs Wallis the beautiful Mrs Wallis  To your fine mind\\nI well know the sight of beauty is a real gratification\\n\\nHe spoke and looked so much in earnest that Anne was not surprised\\nto see Mrs Clay stealing a glance at Elizabeth and herself\\nHer countenance perhaps might express some watchfulness\\nbut the praise of the fine mind did not appear to excite a thought\\nin her sister  The lady could not but yield to such joint entreaties\\nand promise to stay\\n\\nIn the course of the same morning Anne and her father chancing to be\\nalone together he began to compliment her on her improved looks\\nhe thought her less thin in her person in her cheeks her skin\\nher complexion greatly improved clearer fresher  Had she been\\nusing any thing in particular  No nothing  Merely Gowland\\nhe supposed  No nothing at all  Ha he was surprised at that\\nand added certainly you cannot do better than to continue as you are\\nyou cannot be better than well or I should recommend Gowland\\nthe constant use of Gowland during the spring months  Mrs Clay has been\\nusing it at my recommendation and you see what it has done for her\\nYou see how it has carried away her freckles\\n\\nIf Elizabeth could but have heard this  Such personal praise\\nmight have struck her especially as it did not appear to Anne\\nthat the freckles were at all lessened  But everything must\\ntake its chance  The evil of a marriage would be much diminished\\nif Elizabeth were also to marry  As for herself she might always\\ncommand a home with Lady Russell\\n\\nLady Russells composed mind and polite manners were put to some trial\\non this point in her intercourse in Camden Place  The sight of Mrs Clay\\nin such favour and of Anne so overlooked was a perpetual provocation\\nto her there and vexed her as much when she was away as a person in Bath\\nwho drinks the water gets all the new publications and has\\na very large acquaintance has time to be vexed\\n\\nAs Mr Elliot became known to her she grew more charitable\\nor more indifferent towards the others  His manners were\\nan immediate recommendation and on conversing with him she found\\nthe solid so fully supporting the superficial that she was at first\\nas she told Anne almost ready to exclaim Can this be Mr Elliot\\nand could not seriously picture to herself a more agreeable\\nor estimable man  Everything united in him good understanding\\ncorrect opinions knowledge of the world and a warm heart\\nHe had strong feelings of family attachment and family honour\\nwithout pride or weakness he lived with the liberality of a man of fortune\\nwithout display he judged for himself in everything essential\\nwithout defying public opinion in any point of worldly decorum\\nHe was steady observant moderate candid never run away with by spirits\\nor by selfishness which fancied itself strong feeling and yet\\nwith a sensibility to what was amiable and lovely and a value\\nfor all the felicities of domestic life which characters of\\nfancied enthusiasm and violent agitation seldom really possess\\nShe was sure that he had not been happy in marriage  Colonel Wallis\\nsaid it and Lady Russell saw it but it had been no unhappiness\\nto sour his mind nor she began pretty soon to suspect to prevent his\\nthinking of a second choice  Her satisfaction in Mr Elliot\\noutweighed all the plague of Mrs Clay\\n\\nIt was now some years since Anne had begun to learn that she\\nand her excellent friend could sometimes think differently\\nand it did not surprise her therefore that Lady Russell\\nshould see nothing suspicious or inconsistent nothing to require\\nmore motives than appeared in Mr Elliots great desire of a reconciliation\\nIn Lady Russells view it was perfectly natural that Mr Elliot\\nat a mature time of life should feel it a most desirable object\\nand what would very generally recommend him among all sensible people\\nto be on good terms with the head of his family the simplest process\\nin the world of time upon a head naturally clear and only erring\\nin the heyday of youth  Anne presumed however still to smile about it\\nand at last to mention Elizabeth  Lady Russell listened and looked\\nand made only this cautious replyElizabeth very well\\ntime will explain\\n\\nIt was a reference to the future which Anne after a little observation\\nfelt she must submit to  She could determine nothing at present\\nIn that house Elizabeth must be first and she was in the habit\\nof such general observance as Miss Elliot that any particularity\\nof attention seemed almost impossible  Mr Elliot too\\nit must be remembered had not been a widower seven months\\nA little delay on his side might be very excusable  In fact\\nAnne could never see the crape round his hat without fearing that\\nshe was the inexcusable one in attributing to him such imaginations\\nfor though his marriage had not been very happy still it had existed\\nso many years that she could not comprehend a very rapid recovery\\nfrom the awful impression of its being dissolved\\n\\nHowever it might end he was without any question their\\npleasantest acquaintance in Bath  she saw nobody equal to him\\nand it was a great indulgence now and then to talk to him about Lyme\\nwhich he seemed to have as lively a wish to see again and to see more of\\nas herself  They went through the particulars of their first meeting\\na great many times  He gave her to understand that he had\\nlooked at her with some earnestness  She knew it well\\nand she remembered another persons look also\\n\\nThey did not always think alike  His value for rank and connexion\\nshe perceived was greater than hers  It was not merely complaisance\\nit must be a liking to the cause which made him enter warmly\\ninto her father and sisters solicitudes on a subject which\\nshe thought unworthy to excite them  The Bath paper one morning\\nannounced the arrival of the Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple\\nand her daughter the Honourable Miss Carteret and all the comfort\\nof No Camden Place was swept away for many days for the Dalrymples\\nin Annes opinion most unfortunately were cousins of the Elliots\\nand the agony was how to introduce themselves properly\\n\\nAnne had never seen her father and sister before in contact with nobility\\nand she must acknowledge herself disappointed  She had hoped\\nbetter things from their high ideas of their own situation in life\\nand was reduced to form a wish which she had never foreseen\\na wish that they had more pride for our cousins Lady Dalrymple\\nand Miss Carteret our cousins the Dalrymples sounded in her ears\\nall day long\\n\\nSir Walter had once been in company with the late viscount\\nbut had never seen any of the rest of the family and the difficulties\\nof the case arose from there having been a suspension of all intercourse\\nby letters of ceremony ever since the death of that said late viscount\\nwhen in consequence of a dangerous illness of Sir Walters\\nat the same time there had been an unlucky omission at Kellynch\\nNo letter of condolence had been sent to Ireland  The neglect\\nhad been visited on the head of the sinner for when poor Lady Elliot\\ndied herself no letter of condolence was received at Kellynch\\nand consequently there was but too much reason to apprehend\\nthat the Dalrymples considered the relationship as closed\\nHow to have this anxious business set to rights and be admitted\\nas cousins again was the question  and it was a question which\\nin a more rational manner neither Lady Russell nor Mr Elliot\\nthought unimportant  Family connexions were always worth preserving\\ngood company always worth seeking Lady Dalrymple had taken a house\\nfor three months in Laura Place and would be living in style\\nShe had been at Bath the year before and Lady Russell had heard her\\nspoken of as a charming woman  It was very desirable that\\nthe connexion should be renewed if it could be done without any\\ncompromise of propriety on the side of the Elliots\\n\\nSir Walter however would choose his own means and at last wrote\\na very fine letter of ample explanation regret and entreaty\\nto his right honourable cousin  Neither Lady Russell nor Mr Elliot\\ncould admire the letter but it did all that was wanted\\nin bringing three lines of scrawl from the Dowager Viscountess\\nShe was very much honoured and should be happy in their acquaintance\\nThe toils of the business were over the sweets began  They visited\\nin Laura Place they had the cards of Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple\\nand the Honourable Miss Carteret to be arranged wherever they might\\nbe most visible  and Our cousins in Laura PlaceOur cousin\\nLady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret were talked of to everybody\\n\\nAnne was ashamed  Had Lady Dalrymple and her daughter even been\\nvery agreeable she would still have been ashamed of the agitation\\nthey created but they were nothing  There was no superiority of manner\\naccomplishment or understanding  Lady Dalrymple had acquired\\nthe name of a charming woman because she had a smile and a civil answer\\nfor everybody  Miss Carteret with still less to say was so plain\\nand so awkward that she would never have been tolerated in Camden Place\\nbut for her birth\\n\\nLady Russell confessed she had expected something better but yet\\nit was an acquaintance worth having and when Anne ventured to speak\\nher opinion of them to Mr Elliot he agreed to their being nothing\\nin themselves but still maintained that as a family connexion\\nas good company as those who would collect good company around them\\nthey had their value  Anne smiled and said\\n\\nMy idea of good company Mr Elliot is the company of clever\\nwellinformed people who have a great deal of conversation\\nthat is what I call good company\\n\\nYou are mistaken said he gently that is not good company\\nthat is the best  Good company requires only birth education\\nand manners and with regard to education is not very nice\\nBirth and good manners are essential but a little learning is\\nby no means a dangerous thing in good company on the contrary\\nit will do very well  My cousin Anne shakes her head\\nShe is not satisfied  She is fastidious  My dear cousin\\nsitting down by her you have a better right to be fastidious\\nthan almost any other woman I know but will it answer\\nWill it make you happy  Will it not be wiser to accept the society\\nof those good ladies in Laura Place and enjoy all the advantages\\nof the connexion as far as possible  You may depend upon it\\nthat they will move in the first set in Bath this winter\\nand as rank is rank your being known to be related to them\\nwill have its use in fixing your family our family let me say\\nin that degree of consideration which we must all wish for\\n\\nYes sighed Anne we shall indeed be known to be related to them\\nthen recollecting herself and not wishing to be answered she added\\nI certainly do think there has been by far too much trouble taken\\nto procure the acquaintance  I suppose smiling I have more pride\\nthan any of you but I confess it does vex me that we should be\\nso solicitous to have the relationship acknowledged which we may\\nbe very sure is a matter of perfect indifference to them\\n\\nPardon me dear cousin you are unjust in your own claims\\nIn London perhaps in your present quiet style of living\\nit might be as you say  but in Bath Sir Walter Elliot and his family\\nwill always be worth knowing  always acceptable as acquaintance\\n\\nWell said Anne I certainly am proud too proud to enjoy a welcome\\nwhich depends so entirely upon place\\n\\nI love your indignation said he it is very natural\\nBut here you are in Bath and the object is to be established here\\nwith all the credit and dignity which ought to belong to Sir Walter Elliot\\nYou talk of being proud I am called proud I know and I shall not wish\\nto believe myself otherwise for our pride if investigated\\nwould have the same object I have no doubt though the kind may seem\\na little different  In one point I am sure my dear cousin\\nhe continued speaking lower though there was no one else in the room\\nin one point I am sure we must feel alike  We must feel that\\nevery addition to your fathers society among his equals or superiors\\nmay be of use in diverting his thoughts from those who are beneath him\\n\\nHe looked as he spoke to the seat which Mrs Clay had been\\nlately occupying  a sufficient explanation of what he particularly meant\\nand though Anne could not believe in their having the same sort of pride\\nshe was pleased with him for not liking Mrs Clay and her conscience\\nadmitted that his wishing to promote her fathers getting\\ngreat acquaintance was more than excusable in the view of defeating her\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 17\\n\\n\\nWhile Sir Walter and Elizabeth were assiduously pushing their\\ngood fortune in Laura Place Anne was renewing an acquaintance\\nof a very different description\\n\\nShe had called on her former governess and had heard from her\\nof there being an old schoolfellow in Bath who had the two strong claims\\non her attention of past kindness and present suffering  Miss Hamilton\\nnow Mrs Smith had shewn her kindness in one of those periods of her life\\nwhen it had been most valuable  Anne had gone unhappy to school\\ngrieving for the loss of a mother whom she had dearly loved\\nfeeling her separation from home and suffering as a girl of fourteen\\nof strong sensibility and not high spirits must suffer at such a time\\nand Miss Hamilton three years older than herself but still from the want\\nof near relations and a settled home remaining another year at school\\nhad been useful and good to her in a way which had considerably lessened\\nher misery and could never be remembered with indifference\\n\\nMiss Hamilton had left school had married not long afterwards\\nwas said to have married a man of fortune and this was all\\nthat Anne had known of her till now that their governesss account\\nbrought her situation forward in a more decided but very different form\\n\\nShe was a widow and poor  Her husband had been extravagant\\nand at his death about two years before had left his affairs\\ndreadfully involved  She had had difficulties of every sort\\nto contend with and in addition to these distresses had been afflicted\\nwith a severe rheumatic fever which finally settling in her legs\\nhad made her for the present a cripple  She had come to Bath\\non that account and was now in lodgings near the hot baths\\nliving in a very humble way unable even to afford herself\\nthe comfort of a servant and of course almost excluded from society\\n\\nTheir mutual friend answered for the satisfaction which a visit\\nfrom Miss Elliot would give Mrs Smith and Anne therefore\\nlost no time in going  She mentioned nothing of what she had heard\\nor what she intended at home  It would excite no proper interest there\\nShe only consulted Lady Russell who entered thoroughly into her sentiments\\nand was most happy to convey her as near to Mrs Smiths lodgings\\nin Westgate Buildings as Anne chose to be taken\\n\\nThe visit was paid their acquaintance reestablished their interest\\nin each other more than rekindled  The first ten minutes\\nhad its awkwardness and its emotion  Twelve years were gone\\nsince they had parted and each presented a somewhat different person\\nfrom what the other had imagined  Twelve years had changed Anne\\nfrom the blooming silent unformed girl of fifteen to the elegant\\nlittle woman of sevenandtwenty with every beauty except bloom\\nand with manners as consciously right as they were invariably gentle\\nand twelve years had transformed the finelooking wellgrown Miss Hamilton\\nin all the glow of health and confidence of superiority into a poor\\ninfirm helpless widow receiving the visit of her former protegee\\nas a favour but all that was uncomfortable in the meeting had soon\\npassed away and left only the interesting charm of remembering\\nformer partialities and talking over old times\\n\\nAnne found in Mrs Smith the good sense and agreeable manners which\\nshe had almost ventured to depend on and a disposition to converse\\nand be cheerful beyond her expectation  Neither the dissipations\\nof the pastand she had lived very much in the worldnor the restrictions\\nof the present neither sickness nor sorrow seemed to have\\nclosed her heart or ruined her spirits\\n\\nIn the course of a second visit she talked with great openness\\nand Annes astonishment increased  She could scarcely imagine\\na more cheerless situation in itself than Mrs Smiths  She had been\\nvery fond of her husband  she had buried him  She had been\\nused to affluence  it was gone  She had no child to connect her\\nwith life and happiness again no relations to assist in the arrangement\\nof perplexed affairs no health to make all the rest supportable\\nHer accommodations were limited to a noisy parlour and a dark bedroom\\nbehind with no possibility of moving from one to the other without\\nassistance which there was only one servant in the house to afford\\nand she never quitted the house but to be conveyed into the warm bath\\nYet in spite of all this Anne had reason to believe that she had\\nmoments only of languor and depression to hours of occupation\\nand enjoyment  How could it be  She watched observed reflected\\nand finally determined that this was not a case of fortitude\\nor of resignation only  A submissive spirit might be patient\\na strong understanding would supply resolution but here was something more\\nhere was that elasticity of mind that disposition to be comforted\\nthat power of turning readily from evil to good and of finding employment\\nwhich carried her out of herself which was from nature alone\\nIt was the choicest gift of Heaven and Anne viewed her friend\\nas one of those instances in which by a merciful appointment\\nit seems designed to counterbalance almost every other want\\n\\nThere had been a time Mrs Smith told her when her spirits\\nhad nearly failed  She could not call herself an invalid now\\ncompared with her state on first reaching Bath  Then she had indeed\\nbeen a pitiable object for she had caught cold on the journey\\nand had hardly taken possession of her lodgings before she was again\\nconfined to her bed and suffering under severe and constant pain\\nand all this among strangers with the absolute necessity of having\\na regular nurse and finances at that moment particularly unfit\\nto meet any extraordinary expense  She had weathered it however\\nand could truly say that it had done her good  It had increased\\nher comforts by making her feel herself to be in good hands\\nShe had seen too much of the world to expect sudden or disinterested\\nattachment anywhere but her illness had proved to her that her landlady\\nhad a character to preserve and would not use her ill and she had been\\nparticularly fortunate in her nurse as a sister of her landlady\\na nurse by profession and who had always a home in that house\\nwhen unemployed chanced to be at liberty just in time to attend her\\nAnd she said Mrs Smith besides nursing me most admirably\\nhas really proved an invaluable acquaintance  As soon as I could\\nuse my hands she taught me to knit which has been a great amusement\\nand she put me in the way of making these little threadcases\\npincushions and cardracks which you always find me so busy about\\nand which supply me with the means of doing a little good\\nto one or two very poor families in this neighbourhood\\nShe had a large acquaintance of course professionally among those\\nwho can afford to buy and she disposes of my merchandise\\nShe always takes the right time for applying  Everybodys heart is open\\nyou know when they have recently escaped from severe pain\\nor are recovering the blessing of health and Nurse Rooke\\nthoroughly understands when to speak  She is a shrewd intelligent\\nsensible woman  Hers is a line for seeing human nature and she has\\na fund of good sense and observation which as a companion make her\\ninfinitely superior to thousands of those who having only received\\nthe best education in the world know nothing worth attending to\\nCall it gossip if you will but when Nurse Rooke has half an hours\\nleisure to bestow on me she is sure to have something to relate\\nthat is entertaining and profitable  something that makes one\\nknow ones species better  One likes to hear what is going on\\nto be au fait as to the newest modes of being trifling and silly\\nTo me who live so much alone her conversation I assure you is a treat\\n\\nAnne far from wishing to cavil at the pleasure replied\\nI can easily believe it  Women of that class have great opportunities\\nand if they are intelligent may be well worth listening to\\nSuch varieties of human nature as they are in the habit of witnessing\\nAnd it is not merely in its follies that they are well read\\nfor they see it occasionally under every circumstance that can be\\nmost interesting or affecting  What instances must pass before them\\nof ardent disinterested selfdenying attachment of heroism fortitude\\npatience resignation  of all the conflicts and all the sacrifices\\nthat ennoble us most  A sick chamber may often furnish\\nthe worth of volumes\\n\\nYes said Mrs Smith more doubtingly sometimes it may\\nthough I fear its lessons are not often in the elevated style you describe\\nHere and there human nature may be great in times of trial\\nbut generally speaking it is its weakness and not its strength\\nthat appears in a sick chamber  it is selfishness and impatience\\nrather than generosity and fortitude that one hears of\\nThere is so little real friendship in the world and unfortunately\\nspeaking low and tremulously there are so many who forget\\nto think seriously till it is almost too late\\n\\nAnne saw the misery of such feelings  The husband had not been\\nwhat he ought and the wife had been led among that part of mankind\\nwhich made her think worse of the world than she hoped it deserved\\nIt was but a passing emotion however with Mrs Smith she shook it off\\nand soon added in a different tone\\n\\nI do not suppose the situation my friend Mrs Rooke is in at present\\nwill furnish much either to interest or edify me  She is only nursing\\nMrs Wallis of Marlborough Buildings a mere pretty silly expensive\\nfashionable woman I believe and of course will have nothing to report\\nbut of lace and finery  I mean to make my profit of Mrs Wallis however\\nShe has plenty of money and I intend she shall buy all\\nthe highpriced things I have in hand now\\n\\nAnne had called several times on her friend before the existence\\nof such a person was known in Camden Place  At last it became necessary\\nto speak of her Sir Walter Elizabeth and Mrs Clay returned one morning\\nfrom Laura Place with a sudden invitation from Lady Dalrymple\\nfor the same evening and Anne was already engaged to spend that evening\\nin Westgate Buildings  She was not sorry for the excuse\\nThey were only asked she was sure because Lady Dalrymple being\\nkept at home by a bad cold was glad to make use of the relationship\\nwhich had been so pressed on her and she declined on her own account\\nwith great alacrityShe was engaged to spend the evening\\nwith an old schoolfellow  They were not much interested in anything\\nrelative to Anne but still there were questions enough asked\\nto make it understood what this old schoolfellow was and Elizabeth\\nwas disdainful and Sir Walter severe\\n\\nWestgate Buildings said he and who is Miss Anne Elliot\\nto be visiting in Westgate Buildings  A Mrs Smith  A widow Mrs Smith\\nand who was her husband  One of five thousand Mr Smiths whose names\\nare to be met with everywhere  And what is her attraction\\nThat she is old and sickly  Upon my word Miss Anne Elliot\\nyou have the most extraordinary taste  Everything that revolts\\nother people low company paltry rooms foul air disgusting associations\\nare inviting to you  But surely you may put off this old lady\\ntill tomorrow  she is not so near her end I presume\\nbut that she may hope to see another day  What is her age  Forty\\n\\nNo sir she is not oneandthirty but I do not think I can\\nput off my engagement because it is the only evening for some time\\nwhich will at once suit her and myself  She goes into the warm bath\\ntomorrow and for the rest of the week you know we are engaged\\n\\nBut what does Lady Russell think of this acquaintance asked Elizabeth\\n\\nShe sees nothing to blame in it replied Anne on the contrary\\nshe approves it and has generally taken me when I have\\ncalled on Mrs Smith\\n\\nWestgate Buildings must have been rather surprised by the appearance\\nof a carriage drawn up near its pavement observed Sir Walter\\nSir Henry Russells widow indeed has no honours to distinguish her arms\\nbut still it is a handsome equipage and no doubt is well known\\nto convey a Miss Elliot  A widow Mrs Smith lodging in Westgate Buildings\\nA poor widow barely able to live between thirty and forty\\na mere Mrs Smith an everyday Mrs Smith of all people and all names\\nin the world to be the chosen friend of Miss Anne Elliot\\nand to be preferred by her to her own family connections among the nobility\\nof England and Ireland  Mrs Smith  Such a name\\n\\nMrs Clay who had been present while all this passed now thought it\\nadvisable to leave the room and Anne could have said much\\nand did long to say a little in defence of her friends\\nnot very dissimilar claims to theirs but her sense of personal respect\\nto her father prevented her  She made no reply  She left it\\nto himself to recollect that Mrs Smith was not the only widow\\nin Bath between thirty and forty with little to live on\\nand no surname of dignity\\n\\nAnne kept her appointment the others kept theirs and of course\\nshe heard the next morning that they had had a delightful evening\\nShe had been the only one of the set absent for Sir Walter\\nand Elizabeth had not only been quite at her ladyships service themselves\\nbut had actually been happy to be employed by her in collecting others\\nand had been at the trouble of inviting both Lady Russell and Mr Elliot\\nand Mr Elliot had made a point of leaving Colonel Wallis early\\nand Lady Russell had fresh arranged all her evening engagements\\nin order to wait on her  Anne had the whole history of all that\\nsuch an evening could supply from Lady Russell  To her\\nits greatest interest must be in having been very much talked of\\nbetween her friend and Mr Elliot in having been wished for regretted\\nand at the same time honoured for staying away in such a cause\\nHer kind compassionate visits to this old schoolfellow\\nsick and reduced seemed to have quite delighted Mr Elliot\\nHe thought her a most extraordinary young woman in her temper manners\\nmind a model of female excellence  He could meet even Lady Russell\\nin a discussion of her merits and Anne could not be given to understand\\nso much by her friend could not know herself to be so highly rated\\nby a sensible man without many of those agreeable sensations\\nwhich her friend meant to create\\n\\nLady Russell was now perfectly decided in her opinion of Mr Elliot\\nShe was as much convinced of his meaning to gain Anne in time as of\\nhis deserving her and was beginning to calculate the number of weeks\\nwhich would free him from all the remaining restraints of widowhood\\nand leave him at liberty to exert his most open powers of pleasing\\nShe would not speak to Anne with half the certainty she felt on the subject\\nshe would venture on little more than hints of what might be hereafter\\nof a possible attachment on his side of the desirableness of the alliance\\nsupposing such attachment to be real and returned  Anne heard her\\nand made no violent exclamations she only smiled blushed\\nand gently shook her head\\n\\nI am no matchmaker as you well know said Lady Russell\\nbeing much too well aware of the uncertainty of all human events\\nand calculations  I only mean that if Mr Elliot should some time hence\\npay his addresses to you and if you should be disposed to accept him\\nI think there would be every possibility of your being happy together\\nA most suitable connection everybody must consider it but I think\\nit might be a very happy one\\n\\nMr Elliot is an exceedingly agreeable man and in many respects\\nI think highly of him said Anne but we should not suit\\n\\nLady Russell let this pass and only said in rejoinder I own that\\nto be able to regard you as the future mistress of Kellynch\\nthe future Lady Elliot to look forward and see you occupying\\nyour dear mothers place succeeding to all her rights\\nand all her popularity as well as to all her virtues would be\\nthe highest possible gratification to me  You are your mothers self\\nin countenance and disposition and if I might be allowed to fancy you\\nsuch as she was in situation and name and home presiding and blessing\\nin the same spot and only superior to her in being more highly valued\\nMy dearest Anne it would give me more delight than is often felt\\nat my time of life\\n\\nAnne was obliged to turn away to rise to walk to a distant table\\nand leaning there in pretended employment try to subdue the feelings\\nthis picture excited  For a few moments her imagination and her heart\\nwere bewitched  The idea of becoming what her mother had been\\nof having the precious name of Lady Elliot first revived in herself\\nof being restored to Kellynch calling it her home again\\nher home for ever was a charm which she could not immediately resist\\nLady Russell said not another word willing to leave the matter\\nto its own operation and believing that could Mr Elliot at that moment\\nwith propriety have spoken for himselfshe believed in short\\nwhat Anne did not believe  The same image of Mr Elliot speaking\\nfor himself brought Anne to composure again  The charm of Kellynch\\nand of Lady Elliot all faded away  She never could accept him\\nAnd it was not only that her feelings were still adverse to any man\\nsave one her judgement on a serious consideration of the possibilities\\nof such a case was against Mr Elliot\\n\\nThough they had now been acquainted a month she could not be satisfied\\nthat she really knew his character  That he was a sensible man\\nan agreeable man that he talked well professed good opinions\\nseemed to judge properly and as a man of principle this was all\\nclear enough  He certainly knew what was right nor could she fix\\non any one article of moral duty evidently transgressed but yet she would\\nhave been afraid to answer for his conduct  She distrusted the past\\nif not the present  The names which occasionally dropt\\nof former associates the allusions to former practices and pursuits\\nsuggested suspicions not favourable of what he had been\\nShe saw that there had been bad habits that Sunday travelling\\nhad been a common thing that there had been a period of his life\\nand probably not a short one when he had been at least\\ncareless in all serious matters and though he might now think\\nvery differently who could answer for the true sentiments of a clever\\ncautious man grown old enough to appreciate a fair character\\nHow could it ever be ascertained that his mind was truly cleansed\\n\\nMr Elliot was rational discreet polished but he was not open\\nThere was never any burst of feeling any warmth of indignation or delight\\nat the evil or good of others  This to Anne was a decided imperfection\\nHer early impressions were incurable  She prized the frank\\nthe openhearted the eager character beyond all others\\nWarmth and enthusiasm did captivate her still  She felt that she could\\nso much more depend upon the sincerity of those who sometimes looked\\nor said a careless or a hasty thing than of those whose presence of mind\\nnever varied whose tongue never slipped\\n\\nMr Elliot was too generally agreeable  Various as were the tempers\\nin her fathers house he pleased them all  He endured too well\\nstood too well with every body  He had spoken to her with some\\ndegree of openness of Mrs Clay had appeared completely to see\\nwhat Mrs Clay was about and to hold her in contempt and yet\\nMrs Clay found him as agreeable as any body\\n\\nLady Russell saw either less or more than her young friend\\nfor she saw nothing to excite distrust  She could not imagine\\na man more exactly what he ought to be than Mr Elliot nor did she\\never enjoy a sweeter feeling than the hope of seeing him receive\\nthe hand of her beloved Anne in Kellynch church in the course of\\nthe following autumn\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 18\\n\\n\\nIt was the beginning of February and Anne having been a month in Bath\\nwas growing very eager for news from Uppercross and Lyme\\nShe wanted to hear much more than Mary had communicated\\nIt was three weeks since she had heard at all  She only knew\\nthat Henrietta was at home again and that Louisa though considered to be\\nrecovering fast was still in Lyme and she was thinking of them all\\nvery intently one evening when a thicker letter than usual from Mary\\nwas delivered to her and to quicken the pleasure and surprise\\nwith Admiral and Mrs Crofts compliments\\n\\nThe Crofts must be in Bath  A circumstance to interest her\\nThey were people whom her heart turned to very naturally\\n\\nWhat is this cried Sir Walter  The Crofts have arrived in Bath\\nThe Crofts who rent Kellynch  What have they brought you\\n\\nA letter from Uppercross Cottage Sir\\n\\nOh those letters are convenient passports  They secure an introduction\\nI should have visited Admiral Croft however at any rate\\nI know what is due to my tenant\\n\\nAnne could listen no longer she could not even have told how\\nthe poor Admirals complexion escaped her letter engrossed her\\nIt had been begun several days back\\n\\n\\n            February 1st\\n\\nMy dear AnneI make no apology for my silence because I know\\nhow little people think of letters in such a place as Bath\\nYou must be a great deal too happy to care for Uppercross which\\nas you well know affords little to write about  We have had\\na very dull Christmas Mr and Mrs Musgrove have not had one dinner party\\nall the holidays  I do not reckon the Hayters as anybody\\nThe holidays however are over at last  I believe no children ever had\\nsuch long ones  I am sure I had not  The house was cleared yesterday\\nexcept of the little Harvilles but you will be surprised to hear\\nthey have never gone home  Mrs Harville must be an odd mother\\nto part with them so long  I do not understand it  They are\\nnot at all nice children in my opinion but Mrs Musgrove seems to\\nlike them quite as well if not better than her grandchildren\\nWhat dreadful weather we have had  It may not be felt in Bath\\nwith your nice pavements but in the country it is of some consequence\\nI have not had a creature call on me since the second week in January\\nexcept Charles Hayter who had been calling much oftener than was welcome\\nBetween ourselves I think it a great pity Henrietta did not remain at Lyme\\nas long as Louisa it would have kept her a little out of his way\\nThe carriage is gone today to bring Louisa and the Harvilles tomorrow\\nWe are not asked to dine with them however till the day after\\nMrs Musgrove is so afraid of her being fatigued by the journey\\nwhich is not very likely considering the care that will be taken of her\\nand it would be much more convenient to me to dine there tomorrow\\nI am glad you find Mr Elliot so agreeable and wish I could be acquainted\\nwith him too but I have my usual luck  I am always out of the way\\nwhen any thing desirable is going on always the last of my family\\nto be noticed  What an immense time Mrs Clay has been staying\\nwith Elizabeth  Does she never mean to go away  But perhaps\\nif she were to leave the room vacant we might not be invited\\nLet me know what you think of this  I do not expect my children\\nto be asked you know  I can leave them at the Great House very well\\nfor a month or six weeks  I have this moment heard that the Crofts\\nare going to Bath almost immediately they think the Admiral gouty\\nCharles heard it quite by chance they have not had the civility\\nto give me any notice or of offering to take anything\\nI do not think they improve at all as neighbours  We see nothing of them\\nand this is really an instance of gross inattention  Charles joins me\\nin love and everything proper  Yours affectionately\\n\\n  Mary M\\n\\nI am sorry to say that I am very far from well and Jemima has\\njust told me that the butcher says there is a bad sorethroat\\nvery much about  I dare say I shall catch it and my sorethroats\\nyou know are always worse than anybodys\\n\\n\\nSo ended the first part which had been afterwards put into an envelope\\ncontaining nearly as much more\\n\\n\\nI kept my letter open that I might send you word how Louisa\\nbore her journey and now I am extremely glad I did having a great deal\\nto add  In the first place I had a note from Mrs Croft yesterday\\noffering to convey anything to you a very kind friendly note indeed\\naddressed to me just as it ought I shall therefore be able to\\nmake my letter as long as I like  The Admiral does not seem very ill\\nand I sincerely hope Bath will do him all the good he wants\\nI shall be truly glad to have them back again  Our neighbourhood\\ncannot spare such a pleasant family  But now for Louisa\\nI have something to communicate that will astonish you not a little\\nShe and the Harvilles came on Tuesday very safely and in the evening\\nwe went to ask her how she did when we were rather surprised\\nnot to find Captain Benwick of the party for he had been invited\\nas well as the Harvilles and what do you think was the reason\\nNeither more nor less than his being in love with Louisa\\nand not choosing to venture to Uppercross till he had had an answer\\nfrom Mr Musgrove for it was all settled between him and her\\nbefore she came away and he had written to her father by Captain Harville\\nTrue upon my honour  Are not you astonished  I shall be surprised\\nat least if you ever received a hint of it for I never did\\nMrs Musgrove protests solemnly that she knew nothing of the matter\\nWe are all very well pleased however for though it is not equal to her\\nmarrying Captain Wentworth it is infinitely better than Charles Hayter\\nand Mr Musgrove has written his consent and Captain Benwick\\nis expected today  Mrs Harville says her husband feels a good deal\\non his poor sisters account but however Louisa is a great favourite\\nwith both  Indeed Mrs Harville and I quite agree that we love her\\nthe better for having nursed her  Charles wonders what Captain Wentworth\\nwill say but if you remember I never thought him attached to Louisa\\nI never could see anything of it  And this is the end you see\\nof Captain Benwicks being supposed to be an admirer of yours\\nHow Charles could take such a thing into his head was always\\nincomprehensible to me  I hope he will be more agreeable now\\nCertainly not a great match for Louisa Musgrove but a million times better\\nthan marrying among the Hayters\\n\\n\\nMary need not have feared her sisters being in any degree prepared\\nfor the news  She had never in her life been more astonished\\nCaptain Benwick and Louisa Musgrove  It was almost too wonderful\\nfor belief and it was with the greatest effort that she could remain\\nin the room preserve an air of calmness and answer the common questions\\nof the moment  Happily for her they were not many  Sir Walter\\nwanted to know whether the Crofts travelled with four horses\\nand whether they were likely to be situated in such a part of Bath\\nas it might suit Miss Elliot and himself to visit in but had\\nlittle curiosity beyond\\n\\nHow is Mary said Elizabeth and without waiting for an answer\\nAnd pray what brings the Crofts to Bath\\n\\nThey come on the Admirals account  He is thought to be gouty\\n\\nGout and decrepitude said Sir Walter  Poor old gentleman\\n\\nHave they any acquaintance here asked Elizabeth\\n\\nI do not know but I can hardly suppose that at Admiral Crofts\\ntime of life and in his profession he should not have many acquaintance\\nin such a place as this\\n\\nI suspect said Sir Walter coolly that Admiral Croft\\nwill be best known in Bath as the renter of Kellynch Hall\\nElizabeth may we venture to present him and his wife in Laura Place\\n\\nOh no I think not  Situated as we are with Lady Dalrymple cousins\\nwe ought to be very careful not to embarrass her with acquaintance\\nshe might not approve  If we were not related it would not signify\\nbut as cousins she would feel scrupulous as to any proposal of ours\\nWe had better leave the Crofts to find their own level\\nThere are several oddlooking men walking about here who\\nI am told are sailors  The Crofts will associate with them\\n\\nThis was Sir Walter and Elizabeths share of interest in the letter\\nwhen Mrs Clay had paid her tribute of more decent attention\\nin an enquiry after Mrs Charles Musgrove and her fine little boys\\nAnne was at liberty\\n\\nIn her own room she tried to comprehend it  Well might Charles wonder\\nhow Captain Wentworth would feel  Perhaps he had quitted the field\\nhad given Louisa up had ceased to love had found he did not love her\\nShe could not endure the idea of treachery or levity or anything\\nakin to ill usage between him and his friend  She could not endure\\nthat such a friendship as theirs should be severed unfairly\\n\\nCaptain Benwick and Louisa Musgrove  The highspirited\\njoyoustalking Louisa Musgrove and the dejected thinking\\nfeeling reading Captain Benwick seemed each of them everything\\nthat would not suit the other  Their minds most dissimilar\\nWhere could have been the attraction  The answer soon presented itself\\nIt had been in situation  They had been thrown together several weeks\\nthey had been living in the same small family party  since Henriettas\\ncoming away they must have been depending almost entirely on each other\\nand Louisa just recovering from illness had been in an interesting state\\nand Captain Benwick was not inconsolable  That was a point which Anne\\nhad not been able to avoid suspecting before and instead of drawing\\nthe same conclusion as Mary from the present course of events\\nthey served only to confirm the idea of his having felt some\\ndawning of tenderness toward herself  She did not mean however\\nto derive much more from it to gratify her vanity than Mary\\nmight have allowed  She was persuaded that any tolerably pleasing\\nyoung woman who had listened and seemed to feel for him would have\\nreceived the same compliment  He had an affectionate heart\\nHe must love somebody\\n\\nShe saw no reason against their being happy  Louisa had fine\\nnaval fervour to begin with and they would soon grow more alike\\nHe would gain cheerfulness and she would learn to be an enthusiast\\nfor Scott and Lord Byron nay that was probably learnt already\\nof course they had fallen in love over poetry  The idea of\\nLouisa Musgrove turned into a person of literary taste\\nand sentimental reflection was amusing but she had no doubt\\nof its being so  The day at Lyme the fall from the Cobb\\nmight influence her health her nerves her courage her character to\\nthe end of her life as thoroughly as it appeared to have\\ninfluenced her fate\\n\\nThe conclusion of the whole was that if the woman who had been sensible\\nof Captain Wentworths merits could be allowed to prefer another man\\nthere was nothing in the engagement to excite lasting wonder\\nand if Captain Wentworth lost no friend by it certainly nothing\\nto be regretted  No it was not regret which made Annes heart\\nbeat in spite of herself and brought the colour into her cheeks\\nwhen she thought of Captain Wentworth unshackled and free\\nShe had some feelings which she was ashamed to investigate\\nThey were too much like joy senseless joy\\n\\nShe longed to see the Crofts but when the meeting took place\\nit was evident that no rumour of the news had yet reached them\\nThe visit of ceremony was paid and returned and Louisa Musgrove\\nwas mentioned and Captain Benwick too without even half a smile\\n\\nThe Crofts had placed themselves in lodgings in Gay Street\\nperfectly to Sir Walters satisfaction  He was not at all ashamed\\nof the acquaintance and did in fact think and talk a great deal more\\nabout the Admiral than the Admiral ever thought or talked about him\\n\\nThe Crofts knew quite as many people in Bath as they wished for\\nand considered their intercourse with the Elliots as a mere matter of form\\nand not in the least likely to afford them any pleasure\\nThey brought with them their country habit of being almost always together\\nHe was ordered to walk to keep off the gout and Mrs Croft\\nseemed to go shares with him in everything and to walk\\nfor her life to do him good  Anne saw them wherever she went\\nLady Russell took her out in her carriage almost every morning\\nand she never failed to think of them and never failed to see them\\nKnowing their feelings as she did it was a most attractive picture\\nof happiness to her  She always watched them as long as she could\\ndelighted to fancy she understood what they might be talking of\\nas they walked along in happy independence or equally delighted\\nto see the Admirals hearty shake of the hand when he encountered\\nan old friend and observe their eagerness of conversation\\nwhen occasionally forming into a little knot of the navy Mrs Croft\\nlooking as intelligent and keen as any of the officers around her\\n\\nAnne was too much engaged with Lady Russell to be often walking herself\\nbut it so happened that one morning about a week or ten days\\nafter the Crofts arrival it suited her best to leave her friend\\nor her friends carriage in the lower part of the town\\nand return alone to Camden Place and in walking up Milsom Street\\nshe had the good fortune to meet with the Admiral  He was standing\\nby himself at a printshop window with his hands behind him\\nin earnest contemplation of some print and she not only might have\\npassed him unseen but was obliged to touch as well as address him\\nbefore she could catch his notice  When he did perceive and\\nacknowledge her however it was done with all his usual frankness\\nand good humour  Ha is it you  Thank you thank you\\nThis is treating me like a friend  Here I am you see\\nstaring at a picture  I can never get by this shop without stopping\\nBut what a thing here is by way of a boat  Do look at it\\nDid you ever see the like  What queer fellows your fine painters must be\\nto think that anybody would venture their lives in such a shapeless\\nold cockleshell as that  And yet here are two gentlemen\\nstuck up in it mightily at their ease and looking about them at the rocks\\nand mountains as if they were not to be upset the next moment\\nwhich they certainly must be  I wonder where that boat was built\\nlaughing heartily I would not venture over a horsepond in it\\nWell turning away now where are you bound  Can I go anywhere\\nfor you or with you  Can I be of any use\\n\\nNone I thank you unless you will give me the pleasure of your company\\nthe little way our road lies together  I am going home\\n\\n\\nThat I will with all my heart and farther too  Yes yes\\nwe will have a snug walk together and I have something to tell you\\nas we go along  There take my arm thats right I do not\\nfeel comfortable if I have not a woman there  Lord what a boat it is\\ntaking a last look at the picture as they began to be in motion\\n\\nDid you say that you had something to tell me sir\\n\\nYes I have presently  But here comes a friend Captain Brigden\\nI shall only say How dye do as we pass however  I shall not stop\\nHow dye do  Brigden stares to see anybody with me but my wife\\nShe poor soul is tied by the leg  She has a blister on one of her heels\\nas large as a threeshilling piece  If you look across the street\\nyou will see Admiral Brand coming down and his brother  Shabby fellows\\nboth of them  I am glad they are not on this side of the way\\nSophy cannot bear them  They played me a pitiful trick once\\ngot away with some of my best men  I will tell you the whole story\\nanother time  There comes old Sir Archibald Drew and his grandson\\nLook he sees us he kisses his hand to you he takes you for my wife\\nAh the peace has come too soon for that younker  Poor old Sir Archibald\\nHow do you like Bath Miss Elliot  It suits us very well\\nWe are always meeting with some old friend or other the streets\\nfull of them every morning sure to have plenty of chat\\nand then we get away from them all and shut ourselves in our lodgings\\nand draw in our chairs and are snug as if we were at Kellynch\\nay or as we used to be even at North Yarmouth and Deal\\nWe do not like our lodgings here the worse I can tell you\\nfor putting us in mind of those we first had at North Yarmouth\\nThe wind blows through one of the cupboards just in the same way\\n\\nWhen they were got a little farther Anne ventured to press again\\nfor what he had to communicate  She hoped when clear of Milsom Street\\nto have her curiosity gratified but she was still obliged to wait\\nfor the Admiral had made up his mind not to begin till they had\\ngained the greater space and quiet of Belmont and as she was\\nnot really Mrs Croft she must let him have his own way\\nAs soon as they were fairly ascending Belmont he began\\n\\nWell now you shall hear something that will surprise you\\nBut first of all you must tell me the name of the young lady\\nI am going to talk about  That young lady you know that we have\\nall been so concerned for  The Miss Musgrove that all this has been\\nhappening to  Her Christian name  I always forget her Christian name\\n\\nAnne had been ashamed to appear to comprehend so soon as she really\\ndid but now she could safely suggest the name of Louisa\\n\\nAy ay Miss Louisa Musgrove that is the name  I wish young ladies\\nhad not such a number of fine Christian names  I should never be out\\nif they were all Sophys or something of that sort  Well\\nthis Miss Louisa we all thought you know was to marry Frederick\\nHe was courting her week after week  The only wonder was\\nwhat they could be waiting for till the business at Lyme came\\nthen indeed it was clear enough that they must wait till her brain\\nwas set to right  But even then there was something odd in their\\nway of going on  Instead of staying at Lyme he went off to Plymouth\\nand then he went off to see Edward  When we came back from Minehead\\nhe was gone down to Edwards and there he has been ever since\\nWe have seen nothing of him since November  Even Sophy could\\nnot understand it  But now the matter has take the strangest turn of all\\nfor this young lady the same Miss Musgrove instead of being\\nto marry Frederick is to marry James Benwick  You know James Benwick\\n\\nA little  I am a little acquainted with Captain Benwick\\n\\nWell she is to marry him  Nay most likely they are married already\\nfor I do not know what they should wait for\\n\\nI thought Captain Benwick a very pleasing young man said Anne\\nand I understand that he bears an excellent character\\n\\nOh yes yes there is not a word to be said against James Benwick\\nHe is only a commander it is true made last summer and these are\\nbad times for getting on but he has not another fault that I know of\\nAn excellent goodhearted fellow I assure you a very active\\nzealous officer too which is more than you would think for perhaps\\nfor that soft sort of manner does not do him justice\\n\\nIndeed you are mistaken there sir I should never augur want of spirit\\nfrom Captain Benwicks manners  I thought them particularly pleasing\\nand I will answer for it they would generally please\\n\\nWell well ladies are the best judges but James Benwick is rather too\\npiano for me and though very likely it is all our partiality\\nSophy and I cannot help thinking Fredericks manners better than his\\nThere is something about Frederick more to our taste\\n\\nAnne was caught  She had only meant to oppose the too common idea\\nof spirit and gentleness being incompatible with each other\\nnot at all to represent Captain Benwicks manners as the very best\\nthat could possibly be and after a little hesitation\\nshe was beginning to say I was not entering into any comparison\\nof the two friends but the Admiral interrupted her with\\n\\nAnd the thing is certainly true  It is not a mere bit of gossip\\nWe have it from Frederick himself  His sister had a letter\\nfrom him yesterday in which he tells us of it and he had just had it\\nin a letter from Harville written upon the spot from Uppercross\\nI fancy they are all at Uppercross\\n\\nThis was an opportunity which Anne could not resist she said therefore\\nI hope Admiral I hope there is nothing in the style of Captain\\nWentworths letter to make you and Mrs Croft particularly uneasy\\nIt did seem last autumn as if there were an attachment between him\\nand Louisa Musgrove but I hope it may be understood to have worn out\\non each side equally and without violence  I hope his letter\\ndoes not breathe the spirit of an illused man\\n\\nNot at all not at all there is not an oath or a murmur\\nfrom beginning to end\\n\\nAnne looked down to hide her smile\\n\\nNo no Frederick is not a man to whine and complain he has\\ntoo much spirit for that  If the girl likes another man better\\nit is very fit she should have him\\n\\nCertainly  But what I mean is that I hope there is nothing\\nin Captain Wentworths manner of writing to make you suppose\\nhe thinks himself illused by his friend which might appear\\nyou know without its being absolutely said  I should be very sorry\\nthat such a friendship as has subsisted between him and Captain Benwick\\nshould be destroyed or even wounded by a circumstance of this sort\\n\\nYes yes I understand you  But there is nothing at all of that nature\\nin the letter  He does not give the least fling at Benwick\\ndoes not so much as say I wonder at it I have a reason of my own\\nfor wondering at it  No you would not guess from his way of writing\\nthat he had ever thought of this Miss whats her name for himself\\nHe very handsomely hopes they will be happy together and there is\\nnothing very unforgiving in that I think\\n\\nAnne did not receive the perfect conviction which the Admiral meant\\nto convey but it would have been useless to press the enquiry farther\\nShe therefore satisfied herself with commonplace remarks or quiet\\nattention and the Admiral had it all his own way\\n\\nPoor Frederick said he at last  Now he must begin all over again\\nwith somebody else  I think we must get him to Bath  Sophy must write\\nand beg him to come to Bath  Here are pretty girls enough I am sure\\nIt would be of no use to go to Uppercross again for that other\\nMiss Musgrove I find is bespoke by her cousin the young parson\\nDo not you think Miss Elliot we had better try to get him to Bath\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 19\\n\\n\\nWhile Admiral Croft was taking this walk with Anne and expressing\\nhis wish of getting Captain Wentworth to Bath Captain Wentworth\\nwas already on his way thither  Before Mrs Croft had written\\nhe was arrived and the very next time Anne walked out she saw him\\n\\nMr Elliot was attending his two cousins and Mrs Clay  They were\\nin Milsom Street  It began to rain not much but enough to\\nmake shelter desirable for women and quite enough to make it\\nvery desirable for Miss Elliot to have the advantage of being\\nconveyed home in Lady Dalrymples carriage which was seen waiting\\nat a little distance she Anne and Mrs Clay therefore\\nturned into Mollands while Mr Elliot stepped to Lady Dalrymple\\nto request her assistance  He soon joined them again successful\\nof course Lady Dalrymple would be most happy to take them home\\nand would call for them in a few minutes\\n\\nHer ladyships carriage was a barouche and did not hold\\nmore than four with any comfort  Miss Carteret was with her mother\\nconsequently it was not reasonable to expect accommodation\\nfor all the three Camden Place ladies  There could be no doubt\\nas to Miss Elliot  Whoever suffered inconvenience she must suffer none\\nbut it occupied a little time to settle the point of civility\\nbetween the other two  The rain was a mere trifle and Anne was\\nmost sincere in preferring a walk with Mr Elliot  But the rain was also\\na mere trifle to Mrs Clay she would hardly allow it even to drop at all\\nand her boots were so thick much thicker than Miss Annes\\nand in short her civility rendered her quite as anxious to be left\\nto walk with Mr Elliot as Anne could be and it was discussed between them\\nwith a generosity so polite and so determined that the others were\\nobliged to settle it for them Miss Elliot maintaining that Mrs Clay\\nhad a little cold already and Mr Elliot deciding on appeal\\nthat his cousin Annes boots were rather the thickest\\n\\nIt was fixed accordingly that Mrs Clay should be of the party\\nin the carriage and they had just reached this point when Anne\\nas she sat near the window descried most decidedly and distinctly\\nCaptain Wentworth walking down the street\\n\\nHer start was perceptible only to herself but she instantly felt that\\nshe was the greatest simpleton in the world the most unaccountable\\nand absurd  For a few minutes she saw nothing before her\\nit was all confusion  She was lost and when she had scolded\\nback her senses she found the others still waiting for the carriage\\nand Mr Elliot always obliging just setting off for Union Street\\non a commission of Mrs Clays\\n\\nShe now felt a great inclination to go to the outer door\\nshe wanted to see if it rained  Why was she to suspect herself\\nof another motive  Captain Wentworth must be out of sight\\nShe left her seat she would go one half of her should not be always\\nso much wiser than the other half or always suspecting the other\\nof being worse than it was  She would see if it rained\\nShe was sent back however in a moment by the entrance of\\nCaptain Wentworth himself among a party of gentlemen and ladies\\nevidently his acquaintance and whom he must have joined\\na little below Milsom Street  He was more obviously struck\\nand confused by the sight of her than she had ever observed before\\nhe looked quite red  For the first time since their renewed acquaintance\\nshe felt that she was betraying the least sensibility of the two\\nShe had the advantage of him in the preparation of the last few moments\\nAll the overpowering blinding bewildering first effects\\nof strong surprise were over with her  Still however\\nshe had enough to feel  It was agitation pain pleasure\\na something between delight and misery\\n\\nHe spoke to her and then turned away  The character of his manner\\nwas embarrassment  She could not have called it either cold or friendly\\nor anything so certainly as embarrassed\\n\\nAfter a short interval however he came towards her and spoke again\\nMutual enquiries on common subjects passed  neither of them probably\\nmuch the wiser for what they heard and Anne continuing fully sensible\\nof his being less at ease than formerly  They had by dint of being\\nso very much together got to speak to each other with a considerable\\nportion of apparent indifference and calmness but he could not do it now\\nTime had changed him or Louisa had changed him  There was consciousness\\nof some sort or other  He looked very well not as if he had been\\nsuffering in health or spirits and he talked of Uppercross\\nof the Musgroves nay even of Louisa and had even a momentary look\\nof his own arch significance as he named her but yet it was\\nCaptain Wentworth not comfortable not easy not able to feign that he was\\n\\nIt did not surprise but it grieved Anne to observe that Elizabeth\\nwould not know him  She saw that he saw Elizabeth that Elizabeth saw him\\nthat there was complete internal recognition on each side\\nshe was convinced that he was ready to be acknowledged as an acquaintance\\nexpecting it and she had the pain of seeing her sister turn away\\nwith unalterable coldness\\n\\nLady Dalrymples carriage for which Miss Elliot was growing\\nvery impatient now drew up the servant came in to announce it\\nIt was beginning to rain again and altogether there was a delay\\nand a bustle and a talking which must make all the little crowd\\nin the shop understand that Lady Dalrymple was calling to convey\\nMiss Elliot  At last Miss Elliot and her friend unattended but\\nby the servant for there was no cousin returned were walking off\\nand Captain Wentworth watching them turned again to Anne\\nand by manner rather than words was offering his services to her\\n\\nI am much obliged to you was her answer but I am not going with them\\nThe carriage would not accommodate so many  I walk  I prefer walking\\n\\nBut it rains\\n\\nOh very little  Nothing that I regard\\n\\nAfter a moments pause he said  Though I came only yesterday\\nI have equipped myself properly for Bath already you see\\npointing to a new umbrella I wish you would make use of it\\nif you are determined to walk though I think it would be more prudent\\nto let me get you a chair\\n\\nShe was very much obliged to him but declined it all repeating\\nher conviction that the rain would come to nothing at present\\nand adding I am only waiting for Mr Elliot  He will be here in a moment\\nI am sure\\n\\nShe had hardly spoken the words when Mr Elliot walked in\\nCaptain Wentworth recollected him perfectly  There was no difference\\nbetween him and the man who had stood on the steps at Lyme\\nadmiring Anne as she passed except in the air and look and manner\\nof the privileged relation and friend  He came in with eagerness\\nappeared to see and think only of her apologised for his stay\\nwas grieved to have kept her waiting and anxious to get her away\\nwithout further loss of time and before the rain increased\\nand in another moment they walked off together her arm under his\\na gentle and embarrassed glance and a Good morning to you\\nbeing all that she had time for as she passed away\\n\\nAs soon as they were out of sight the ladies of Captain Wentworths party\\nbegan talking of them\\n\\nMr Elliot does not dislike his cousin I fancy\\n\\nOh no that is clear enough  One can guess what will happen there\\nHe is always with them half lives in the family I believe\\nWhat a very goodlooking man\\n\\nYes and Miss Atkinson who dined with him once at the Wallises\\nsays he is the most agreeable man she ever was in company with\\n\\nShe is pretty I think Anne Elliot very pretty when one comes\\nto look at her  It is not the fashion to say so but I confess\\nI admire her more than her sister\\n\\nOh so do I\\n\\nAnd so do I  No comparison  But the men are all wild after Miss Elliot\\nAnne is too delicate for them\\n\\nAnne would have been particularly obliged to her cousin if he would have\\nwalked by her side all the way to Camden Place without saying a word\\nShe had never found it so difficult to listen to him though nothing\\ncould exceed his solicitude and care and though his subjects\\nwere principally such as were wont to be always interesting\\npraise warm just and discriminating of Lady Russell\\nand insinuations highly rational against Mrs Clay  But just now\\nshe could think only of Captain Wentworth  She could not understand\\nhis present feelings whether he were really suffering much\\nfrom disappointment or not and till that point were settled\\nshe could not be quite herself\\n\\nShe hoped to be wise and reasonable in time but alas alas\\nshe must confess to herself that she was not wise yet\\n\\nAnother circumstance very essential for her to know was how long\\nhe meant to be in Bath he had not mentioned it or she could not\\nrecollect it  He might be only passing through  But it was more probable\\nthat he should be come to stay  In that case so liable as every body was\\nto meet every body in Bath Lady Russell would in all likelihood\\nsee him somewhere  Would she recollect him  How would it all be\\n\\nShe had already been obliged to tell Lady Russell that Louisa Musgrove\\nwas to marry Captain Benwick  It had cost her something to encounter\\nLady Russells surprise and now if she were by any chance\\nto be thrown into company with Captain Wentworth her imperfect knowledge\\nof the matter might add another shade of prejudice against him\\n\\nThe following morning Anne was out with her friend and for the first hour\\nin an incessant and fearful sort of watch for him in vain but at last\\nin returning down Pulteney Street she distinguished him\\non the right hand pavement at such a distance as to have him in view\\nthe greater part of the street  There were many other men about him\\nmany groups walking the same way but there was no mistaking him\\nShe looked instinctively at Lady Russell but not from any mad idea\\nof her recognising him so soon as she did herself  No it was\\nnot to be supposed that Lady Russell would perceive him till they\\nwere nearly opposite  She looked at her however from time to time\\nanxiously and when the moment approached which must point him out\\nthough not daring to look again for her own countenance she knew\\nwas unfit to be seen she was yet perfectly conscious of\\nLady Russells eyes being turned exactly in the direction for him\\nof her being in short intently observing him  She could thoroughly\\ncomprehend the sort of fascination he must possess over Lady Russells mind\\nthe difficulty it must be for her to withdraw her eyes the astonishment\\nshe must be feeling that eight or nine years should have passed over him\\nand in foreign climes and in active service too without robbing him\\nof one personal grace\\n\\nAt last Lady Russell drew back her head  Now how would she\\nspeak of him\\n\\nYou will wonder said she what has been fixing my eye so long\\nbut I was looking after some windowcurtains which Lady Alicia and\\nMrs Frankland were telling me of last night  They described\\nthe drawingroom windowcurtains of one of the houses on this\\nside of the way and this part of the street as being the handsomest\\nand best hung of any in Bath but could not recollect the exact number\\nand I have been trying to find out which it could be but I confess\\nI can see no curtains hereabouts that answer their description\\n\\nAnne sighed and blushed and smiled in pity and disdain\\neither at her friend or herself  The part which provoked her most\\nwas that in all this waste of foresight and caution she should have\\nlost the right moment for seeing whether he saw them\\n\\nA day or two passed without producing anything  The theatre or the rooms\\nwhere he was most likely to be were not fashionable enough\\nfor the Elliots whose evening amusements were solely in the\\nelegant stupidity of private parties in which they were getting\\nmore and more engaged and Anne wearied of such a state of stagnation\\nsick of knowing nothing and fancying herself stronger because\\nher strength was not tried was quite impatient for the concert evening\\nIt was a concert for the benefit of a person patronised by Lady Dalrymple\\nOf course they must attend  It was really expected to be a good one\\nand Captain Wentworth was very fond of music  If she could only have\\na few minutes conversation with him again she fancied she should\\nbe satisfied and as to the power of addressing him she felt all over\\ncourage if the opportunity occurred  Elizabeth had turned from him\\nLady Russell overlooked him her nerves were strengthened\\nby these circumstances she felt that she owed him attention\\n\\nShe had once partly promised Mrs Smith to spend the evening with her\\nbut in a short hurried call she excused herself and put it off\\nwith the more decided promise of a longer visit on the morrow\\nMrs Smith gave a most goodhumoured acquiescence\\n\\nBy all means said she only tell me all about it when you do come\\nWho is your party\\n\\nAnne named them all  Mrs Smith made no reply but when she was\\nleaving her said and with an expression half serious half arch\\nWell I heartily wish your concert may answer and do not fail me\\ntomorrow if you can come for I begin to have a foreboding\\nthat I may not have many more visits from you\\n\\nAnne was startled and confused but after standing in a moments suspense\\nwas obliged and not sorry to be obliged to hurry away\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 20\\n\\n\\nSir Walter his two daughters and Mrs Clay were the earliest\\nof all their party at the rooms in the evening and as Lady Dalrymple\\nmust be waited for they took their station by one of the fires\\nin the Octagon Room  But hardly were they so settled when the door\\nopened again and Captain Wentworth walked in alone  Anne was\\nthe nearest to him and making yet a little advance she instantly spoke\\nHe was preparing only to bow and pass on but her gentle How do you do\\nbrought him out of the straight line to stand near her and make enquiries\\nin return in spite of the formidable father and sister in the back ground\\nTheir being in the back ground was a support to Anne she knew nothing\\nof their looks and felt equal to everything which she believed\\nright to be done\\n\\nWhile they were speaking a whispering between her father and Elizabeth\\ncaught her ear  She could not distinguish but she must guess the subject\\nand on Captain Wentworths making a distant bow she comprehended\\nthat her father had judged so well as to give him that\\nsimple acknowledgement of acquaintance and she was just in time\\nby a side glance to see a slight curtsey from Elizabeth herself\\nThis though late and reluctant and ungracious was yet\\nbetter than nothing and her spirits improved\\n\\nAfter talking however of the weather and Bath and the concert\\ntheir conversation began to flag and so little was said at last\\nthat she was expecting him to go every moment but he did not\\nhe seemed in no hurry to leave her and presently with renewed spirit\\nwith a little smile a little glow he said\\n\\nI have hardly seen you since our day at Lyme  I am afraid you must have\\nsuffered from the shock and the more from its not overpowering you\\nat the time\\n\\nShe assured him that she had not\\n\\nIt was a frightful hour said he a frightful day and he\\npassed his hand across his eyes as if the remembrance were still\\ntoo painful but in a moment half smiling again added\\nThe day has produced some effects however has had some consequences\\nwhich must be considered as the very reverse of frightful\\nWhen you had the presence of mind to suggest that Benwick would be\\nthe properest person to fetch a surgeon you could have little idea\\nof his being eventually one of those most concerned in her recovery\\n\\nCertainly I could have none  But it appearsI should hope it would be\\na very happy match  There are on both sides good principles\\nand good temper\\n\\nYes said he looking not exactly forward but there I think\\nends the resemblance  With all my soul I wish them happy and rejoice\\nover every circumstance in favour of it  They have no difficulties\\nto contend with at home no opposition no caprice no delays\\nThe Musgroves are behaving like themselves most honourably and kindly\\nonly anxious with true parental hearts to promote their daughters comfort\\nAll this is much very much in favour of their happiness\\nmore than perhaps\\n\\nHe stopped  A sudden recollection seemed to occur and to give him\\nsome taste of that emotion which was reddening Annes cheeks\\nand fixing her eyes on the ground  After clearing his throat however\\nhe proceeded thus\\n\\nI confess that I do think there is a disparity too great a disparity\\nand in a point no less essential than mind  I regard Louisa Musgrove\\nas a very amiable sweettempered girl and not deficient in understanding\\nbut Benwick is something more  He is a clever man a reading man\\nand I confess that I do consider his attaching himself to her\\nwith some surprise  Had it been the effect of gratitude\\nhad he learnt to love her because he believed her to be preferring him\\nit would have been another thing  But I have no reason to suppose it so\\nIt seems on the contrary to have been a perfectly spontaneous\\nuntaught feeling on his side and this surprises me  A man like him\\nin his situation with a heart pierced wounded almost broken\\nFanny Harville was a very superior creature and his attachment to her\\nwas indeed attachment  A man does not recover from such\\na devotion of the heart to such a woman  He ought not he does not\\n\\nEither from the consciousness however that his friend had recovered\\nor from other consciousness he went no farther and Anne who\\nin spite of the agitated voice in which the latter part had been uttered\\nand in spite of all the various noises of the room the almost ceaseless\\nslam of the door and ceaseless buzz of persons walking through\\nhad distinguished every word was struck gratified confused\\nand beginning to breathe very quick and feel an hundred things\\nin a moment  It was impossible for her to enter on such a subject\\nand yet after a pause feeling the necessity of speaking\\nand having not the smallest wish for a total change she only deviated\\nso far as to say\\n\\nYou were a good while at Lyme I think\\n\\nAbout a fortnight  I could not leave it till Louisas doing well\\nwas quite ascertained  I had been too deeply concerned in the mischief\\nto be soon at peace  It had been my doing solely mine\\nShe would not have been obstinate if I had not been weak\\nThe country round Lyme is very fine  I walked and rode a great deal\\nand the more I saw the more I found to admire\\n\\nI should very much like to see Lyme again said Anne\\n\\nIndeed  I should not have supposed that you could have found\\nanything in Lyme to inspire such a feeling  The horror and distress\\nyou were involved in the stretch of mind the wear of spirits\\nI should have thought your last impressions of Lyme must have been\\nstrong disgust\\n\\nThe last hours were certainly very painful replied Anne\\nbut when pain is over the remembrance of it often becomes a pleasure\\nOne does not love a place the less for having suffered in it\\nunless it has been all suffering nothing but suffering which was\\nby no means the case at Lyme  We were only in anxiety and distress\\nduring the last two hours and previously there had been a great deal\\nof enjoyment  So much novelty and beauty I have travelled so little\\nthat every fresh place would be interesting to me but there is real beauty\\nat Lyme and in short with a faint blush at some recollections\\naltogether my impressions of the place are very agreeable\\n\\nAs she ceased the entrance door opened again and the very party appeared\\nfor whom they were waiting  Lady Dalrymple Lady Dalrymple\\nwas the rejoicing sound and with all the eagerness compatible\\nwith anxious elegance Sir Walter and his two ladies stepped forward\\nto meet her  Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret escorted by Mr Elliot\\nand Colonel Wallis who had happened to arrive nearly at the same instant\\nadvanced into the room  The others joined them and it was\\na group in which Anne found herself also necessarily included\\nShe was divided from Captain Wentworth  Their interesting\\nalmost too interesting conversation must be broken up for a time\\nbut slight was the penance compared with the happiness which brought it on\\nShe had learnt in the last ten minutes more of his feelings\\ntowards Louisa more of all his feelings than she dared to think of\\nand she gave herself up to the demands of the party to the needful\\ncivilities of the moment with exquisite though agitated sensations\\nShe was in good humour with all  She had received ideas which\\ndisposed her to be courteous and kind to all and to pity every one\\nas being less happy than herself\\n\\nThe delightful emotions were a little subdued when on stepping back\\nfrom the group to be joined again by Captain Wentworth she saw\\nthat he was gone  She was just in time to see him turn into\\nthe Concert Room  He was gone he had disappeared she felt\\na moments regret  But they should meet again  He would look for her\\nhe would find her out before the evening were over and at present\\nperhaps it was as well to be asunder  She was in need of\\na little interval for recollection\\n\\nUpon Lady Russells appearance soon afterwards the whole party\\nwas collected and all that remained was to marshal themselves\\nand proceed into the Concert Room and be of all the consequence\\nin their power draw as many eyes excite as many whispers\\nand disturb as many people as they could\\n\\nVery very happy were both Elizabeth and Anne Elliot as they walked in\\nElizabeth arm in arm with Miss Carteret and looking on the broad back\\nof the dowager Viscountess Dalrymple before her had nothing to wish for\\nwhich did not seem within her reach and Annebut it would be\\nan insult to the nature of Annes felicity to draw any comparison\\nbetween it and her sisters the origin of one all selfish vanity\\nof the other all generous attachment\\n\\nAnne saw nothing thought nothing of the brilliancy of the room\\nHer happiness was from within  Her eyes were bright and her cheeks glowed\\nbut she knew nothing about it  She was thinking only of\\nthe last half hour and as they passed to their seats her mind took\\na hasty range over it  His choice of subjects his expressions\\nand still more his manner and look had been such as she could see\\nin only one light  His opinion of Louisa Musgroves inferiority\\nan opinion which he had seemed solicitous to give his wonder\\nat Captain Benwick his feelings as to a first strong attachment\\nsentences begun which he could not finish his half averted eyes\\nand more than half expressive glance all all declared that he had\\na heart returning to her at least that anger resentment avoidance\\nwere no more and that they were succeeded not merely by friendship\\nand regard but by the tenderness of the past  Yes some share of\\nthe tenderness of the past  She could not contemplate the change\\nas implying less  He must love her\\n\\nThese were thoughts with their attendant visions which occupied\\nand flurried her too much to leave her any power of observation\\nand she passed along the room without having a glimpse of him\\nwithout even trying to discern him  When their places were determined on\\nand they were all properly arranged she looked round to see\\nif he should happen to be in the same part of the room but he was not\\nher eye could not reach him and the concert being just opening\\nshe must consent for a time to be happy in a humbler way\\n\\nThe party was divided and disposed of on two contiguous benches\\nAnne was among those on the foremost and Mr Elliot had manoeuvred so well\\nwith the assistance of his friend Colonel Wallis as to have a seat by her\\nMiss Elliot surrounded by her cousins and the principal object\\nof Colonel Walliss gallantry was quite contented\\n\\nAnnes mind was in a most favourable state for the entertainment\\nof the evening it was just occupation enough  she had feelings for\\nthe tender spirits for the gay attention for the scientific\\nand patience for the wearisome and had never liked a concert better\\nat least during the first act  Towards the close of it\\nin the interval succeeding an Italian song she explained\\nthe words of the song to Mr Elliot  They had a concert bill between them\\n\\nThis said she is nearly the sense or rather the meaning of the words\\nfor certainly the sense of an Italian lovesong must not be talked of\\nbut it is as nearly the meaning as I can give for I do not pretend\\nto understand the language  I am a very poor Italian scholar\\n\\nYes yes I see you are  I see you know nothing of the matter\\nYou have only knowledge enough of the language to translate at sight\\nthese inverted transposed curtailed Italian lines into clear\\ncomprehensible elegant English  You need not say anything more\\nof your ignorance  Here is complete proof\\n\\nI will not oppose such kind politeness but I should be sorry to be\\nexamined by a real proficient\\n\\nI have not had the pleasure of visiting in Camden Place so long\\nreplied he without knowing something of Miss Anne Elliot\\nand I do regard her as one who is too modest for the world in general\\nto be aware of half her accomplishments and too highly accomplished\\nfor modesty to be natural in any other woman\\n\\nFor shame for shame this is too much flattery  I forget what we are\\nto have next turning to the bill\\n\\nPerhaps said Mr Elliot speaking low I have had a longer acquaintance\\nwith your character than you are aware of\\n\\nIndeed  How so  You can have been acquainted with it only since\\nI came to Bath excepting as you might hear me previously spoken of\\nin my own family\\n\\nI knew you by report long before you came to Bath  I had heard you\\ndescribed by those who knew you intimately  I have been acquainted\\nwith you by character many years  Your person your disposition\\naccomplishments manner they were all present to me\\n\\nMr Elliot was not disappointed in the interest he hoped to raise\\nNo one can withstand the charm of such a mystery  To have been\\ndescribed long ago to a recent acquaintance by nameless people\\nis irresistible and Anne was all curiosity  She wondered\\nand questioned him eagerly but in vain  He delighted in being asked\\nbut he would not tell\\n\\nNo no some time or other perhaps but not now  He would mention\\nno names now but such he could assure her had been the fact\\nHe had many years ago received such a description of Miss Anne Elliot\\nas had inspired him with the highest idea of her merit and excited\\nthe warmest curiosity to know her\\n\\nAnne could think of no one so likely to have spoken with\\npartiality of her many years ago as the Mr Wentworth of Monkford\\nCaptain Wentworths brother  He might have been in Mr Elliots company\\nbut she had not courage to ask the question\\n\\nThe name of Anne Elliot said he has long had an interesting sound to me\\nVery long has it possessed a charm over my fancy and if I dared\\nI would breathe my wishes that the name might never change\\n\\nSuch she believed were his words but scarcely had she\\nreceived their sound than her attention was caught by other sounds\\nimmediately behind her which rendered every thing else trivial\\nHer father and Lady Dalrymple were speaking\\n\\nA welllooking man said Sir Walter a very welllooking man\\n\\nA very fine young man indeed said Lady Dalrymple  More air\\nthan one often sees in Bath  Irish I dare say\\n\\nNo I just know his name  A bowing acquaintance  Wentworth\\nCaptain Wentworth of the navy  His sister married my tenant\\nin Somersetshire the Croft who rents Kellynch\\n\\nBefore Sir Walter had reached this point Annes eyes had caught\\nthe right direction and distinguished Captain Wentworth standing\\namong a cluster of men at a little distance  As her eyes fell on him\\nhis seemed to be withdrawn from her  It had that appearance\\nIt seemed as if she had been one moment too late and as long as she\\ndared observe he did not look again  but the performance\\nwas recommencing and she was forced to seem to restore her attention\\nto the orchestra and look straight forward\\n\\nWhen she could give another glance he had moved away  He could not have\\ncome nearer to her if he would she was so surrounded and shut in\\nbut she would rather have caught his eye\\n\\nMr Elliots speech too distressed her  She had no longer\\nany inclination to talk to him  She wished him not so near her\\n\\nThe first act was over  Now she hoped for some beneficial change\\nand after a period of nothingsaying amongst the party some of them\\ndid decide on going in quest of tea  Anne was one of the few who\\ndid not choose to move  She remained in her seat and so did Lady Russell\\nbut she had the pleasure of getting rid of Mr Elliot and she did not mean\\nwhatever she might feel on Lady Russells account to shrink from\\nconversation with Captain Wentworth if he gave her the opportunity\\nShe was persuaded by Lady Russells countenance that she had seen him\\n\\nHe did not come however  Anne sometimes fancied she discerned him\\nat a distance but he never came  The anxious interval\\nwore away unproductively  The others returned the room filled again\\nbenches were reclaimed and repossessed and another hour of pleasure\\nor of penance was to be sat out another hour of music was to give\\ndelight or the gapes as real or affected taste for it prevailed\\nTo Anne it chiefly wore the prospect of an hour of agitation\\nShe could not quit that room in peace without seeing Captain Wentworth\\nonce more without the interchange of one friendly look\\n\\nIn resettling themselves there were now many changes the result of which\\nwas favourable for her  Colonel Wallis declined sitting down again\\nand Mr Elliot was invited by Elizabeth and Miss Carteret in a manner\\nnot to be refused to sit between them and by some other removals\\nand a little scheming of her own  Anne was enabled to place herself\\nmuch nearer the end of the bench than she had been before\\nmuch more within reach of a passerby  She could not do so\\nwithout comparing herself with Miss Larolles the inimitable Miss Larolles\\nbut still she did it and not with much happier effect\\nthough by what seemed prosperity in the shape of an early abdication\\nin her next neighbours she found herself at the very end of the bench\\nbefore the concert closed\\n\\nSuch was her situation with a vacant space at hand when Captain Wentworth\\nwas again in sight  She saw him not far off  He saw her too\\nyet he looked grave and seemed irresolute and only by very slow degrees\\ncame at last near enough to speak to her  She felt that something\\nmust be the matter  The change was indubitable  The difference\\nbetween his present air and what it had been in the Octagon Room\\nwas strikingly great  Why was it  She thought of her father\\nof Lady Russell  Could there have been any unpleasant glances\\nHe began by speaking of the concert gravely more like the Captain\\nWentworth of Uppercross owned himself disappointed had expected singing\\nand in short must confess that he should not be sorry when it was over\\nAnne replied and spoke in defence of the performance so well\\nand yet in allowance for his feelings so pleasantly that his countenance\\nimproved and he replied again with almost a smile  They talked\\nfor a few minutes more the improvement held he even looked down\\ntowards the bench as if he saw a place on it well worth occupying\\nwhen at that moment a touch on her shoulder obliged Anne to turn round\\nIt came from Mr Elliot  He begged her pardon but she must be applied to\\nto explain Italian again  Miss Carteret was very anxious to have\\na general idea of what was next to be sung  Anne could not refuse\\nbut never had she sacrificed to politeness with a more suffering spirit\\n\\nA few minutes though as few as possible were inevitably consumed\\nand when her own mistress again when able to turn and look\\nas she had done before she found herself accosted by Captain Wentworth\\nin a reserved yet hurried sort of farewell  He must wish her good night\\nhe was going he should get home as fast as he could\\n\\nIs not this song worth staying for said Anne suddenly struck\\nby an idea which made her yet more anxious to be encouraging\\n\\nNo he replied impressively there is nothing worth my staying for\\nand he was gone directly\\n\\nJealousy of Mr Elliot  It was the only intelligible motive\\nCaptain Wentworth jealous of her affection  Could she have believed it\\na week ago three hours ago  For a moment the gratification was exquisite\\nBut alas there were very different thoughts to succeed\\nHow was such jealousy to be quieted  How was the truth to reach him\\nHow in all the peculiar disadvantages of their respective situations\\nwould he ever learn of her real sentiments  It was misery to think\\nof Mr Elliots attentions  Their evil was incalculable\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 21\\n\\n\\nAnne recollected with pleasure the next morning her promise\\nof going to Mrs Smith meaning that it should engage her from home\\nat the time when Mr Elliot would be most likely to call for to avoid\\nMr Elliot was almost a first object\\n\\nShe felt a great deal of goodwill towards him  In spite of\\nthe mischief of his attentions she owed him gratitude and regard\\nperhaps compassion  She could not help thinking much of the extraordinary\\ncircumstances attending their acquaintance of the right which\\nhe seemed to have to interest her by everything in situation\\nby his own sentiments by his early prepossession  It was altogether\\nvery extraordinary flattering but painful  There was much to regret\\nHow she might have felt had there been no Captain Wentworth in the case\\nwas not worth enquiry for there was a Captain Wentworth\\nand be the conclusion of the present suspense good or bad\\nher affection would be his for ever  Their union she believed\\ncould not divide her more from other men than their final separation\\n\\nPrettier musings of highwrought love and eternal constancy\\ncould never have passed along the streets of Bath than Anne\\nwas sporting with from Camden Place to Westgate Buildings\\nIt was almost enough to spread purification and perfume all the way\\n\\nShe was sure of a pleasant reception and her friend seemed this morning\\nparticularly obliged to her for coming seemed hardly to have expected her\\nthough it had been an appointment\\n\\nAn account of the concert was immediately claimed and Annes recollections\\nof the concert were quite happy enough to animate her features\\nand make her rejoice to talk of it  All that she could tell\\nshe told most gladly but the all was little for one who had been there\\nand unsatisfactory for such an enquirer as Mrs Smith who had\\nalready heard through the short cut of a laundress and a waiter\\nrather more of the general success and produce of the evening\\nthan Anne could relate and who now asked in vain for several particulars\\nof the company  Everybody of any consequence or notoriety in Bath\\nwas well know by name to Mrs Smith\\n\\nThe little Durands were there I conclude said she with their mouths\\nopen to catch the music like unfledged sparrows ready to be fed\\nThey never miss a concert\\n\\nYes I did not see them myself but I heard Mr Elliot say they were\\nin the room\\n\\nThe Ibbotsons were they there and the two new beauties\\nwith the tall Irish officer who is talked of for one of them\\n\\nI do not know  I do not think they were\\n\\nOld Lady Mary Maclean  I need not ask after her  She never misses\\nI know and you must have seen her  She must have been in your own circle\\nfor as you went with Lady Dalrymple you were in the seats of grandeur\\nround the orchestra of course\\n\\nNo that was what I dreaded  It would have been very unpleasant to me\\nin every respect  But happily Lady Dalrymple always chooses\\nto be farther off and we were exceedingly well placed that is\\nfor hearing I must not say for seeing because I appear to have seen\\nvery little\\n\\nOh you saw enough for your own amusement  I can understand\\nThere is a sort of domestic enjoyment to be known even in a crowd\\nand this you had  You were a large party in yourselves\\nand you wanted nothing beyond\\n\\nBut I ought to have looked about me more said Anne conscious\\nwhile she spoke that there had in fact been no want of looking about\\nthat the object only had been deficient\\n\\nNo no you were better employed  You need not tell me that you\\nhad a pleasant evening  I see it in your eye  I perfectly see\\nhow the hours passed  that you had always something agreeable\\nto listen to  In the intervals of the concert it was conversation\\n\\nAnne half smiled and said Do you see that in my eye\\n\\nYes I do  Your countenance perfectly informs me that you were\\nin company last night with the person whom you think the most agreeable\\nin the world the person who interests you at this present time\\nmore than all the rest of the world put together\\n\\nA blush overspread Annes cheeks  She could say nothing\\n\\nAnd such being the case continued Mrs Smith after a short pause\\nI hope you believe that I do know how to value your kindness\\nin coming to me this morning  It is really very good of you\\nto come and sit with me when you must have so many pleasanter demands\\nupon your time\\n\\nAnne heard nothing of this  She was still in the astonishment and\\nconfusion excited by her friends penetration unable to imagine\\nhow any report of Captain Wentworth could have reached her\\nAfter another short silence\\n\\nPray said Mrs Smith is Mr Elliot aware of your acquaintance with me\\nDoes he know that I am in Bath\\n\\nMr Elliot repeated Anne looking up surprised  A moments reflection\\nshewed her the mistake she had been under  She caught it instantaneously\\nand recovering her courage with the feeling of safety soon added\\nmore composedly Are you acquainted with Mr Elliot\\n\\nI have been a good deal acquainted with him replied Mrs Smith gravely\\nbut it seems worn out now  It is a great while since we met\\n\\nI was not at all aware of this  You never mentioned it before\\nHad I known it I would have had the pleasure of talking to him about you\\n\\nTo confess the truth said Mrs Smith assuming her usual\\nair of cheerfulness that is exactly the pleasure I want you to have\\nI want you to talk about me to Mr Elliot  I want your interest with him\\nHe can be of essential service to me and if you would have the goodness\\nmy dear Miss Elliot to make it an object to yourself\\nof course it is done\\n\\nI should be extremely happy I hope you cannot doubt my willingness\\nto be of even the slightest use to you replied Anne but I suspect\\nthat you are considering me as having a higher claim on Mr Elliot\\na greater right to influence him than is really the case\\nI am sure you have somehow or other imbibed such a notion\\nYou must consider me only as Mr Elliots relation  If in that light\\nthere is anything which you suppose his cousin might fairly ask of him\\nI beg you would not hesitate to employ me\\n\\nMrs Smith gave her a penetrating glance and then smiling said\\n\\nI have been a little premature I perceive I beg your pardon\\nI ought to have waited for official information  But now my dear\\nMiss Elliot as an old friend do give me a hint as to when I may speak\\nNext week  To be sure by next week I may be allowed to\\nthink it all settled and build my own selfish schemes on\\nMr Elliots good fortune\\n\\nNo replied Anne nor next week nor next nor next\\nI assure you that nothing of the sort you are thinking of\\nwill be settled any week  I am not going to marry Mr Elliot\\nI should like to know why you imagine I am\\n\\nMrs Smith looked at her again looked earnestly smiled\\nshook her head and exclaimed\\n\\nNow how I do wish I understood you  How I do wish I knew\\nwhat you were at  I have a great idea that you do not design to be cruel\\nwhen the right moment occurs  Till it does come you know\\nwe women never mean to have anybody  It is a thing of course among us\\nthat every man is refused till he offers  But why should you be cruel\\nLet me plead for mypresent friend I cannot call him but for\\nmy former friend  Where can you look for a more suitable match\\nWhere could you expect a more gentlemanlike agreeable man\\nLet me recommend Mr Elliot  I am sure you hear nothing but good of him\\nfrom Colonel Wallis and who can know him better than Colonel Wallis\\n\\nMy dear Mrs Smith Mr Elliots wife has not been dead much above\\nhalf a year  He ought not to be supposed to be paying his addresses\\nto any one\\n\\nOh if these are your only objections cried Mrs Smith archly\\nMr Elliot is safe and I shall give myself no more trouble about him\\nDo not forget me when you are married thats all  Let him know me to be\\na friend of yours and then he will think little of the trouble required\\nwhich it is very natural for him now with so many affairs and engagements\\nof his own to avoid and get rid of as he can very natural perhaps\\nNinetynine out of a hundred would do the same  Of course\\nhe cannot be aware of the importance to me  Well my dear Miss Elliot\\nI hope and trust you will be very happy  Mr Elliot has sense\\nto understand the value of such a woman  Your peace will not be\\nshipwrecked as mine has been  You are safe in all worldly matters\\nand safe in his character  He will not be led astray he will not be\\nmisled by others to his ruin\\n\\nNo said Anne I can readily believe all that of my cousin\\nHe seems to have a calm decided temper not at all open\\nto dangerous impressions  I consider him with great respect\\nI have no reason from any thing that has fallen within my observation\\nto do otherwise  But I have not known him long and he is not a man\\nI think to be known intimately soon  Will not this manner\\nof speaking of him Mrs Smith convince you that he is nothing to me\\nSurely this must be calm enough  And upon my word he is nothing to me\\nShould he ever propose to me which I have very little reason to imagine\\nhe has any thought of doing I shall not accept him  I assure you\\nI shall not  I assure you Mr Elliot had not the share which\\nyou have been supposing in whatever pleasure the concert\\nof last night might afford  not Mr Elliot it is not Mr Elliot that\\n\\nShe stopped regretting with a deep blush that she had implied so much\\nbut less would hardly have been sufficient  Mrs Smith would hardly\\nhave believed so soon in Mr Elliots failure but from the perception\\nof there being a somebody else  As it was she instantly submitted\\nand with all the semblance of seeing nothing beyond and Anne\\neager to escape farther notice was impatient to know why Mrs Smith\\nshould have fancied she was to marry Mr Elliot where she could have\\nreceived the idea or from whom she could have heard it\\n\\nDo tell me how it first came into your head\\n\\nIt first came into my head replied Mrs Smith upon finding how much\\nyou were together and feeling it to be the most probable thing\\nin the world to be wished for by everybody belonging to either of you\\nand you may depend upon it that all your acquaintance have disposed of you\\nin the same way  But I never heard it spoken of till two days ago\\n\\nAnd has it indeed been spoken of\\n\\nDid you observe the woman who opened the door to you when\\nyou called yesterday\\n\\nNo  Was not it Mrs Speed as usual or the maid  I observed\\nno one in particular\\n\\nIt was my friend Mrs Rooke Nurse Rooke who bythebye\\nhad a great curiosity to see you and was delighted to be in the way\\nto let you in  She came away from Marlborough Buildings only on Sunday\\nand she it was who told me you were to marry Mr Elliot\\nShe had had it from Mrs Wallis herself which did not seem bad authority\\nShe sat an hour with me on Monday evening and gave me the whole history\\nThe whole history repeated Anne laughing  She could not make\\na very long history I think of one such little article\\nof unfounded news\\n\\nMrs Smith said nothing\\n\\nBut continued Anne presently though there is no truth in my having\\nthis claim on Mr Elliot I should be extremely happy to be of use to you\\nin any way that I could  Shall I mention to him your being in Bath\\nShall I take any message\\n\\nNo I thank you  no certainly not  In the warmth of the moment\\nand under a mistaken impression I might perhaps have endeavoured\\nto interest you in some circumstances but not now  No I thank you\\nI have nothing to trouble you with\\n\\nI think you spoke of having known Mr Elliot many years\\n\\nI did\\n\\nNot before he was married I suppose\\n\\nYes he was not married when I knew him first\\n\\nAndwere you much acquainted\\n\\nIntimately\\n\\nIndeed  Then do tell me what he was at that time of life\\nI have a great curiosity to know what Mr Elliot was as a very young man\\nWas he at all such as he appears now\\n\\nI have not seen Mr Elliot these three years was Mrs Smiths answer\\ngiven so gravely that it was impossible to pursue the subject farther\\nand Anne felt that she had gained nothing but an increase of curiosity\\nThey were both silent  Mrs Smith very thoughtful  At last\\n\\nI beg your pardon my dear Miss Elliot she cried in her\\nnatural tone of cordiality I beg your pardon for the short answers\\nI have been giving you but I have been uncertain what I ought to do\\nI have been doubting and considering as to what I ought to tell you\\nThere were many things to be taken into the account  One hates\\nto be officious to be giving bad impressions making mischief\\nEven the smooth surface of familyunion seems worth preserving\\nthough there may be nothing durable beneath  However I have determined\\nI think I am right I think you ought to be made acquainted\\nwith Mr Elliots real character  Though I fully believe that\\nat present you have not the smallest intention of accepting him\\nthere is no saying what may happen  You might some time or other\\nbe differently affected towards him  Hear the truth therefore\\nnow while you are unprejudiced  Mr Elliot is a man without heart\\nor conscience a designing wary coldblooded being who thinks\\nonly of himself whom for his own interest or ease would be guilty\\nof any cruelty or any treachery that could be perpetrated without\\nrisk of his general character  He has no feeling for others\\nThose whom he has been the chief cause of leading into ruin\\nhe can neglect and desert without the smallest compunction\\nHe is totally beyond the reach of any sentiment of justice or compassion\\nOh he is black at heart hollow and black\\n\\nAnnes astonished air and exclamation of wonder made her pause\\nand in a calmer manner she added\\n\\nMy expressions startle you  You must allow for an injured angry woman\\nBut I will try to command myself  I will not abuse him\\nI will only tell you what I have found him  Facts shall speak\\nHe was the intimate friend of my dear husband who trusted and loved him\\nand thought him as good as himself  The intimacy had been formed\\nbefore our marriage  I found them most intimate friends and I too\\nbecame excessively pleased with Mr Elliot and entertained\\nthe highest opinion of him  At nineteen you know one does not\\nthink very seriously but Mr Elliot appeared to me quite as good as others\\nand much more agreeable than most others and we were almost\\nalways together  We were principally in town living in very good style\\nHe was then the inferior in circumstances he was then the poor one\\nhe had chambers in the Temple and it was as much as he could do\\nto support the appearance of a gentleman  He had always a home\\nwith us whenever he chose it he was always welcome he was like a brother\\nMy poor Charles who had the finest most generous spirit in the world\\nwould have divided his last farthing with him and I know that his purse\\nwas open to him I know that he often assisted him\\n\\nThis must have been about that very period of Mr Elliots life\\nsaid Anne which has always excited my particular curiosity\\nIt must have been about the same time that he became known to\\nmy father and sister  I never knew him myself I only heard of him\\nbut there was a something in his conduct then with regard to\\nmy father and sister and afterwards in the circumstances of his marriage\\nwhich I never could quite reconcile with present times  It seemed\\nto announce a different sort of man\\n\\nI know it all I know it all cried Mrs Smith  He had been\\nintroduced to Sir Walter and your sister before I was acquainted with him\\nbut I heard him speak of them for ever  I know he was invited\\nand encouraged and I know he did not choose to go  I can satisfy you\\nperhaps on points which you would little expect and as to his marriage\\nI knew all about it at the time  I was privy to all the fors and againsts\\nI was the friend to whom he confided his hopes and plans and though\\nI did not know his wife previously her inferior situation in society\\nindeed rendered that impossible yet I knew her all her life afterwards\\nor at least till within the last two years of her life and can answer\\nany question you may wish to put\\n\\nNay said Anne I have no particular enquiry to make about her\\nI have always understood they were not a happy couple  But I should\\nlike to know why at that time of his life he should slight\\nmy fathers acquaintance as he did  My father was certainly disposed\\nto take very kind and proper notice of him  Why did Mr Elliot draw back\\n\\nMr Elliot replied Mrs Smith at that period of his life\\nhad one object in view  to make his fortune and by a rather quicker\\nprocess than the law  He was determined to make it by marriage\\nHe was determined at least not to mar it by an imprudent marriage\\nand I know it was his belief whether justly or not of course\\nI cannot decide that your father and sister in their civilities\\nand invitations were designing a match between the heir\\nand the young lady and it was impossible that such a match\\nshould have answered his ideas of wealth and independence\\nThat was his motive for drawing back I can assure you\\nHe told me the whole story  He had no concealments with me\\nIt was curious that having just left you behind me in Bath\\nmy first and principal acquaintance on marrying should be your cousin\\nand that through him I should be continually hearing of your father\\nand sister  He described one Miss Elliot and I thought\\nvery affectionately of the other\\n\\nPerhaps cried Anne struck by a sudden idea you sometimes\\nspoke of me to Mr Elliot\\n\\nTo be sure I did very often  I used to boast of my own Anne Elliot\\nand vouch for your being a very different creature from\\n\\nShe checked herself just in time\\n\\nThis accounts for something which Mr Elliot said last night\\ncried Anne  This explains it  I found he had been used to hear of me\\nI could not comprehend how  What wild imaginations one forms where\\ndear self is concerned  How sure to be mistaken  But I beg your pardon\\nI have interrupted you  Mr Elliot married then completely for money\\nThe circumstances probably which first opened your eyes\\nto his character\\n\\nMrs Smith hesitated a little here  Oh those things are too common\\nWhen one lives in the world a man or womans marrying for money\\nis too common to strike one as it ought  I was very young\\nand associated only with the young and we were a thoughtless\\ngay set without any strict rules of conduct  We lived for enjoyment\\nI think differently now time and sickness and sorrow have given me\\nother notions but at that period I must own I saw nothing reprehensible\\nin what Mr Elliot was doing  To do the best for himself\\npassed as a duty\\n\\nBut was not she a very low woman\\n\\nYes which I objected to but he would not regard  Money money\\nwas all that he wanted  Her father was a grazier her grandfather\\nhad been a butcher but that was all nothing  She was a fine woman\\nhad had a decent education was brought forward by some cousins\\nthrown by chance into Mr Elliots company and fell in love with him\\nand not a difficulty or a scruple was there on his side\\nwith respect to her birth  All his caution was spent in being secured\\nof the real amount of her fortune before he committed himself\\nDepend upon it whatever esteem Mr Elliot may have for his own situation\\nin life now as a young man he had not the smallest value for it\\nHis chance for the Kellynch estate was something but all the honour\\nof the family he held as cheap as dirt  I have often heard him declare\\nthat if baronetcies were saleable anybody should have his\\nfor fifty pounds arms and motto name and livery included\\nbut I will not pretend to repeat half that I used to hear him say\\non that subject  It would not be fair and yet you ought to have proof\\nfor what is all this but assertion and you shall have proof\\n\\nIndeed my dear Mrs Smith I want none cried Anne  You have asserted\\nnothing contradictory to what Mr Elliot appeared to be some years ago\\nThis is all in confirmation rather of what we used to hear and believe\\nI am more curious to know why he should be so different now\\n\\nBut for my satisfaction if you will have the goodness to ring for Mary\\nstay  I am sure you will have the still greater goodness of\\ngoing yourself into my bedroom and bringing me the small inlaid box\\nwhich you will find on the upper shelf of the closet\\n\\nAnne seeing her friend to be earnestly bent on it did as she was desired\\nThe box was brought and placed before her and Mrs Smith sighing over it\\nas she unlocked it said\\n\\nThis is full of papers belonging to him to my husband\\na small portion only of what I had to look over when I lost him\\nThe letter I am looking for was one written by Mr Elliot to him\\nbefore our marriage and happened to be saved why one can hardly imagine\\nBut he was careless and immethodical like other men about those things\\nand when I came to examine his papers I found it with others\\nstill more trivial from different people scattered here and there\\nwhile many letters and memorandums of real importance had been destroyed\\nHere it is I would not burn it because being even then very little\\nsatisfied with Mr Elliot I was determined to preserve every document\\nof former intimacy  I have now another motive for being glad\\nthat I can produce it\\n\\nThis was the letter directed to Charles Smith Esq Tunbridge Wells\\nand dated from London as far back as July 1803 \\n\\nDear SmithI have received yours  Your kindness almost overpowers me\\nI wish nature had made such hearts as yours more common but I have\\nlived threeandtwenty years in the world and have seen none like it\\nAt present believe me I have no need of your services\\nbeing in cash again  Give me joy  I have got rid of Sir Walter and Miss\\nThey are gone back to Kellynch and almost made me swear to visit them\\nthis summer but my first visit to Kellynch will be with a surveyor\\nto tell me how to bring it with best advantage to the hammer\\nThe baronet nevertheless is not unlikely to marry again\\nhe is quite fool enough  If he does however they will leave me in peace\\nwhich may be a decent equivalent  for the reversion  He is worse\\nthan last year\\n\\nI wish I had any name but Elliot  I am sick of it  The name of Walter\\nI can drop thank God and I desire you will never insult me\\nwith my second W again meaning for the rest of my life\\nto be only yours trulyWm Elliot\\n\\nSuch a letter could not be read without putting Anne in a glow\\nand Mrs Smith observing the high colour in her face said\\n\\nThe language I know is highly disrespectful  Though I have forgot\\nthe exact terms I have a perfect impression of the general meaning\\nBut it shows you the man  Mark his professions to my poor husband\\nCan any thing be stronger\\n\\nAnne could not immediately get over the shock and mortification\\nof finding such words applied to her father  She was obliged to recollect\\nthat her seeing the letter was a violation of the laws of honour\\nthat no one ought to be judged or to be known by such testimonies\\nthat no private correspondence could bear the eye of others\\nbefore she could recover calmness enough to return the letter\\nwhich she had been meditating over and say\\n\\nThank you  This is full proof undoubtedly proof of every thing\\nyou were saying  But why be acquainted with us now\\n\\nI can explain this too cried Mrs Smith smiling\\n\\nCan you really\\n\\nYes  I have shewn you Mr Elliot as he was a dozen years ago\\nand I will shew him as he is now  I cannot produce written proof again\\nbut I can give as authentic oral testimony as you can desire of what\\nhe is now wanting and what he is now doing  He is no hypocrite now\\nHe truly wants to marry you  His present attentions to your family\\nare very sincere  quite from the heart  I will give you my authority\\nhis friend Colonel Wallis\\n\\nColonel Wallis you are acquainted with him\\n\\nNo  It does not come to me in quite so direct a line as that\\nit takes a bend or two but nothing of consequence  The stream\\nis as good as at first the little rubbish it collects in the turnings\\nis easily moved away  Mr Elliot talks unreservedly to Colonel Wallis\\nof his views on you which said Colonel Wallis I imagine to be\\nin himself a sensible careful discerning sort of character\\nbut Colonel Wallis has a very pretty silly wife to whom\\nhe tells things which he had better not and he repeats it all to her\\nShe in the overflowing spirits of her recovery repeats it all\\nto her nurse and the nurse  knowing my acquaintance with you\\nvery naturally brings it all to me  On Monday evening my good friend\\nMrs Rooke let me thus much into the secrets of Marlborough Buildings\\nWhen I talked of a whole history therefore you see I was\\nnot romancing so much as you supposed\\n\\nMy dear Mrs Smith your authority is deficient  This will not do\\nMr Elliots having any views on me will not in the least account\\nfor the efforts he made towards a reconciliation with my father\\nThat was all prior to my coming to Bath  I found them on\\nthe most friendly terms when I arrived\\n\\nI know you did I know it all perfectly but\\n\\nIndeed Mrs Smith we must not expect to get real information\\nin such a line  Facts or opinions which are to pass through the hands\\nof so many to be misconceived by folly in one and ignorance in another\\ncan hardly have much truth left\\n\\nOnly give me a hearing  You will soon be able to judge of\\nthe general credit due by listening to some particulars\\nwhich you can yourself immediately contradict or confirm\\nNobody supposes that you were his first inducement  He had seen you\\nindeed before he came to Bath and admired you but without\\nknowing it to be you  So says my historian at least  Is this true\\nDid he see you last summer or autumn somewhere down in the west\\nto use her own words without knowing it to be you\\n\\nHe certainly did  So far it is very true  At Lyme\\nI happened to be at Lyme\\n\\nWell continued Mrs Smith triumphantly grant my friend the credit\\ndue to the establishment of the first point asserted  He saw you then\\nat Lyme and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleased\\nto meet with you again in Camden Place as Miss Anne Elliot\\nand from that moment I have no doubt had a double motive\\nin his visits there  But there was another and an earlier\\nwhich I will now explain  If there is anything in my story which you know\\nto be either false or improbable stop me  My account states\\nthat your sisters friend the lady now staying with you\\nwhom I have heard you mention came to Bath with Miss Elliot and Sir Walter\\nas long ago as September in short when they first came themselves\\nand has been staying there ever since that she is a clever insinuating\\nhandsome woman poor and plausible and altogether such in situation\\nand manner as to give a general idea among Sir Walters acquaintance\\nof her meaning to be Lady Elliot and as general a surprise\\nthat Miss Elliot should be apparently blind to the danger\\n\\nHere Mrs Smith paused a moment but Anne had not a word to say\\nand she continued\\n\\nThis was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family\\nlong before you returned to it and Colonel Wallis had his eye\\nupon your father enough to be sensible of it though he did not then\\nvisit in Camden Place but his regard for Mr Elliot gave him an interest\\nin watching all that was going on there and when Mr Elliot came to Bath\\nfor a day or two as he happened to do a little before Christmas\\nColonel Wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of things\\nand the reports beginning to prevail  Now you are to understand\\nthat time had worked a very material change in Mr Elliots opinions\\nas to the value of a baronetcy  Upon all points of blood and connexion\\nhe is a completely altered man  Having long had as much money\\nas he could spend nothing to wish for on the side of avarice\\nor indulgence he has been gradually learning to pin his happiness\\nupon the consequence he is heir to  I thought it coming on\\nbefore our acquaintance ceased but it is now a confirmed feeling\\nHe cannot bear the idea of not being Sir William  You may guess\\ntherefore that the news he heard from his friend could not be\\nvery agreeable and you may guess what it produced the resolution\\nof coming back to Bath as soon as possible and of fixing himself here\\nfor a time with the view of renewing his former acquaintance\\nand recovering such a footing in the family as might give him the means\\nof ascertaining the degree of his danger and of circumventing the lady\\nif he found it material  This was agreed upon between the two friends\\nas the only thing to be done and Colonel Wallis was to assist\\nin every way that he could  He was to be introduced and Mrs Wallis\\nwas to be introduced and everybody was to be introduced\\nMr Elliot came back accordingly and on application was forgiven\\nas you know and readmitted into the family and there it was\\nhis constant object and his only object till your arrival\\nadded another motive to watch Sir Walter and Mrs Clay\\nHe omitted no opportunity of being with them threw himself in their way\\ncalled at all hours but I need not be particular on this subject\\nYou can imagine what an artful man would do and with this guide\\nperhaps may recollect what you have seen him do\\n\\nYes said Anne you tell me nothing which does not accord with\\nwhat I have known or could imagine  There is always something offensive\\nin the details of cunning  The manoeuvres of selfishness and duplicity\\nmust ever be revolting but I have heard nothing which really surprises me\\nI know those who would be shocked by such a representation of Mr Elliot\\nwho would have difficulty in believing it but I have never been satisfied\\nI have always wanted some other motive for his conduct than appeared\\nI should like to know his present opinion as to the probability\\nof the event he has been in dread of whether he considers the danger\\nto be lessening or not\\n\\nLessening I understand replied Mrs Smith  He thinks Mrs Clay\\nafraid of him aware that he sees through her and not daring to proceed\\nas she might do in his absence  But since he must be absent\\nsome time or other I do not perceive how he can ever be secure\\nwhile she holds her present influence  Mrs Wallis has an amusing idea\\nas nurse tells me that it is to be put into the marriage articles\\nwhen you and Mr Elliot marry that your father is not to marry Mrs Clay\\nA scheme worthy of Mrs Walliss understanding by all accounts\\nbut my sensible nurse Rooke sees the absurdity of it  Why to be sure\\nmaam said she it would not prevent his marrying anybody else\\nAnd indeed to own the truth I do not think nurse in her heart\\nis a very strenuous opposer of Sir Walters making a second match\\nShe must be allowed to be a favourer of matrimony you know\\nand since self will intrude who can say that she may not have\\nsome flying visions of attending the next Lady Elliot through\\nMrs Walliss recommendation\\n\\nI am very glad to know all this said Anne after a little\\nthoughtfulness  It will be more painful to me in some respects\\nto be in company with him but I shall know better what to do\\nMy line of conduct will be more direct  Mr Elliot is evidently\\na disingenuous artificial worldly man who has never had\\nany better principle to guide him than selfishness\\n\\nBut Mr Elliot was not done with  Mrs Smith had been carried away\\nfrom her first direction and Anne had forgotten in the interest\\nof her own family concerns how much had been originally implied\\nagainst him but her attention was now called to the explanation\\nof those first hints and she listened to a recital which\\nif it did not perfectly justify the unqualified bitterness of Mrs Smith\\nproved him to have been very unfeeling in his conduct towards her\\nvery deficient both in justice and compassion\\n\\nShe learned that the intimacy between them continuing unimpaired\\nby Mr Elliots marriage they had been as before always together\\nand Mr Elliot had led his friend into expenses much beyond his fortune\\nMrs Smith did not want to take blame to herself and was most tender\\nof throwing any on her husband but Anne could collect that their income\\nhad never been equal to their style of living and that from the first\\nthere had been a great deal of general and joint extravagance\\nFrom his wifes account of him she could discern Mr Smith to have been\\na man of warm feelings easy temper careless habits and not strong\\nunderstanding much more amiable than his friend and very unlike him\\nled by him and probably despised by him  Mr Elliot raised by\\nhis marriage to great affluence and disposed to every gratification\\nof pleasure and vanity which could be commanded without involving himself\\nfor with all his selfindulgence he had become a prudent man\\nand beginning to be rich just as his friend ought to have found himself\\nto be poor seemed to have had no concern at all for that friends\\nprobable finances but on the contrary had been prompting and\\nencouraging expenses which could end only in ruin and the Smiths\\naccordingly had been ruined\\n\\nThe husband had died just in time to be spared the full knowledge of it\\nThey had previously known embarrassments enough to try the friendship\\nof their friends and to prove that Mr Elliots had better not be tried\\nbut it was not till his death that the wretched state of his affairs\\nwas fully known  With a confidence in Mr Elliots regard\\nmore creditable to his feelings than his judgement Mr Smith had\\nappointed him the executor of his will but Mr Elliot would not act\\nand the difficulties and distress which this refusal had heaped on her\\nin addition to the inevitable sufferings of her situation had been such\\nas could not be related without anguish of spirit or listened to\\nwithout corresponding indignation\\n\\nAnne was shewn some letters of his on the occasion answers to\\nurgent applications from Mrs Smith which all breathed the same\\nstern resolution of not engaging in a fruitless trouble and\\nunder a cold civility the same hardhearted indifference\\nto any of the evils it might bring on her  It was a dreadful picture\\nof ingratitude and inhumanity and Anne felt at some moments\\nthat no flagrant open crime could have been worse  She had a great deal\\nto listen to all the particulars of past sad scenes all the minutiae\\nof distress upon distress which in former conversations had been\\nmerely hinted at were dwelt on now with a natural indulgence\\nAnne could perfectly comprehend the exquisite relief and was only\\nthe more inclined to wonder at the composure of her friends\\nusual state of mind\\n\\nThere was one circumstance in the history of her grievances\\nof particular irritation  She had good reason to believe that\\nsome property of her husband in the West Indies which had been\\nfor many years under a sort of sequestration for the payment\\nof its own incumbrances might be recoverable by proper measures\\nand this property though not large would be enough to make\\nher comparatively rich  But there was nobody to stir in it\\nMr Elliot would do nothing and she could do nothing herself\\nequally disabled from personal exertion by her state of\\nbodily weakness and from employing others by her want of money\\nShe had no natural connexions to assist her even with their counsel\\nand she could not afford to purchase the assistance of the law\\nThis was a cruel aggravation of actually straitened means\\nTo feel that she ought to be in better circumstances\\nthat a little trouble in the right place might do it\\nand to fear that delay might be even weakening her claims\\nwas hard to bear\\n\\nIt was on this point that she had hoped to engage Annes good offices\\nwith Mr Elliot  She had previously in the anticipation\\nof their marriage been very apprehensive of losing her friend by it\\nbut on being assured that he could have made no attempt of that nature\\nsince he did not even know her to be in Bath it immediately occurred\\nthat something might be done in her favour by the influence of the woman\\nhe loved and she had been hastily preparing to interest Annes feelings\\nas far as the observances due to Mr Elliots character would allow\\nwhen Annes refutation of the supposed engagement changed\\nthe face of everything and while it took from her the newformed hope\\nof succeeding in the object of her first anxiety left her at least\\nthe comfort of telling the whole story her own way\\n\\nAfter listening to this full description of Mr Elliot Anne could not but\\nexpress some surprise at Mrs Smiths having spoken of him so favourably\\nin the beginning of their conversation  She had seemed to recommend\\nand praise him\\n\\nMy dear was Mrs Smiths reply there was nothing else to be done\\nI considered your marrying him as certain though he might not yet\\nhave made the offer and I could no more speak the truth of him\\nthan if he had been your husband  My heart bled for you\\nas I talked of happiness and yet he is sensible he is agreeable\\nand with such a woman as you it was not absolutely hopeless\\nHe was very unkind to his first wife  They were wretched together\\nBut she was too ignorant and giddy for respect and he had never loved her\\nI was willing to hope that you must fare better\\n\\nAnne could just acknowledge within herself such a possibility\\nof having been induced to marry him as made her shudder at the idea\\nof the misery which must have followed  It was just possible that\\nshe might have been persuaded by Lady Russell  And under such\\na supposition which would have been most miserable when time had\\ndisclosed all too late\\n\\nIt was very desirable that Lady Russell should be no longer deceived\\nand one of the concluding arrangements of this important conference\\nwhich carried them through the greater part of the morning\\nwas that Anne had full liberty to communicate to her friend\\neverything relative to Mrs Smith in which his conduct was involved\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 22\\n\\n\\nAnne went home to think over all that she had heard  In one point\\nher feelings were relieved by this knowledge of Mr Elliot\\nThere was no longer anything of tenderness due to him  He stood as\\nopposed to Captain Wentworth in all his own unwelcome obtrusiveness\\nand the evil of his attentions last night the irremediable mischief\\nhe might have done was considered with sensations unqualified unperplexed\\nPity for him was all over  But this was the only point of relief\\nIn every other respect in looking around her or penetrating forward\\nshe saw more to distrust and to apprehend  She was concerned\\nfor the disappointment and pain Lady Russell would be feeling\\nfor the mortifications which must be hanging over her father and sister\\nand had all the distress of foreseeing many evils without knowing\\nhow to avert any one of them  She was most thankful for her own\\nknowledge of him  She had never considered herself as entitled to reward\\nfor not slighting an old friend like Mrs Smith but here was\\na reward indeed springing from it  Mrs Smith had been able to tell her\\nwhat no one else could have done  Could the knowledge have\\nbeen extended through her family  But this was a vain idea\\nShe must talk to Lady Russell tell her consult with her\\nand having done her best wait the event with as much composure\\nas possible and after all her greatest want of composure would be\\nin that quarter of the mind which could not be opened to Lady Russell\\nin that flow of anxieties and fears which must be all to herself\\n\\n\\nShe found on reaching home that she had as she intended\\nescaped seeing Mr Elliot that he had called and paid them\\na long morning visit but hardly had she congratulated herself\\nand felt safe when she heard that he was coming again in the evening\\n\\nI had not the smallest intention of asking him said Elizabeth\\nwith affected carelessness but he gave so many hints\\nso Mrs Clay says at least\\n\\nIndeed I do say it  I never saw anybody in my life spell harder\\nfor an invitation  Poor man  I was really in pain for him\\nfor your hardhearted sister Miss Anne seems bent on cruelty\\n\\nOh cried Elizabeth I have been rather too much used to the game\\nto be soon overcome by a gentlemans hints  However when I found\\nhow excessively he was regretting that he should miss my father\\nthis morning I gave way immediately for I would never really omit\\nan opportunity of bring him and Sir Walter together  They appear to\\nso much advantage in company with each other  Each behaving so pleasantly\\nMr Elliot looking up with so much respect\\n\\nQuite delightful cried Mrs Clay not daring however\\nto turn her eyes towards Anne  Exactly like father and son\\nDear Miss Elliot may I not say father and son\\n\\nOh I lay no embargo on any bodys words  If you will have such\\nideas  But upon my word I am scarcely sensible of his attentions\\nbeing beyond those of other men\\n\\nMy dear Miss Elliot exclaimed Mrs Clay lifting her hands and eyes\\nand sinking all the rest of her astonishment in a convenient silence\\n\\nWell my dear Penelope you need not be so alarmed about him\\nI did invite him you know  I sent him away with smiles\\nWhen I found he was really going to his friends at Thornberry Park\\nfor the whole day tomorrow I had compassion on him\\n\\nAnne admired the good acting of the friend in being able to shew\\nsuch pleasure as she did in the expectation and in the actual arrival\\nof the very person whose presence must really be interfering with\\nher prime object  It was impossible but that Mrs Clay must hate\\nthe sight of Mr Elliot and yet she could assume a most obliging\\nplacid look and appear quite satisfied with the curtailed license\\nof devoting herself only half as much to Sir Walter as she would have\\ndone otherwise\\n\\nTo Anne herself it was most distressing to see Mr Elliot enter the room\\nand quite painful to have him approach and speak to her\\nShe had been used before to feel that he could not be always quite sincere\\nbut now she saw insincerity in everything  His attentive deference\\nto her father contrasted with his former language was odious\\nand when she thought of his cruel conduct towards Mrs Smith\\nshe could hardly bear the sight of his present smiles and mildness\\nor the sound of his artificial good sentiments\\n\\nShe meant to avoid any such alteration of manners as might provoke\\na remonstrance on his side  It was a great object to her to escape\\nall enquiry or eclat but it was her intention to be as decidedly cool\\nto him as might be compatible with their relationship and to retrace\\nas quietly as she could the few steps of unnecessary intimacy she had\\nbeen gradually led along  She was accordingly more guarded\\nand more cool than she had been the night before\\n\\nHe wanted to animate her curiosity again as to how and where\\nhe could have heard her formerly praised wanted very much\\nto be gratified by more solicitation but the charm was broken\\nhe found that the heat and animation of a public room was necessary\\nto kindle his modest cousins vanity he found at least that it was\\nnot to be done now by any of those attempts which he could hazard\\namong the toocommanding claims of the others  He little surmised\\nthat it was a subject acting now exactly against his interest\\nbringing immediately to her thoughts all those parts of his conduct\\nwhich were least excusable\\n\\nShe had some satisfaction in finding that he was really going out of Bath\\nthe next morning going early and that he would be gone the greater part\\nof two days  He was invited again to Camden Place the very evening of\\nhis return but from Thursday to Saturday evening his absence was certain\\nIt was bad enough that a Mrs Clay should be always before her\\nbut that a deeper hypocrite should be added to their party\\nseemed the destruction of everything like peace and comfort\\nIt was so humiliating to reflect on the constant deception practised\\non her father and Elizabeth to consider the various sources\\nof mortification preparing for them  Mrs Clays selfishness was\\nnot so complicate nor so revolting as his and Anne would have compounded\\nfor the marriage at once with all its evils to be clear of Mr Elliots\\nsubtleties in endeavouring to prevent it\\n\\nOn Friday morning she meant to go very early to Lady Russell\\nand accomplish the necessary communication and she would have gone\\ndirectly after breakfast but that Mrs Clay was also going out\\non some obliging purpose of saving her sister trouble which\\ndetermined her to wait till she might be safe from such a companion\\nShe saw Mrs Clay fairly off therefore before she began to talk\\nof spending the morning in Rivers Street\\n\\nVery well said Elizabeth I have nothing to send but my love\\nOh you may as well take back that tiresome book she would lend me\\nand pretend I have read it through  I really cannot be plaguing myself\\nfor ever with all the new poems and states of the nation that come out\\nLady Russell quite bores one with her new publications\\nYou need not tell her so but I thought her dress hideous the other night\\nI used to think she had some taste in dress but I was ashamed of her\\nat the concert  Something so formal and arrange in her air\\nand she sits so upright  My best love of course\\n\\nAnd mine added Sir Walter  Kindest regards  And you may say\\nthat I mean to call upon her soon  Make a civil message\\nbut I shall only leave my card  Morning visits are never fair\\nby women at her time of life who make themselves up so little\\nIf she would only wear rouge she would not be afraid of being seen\\nbut last time I called I observed the blinds were let down immediately\\n\\nWhile her father spoke there was a knock at the door  Who could it be\\nAnne remembering the preconcerted visits at all hours of Mr Elliot\\nwould have expected him but for his known engagement seven miles off\\nAfter the usual period of suspense the usual sounds of approach were heard\\nand Mr and Mrs Charles Musgrove were ushered into the room\\n\\nSurprise was the strongest emotion raised by their appearance\\nbut Anne was really glad to see them and the others were not so sorry\\nbut that they could put on a decent air of welcome and as soon\\nas it became clear that these their nearest relations were not arrived\\nwith an views of accommodation in that house Sir Walter and Elizabeth\\nwere able to rise in cordiality and do the honours of it very well\\nThey were come to Bath for a few days with Mrs Musgrove and were\\nat the White Hart  So much was pretty soon understood\\nbut till Sir Walter and Elizabeth were walking Mary into\\nthe other drawingroom and regaling themselves with her admiration\\nAnne could not draw upon Charless brain for a regular history\\nof their coming or an explanation of some smiling hints\\nof particular business which had been ostentatiously dropped by Mary\\nas well as of some apparent confusion as to whom their party consisted of\\n\\nShe then found that it consisted of Mrs Musgrove Henrietta\\nand Captain Harville beside their two selves  He gave her a very plain\\nintelligible account of the whole a narration in which she saw\\na great deal of most characteristic proceeding  The scheme\\nhad received its first impulse by Captain Harvilles wanting to\\ncome to Bath on business  He had begun to talk of it a week ago\\nand by way of doing something as shooting was over Charles had proposed\\ncoming with him and Mrs Harville had seemed to like the idea of it\\nvery much as an advantage to her husband but Mary could not bear\\nto be left and had made herself so unhappy about it that for a day or two\\neverything seemed to be in suspense or at an end  But then\\nit had been taken up by his father and mother  His mother had\\nsome old friends in Bath whom she wanted to see it was thought\\na good opportunity for Henrietta to come and buy weddingclothes\\nfor herself and her sister and in short it ended in being\\nhis mothers party that everything might be comfortable and easy\\nto Captain Harville and he and Mary were included in it\\nby way of general convenience  They had arrived late the night before\\nMrs Harville her children and Captain Benwick remained with\\nMr Musgrove and Louisa at Uppercross\\n\\nAnnes only surprise was that affairs should be in forwardness enough\\nfor Henriettas weddingclothes to be talked of  She had imagined\\nsuch difficulties of fortune to exist there as must prevent\\nthe marriage from being near at hand but she learned from Charles that\\nvery recently since Marys last letter to herself Charles Hayter\\nhad been applied to by a friend to hold a living for a youth\\nwho could not possibly claim it under many years and that\\non the strength of his present income with almost a certainty\\nof something more permanent long before the term in question\\nthe two families had consented to the young peoples wishes\\nand that their marriage was likely to take place in a few months\\nquite as soon as Louisas  And a very good living it was\\nCharles added  only fiveandtwenty miles from Uppercross\\nand in a very fine country   fine part of Dorsetshire\\nIn the centre of some of the best preserves in the kingdom\\nsurrounded by three great proprietors each more careful and jealous\\nthan the other and to two of the three at least Charles Hayter might get\\na special recommendation  Not that he will value it as he ought\\nhe observed Charles is too cool about sporting Thats the worst of him\\n\\nI am extremely glad indeed cried Anne particularly glad\\nthat this should happen and that of two sisters who both deserve\\nequally well and who have always been such good friends\\nthe pleasant prospect of one should not be dimming those of the other\\nthat they should be so equal in their prosperity and comfort\\nI hope your father and mother are quite happy with regard to both\\n\\nOh yes  My father would be well pleased if the gentlemen were richer\\nbut he has no other fault to find  Money you know coming down with\\nmoneytwo daughters at onceit cannot be a very agreeable operation\\nand it streightens him as to many things  However I do not mean to say\\nthey have not a right to it  It is very fit they should have\\ndaughters shares and I am sure he has always been a very kind\\nliberal father to me  Mary does not above half like Henriettas match\\nShe never did you know  But she does not do him justice\\nnor think enough about Winthrop  I cannot make her attend to\\nthe value of the property  It is a very fair match as times go\\nand I have liked Charles Hayter all my life and I shall not leave off now\\n\\nSuch excellent parents as Mr and Mrs Musgrove exclaimed Anne\\nshould be happy in their childrens marriages  They do everything\\nto confer happiness I am sure  What a blessing to young people\\nto be in such hands  Your father and mother seem so totally free\\nfrom all those ambitious feelings which have led to so much misconduct\\nand misery both in young and old  I hope you think Louisa\\nperfectly recovered now\\n\\nHe answered rather hesitatingly Yes I believe I do very much recovered\\nbut she is altered there is no running or jumping about no laughing\\nor dancing it is quite different  If one happens only to shut the door\\na little hard she starts and wriggles like a young dabchick in the water\\nand Benwick sits at her elbow reading verses or whispering to her\\nall day long\\n\\nAnne could not help laughing  That cannot be much to your taste\\nI know said she but I do believe him to be an excellent young man\\n\\nTo be sure he is  Nobody doubts it and I hope you do not think\\nI am so illiberal as to want every man to have the same objects and\\npleasures as myself  I have a great value for Benwick and when one can\\nbut get him to talk he has plenty to say  His reading has done him\\nno harm for he has fought as well as read  He is a brave fellow\\nI got more acquainted with him last Monday than ever I did before\\nWe had a famous setto at rathunting all the morning in\\nmy fathers great barns and he played his part so well\\nthat I have liked him the better ever since\\n\\nHere they were interrupted by the absolute necessity of Charless\\nfollowing the others to admire mirrors and china but Anne had\\nheard enough to understand the present state of Uppercross\\nand rejoice in its happiness and though she sighed as she rejoiced\\nher sigh had none of the illwill of envy in it  She would certainly\\nhave risen to their blessings if she could but she did not want\\nto lessen theirs\\n\\nThe visit passed off altogether in high good humour  Mary was\\nin excellent spirits enjoying the gaiety and the change\\nand so well satisfied with the journey in her motherinlaws carriage\\nwith four horses and with her own complete independence of Camden Place\\nthat she was exactly in a temper to admire everything as she ought\\nand enter most readily into all the superiorities of the house\\nas they were detailed to her  She had no demands on her father or sister\\nand her consequence was just enough increased by their handsome\\ndrawingrooms\\n\\nElizabeth was for a short time suffering a good deal\\nShe felt that Mrs Musgrove and all her party ought to be asked\\nto dine with them but she could not bear to have the difference of style\\nthe reduction of servants which a dinner must betray witnessed by those\\nwho had been always so inferior to the Elliots of Kellynch\\nIt was a struggle between propriety and vanity but vanity got the better\\nand then Elizabeth was happy again  These were her internal persuasions\\nOld fashioned notions country hospitality we do not profess\\nto give dinners few people in Bath do Lady Alicia never does\\ndid not even ask her own sisters family though they were here a month\\nand I dare say it would be very inconvenient to Mrs Musgrove\\nput her quite out of her way  I am sure she would rather not come\\nshe cannot feel easy with us  I will ask them all for an evening\\nthat will be much better that will be a novelty and a treat\\nThey have not seen two such drawing rooms before  They will be delighted\\nto come tomorrow evening  It shall be a regular party small\\nbut most elegant  And this satisfied Elizabeth  and when the invitation\\nwas given to the two present and promised for the absent\\nMary was as completely satisfied  She was particularly asked\\nto meet Mr Elliot and be introduced to Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret\\nwho were fortunately already engaged to come and she could not\\nhave received a more gratifying attention  Miss Elliot was to have\\nthe honour of calling on Mrs Musgrove in the course of the morning\\nand Anne walked off with Charles and Mary to go and see her\\nand Henrietta directly\\n\\nHer plan of sitting with Lady Russell must give way for the present\\nThey all three called in Rivers Street for a couple of minutes\\nbut Anne convinced herself that a days delay of the intended communication\\ncould be of no consequence and hastened forward to the White Hart\\nto see again the friends and companions of the last autumn\\nwith an eagerness of goodwill which many associations contributed to form\\n\\nThey found Mrs Musgrove and her daughter within and by themselves\\nand Anne had the kindest welcome from each  Henrietta was exactly\\nin that state of recentlyimproved views of freshformed happiness\\nwhich made her full of regard and interest for everybody she had\\never liked before at all and Mrs Musgroves real affection had been won\\nby her usefulness when they were in distress  It was a heartiness\\nand a warmth and a sincerity which Anne delighted in the more\\nfrom the sad want of such blessings at home  She was entreated\\nto give them as much of her time as possible invited for every day\\nand all day long or rather claimed as part of the family and in return\\nshe naturally fell into all her wonted ways of attention and assistance\\nand on Charless leaving them together was listening to Mrs Musgroves\\nhistory of Louisa and to Henriettas of herself giving opinions\\non business and recommendations to shops with intervals of every help\\nwhich Mary required from altering her ribbon to settling her accounts\\nfrom finding her keys and assorting her trinkets to trying\\nto convince her that she was not illused by anybody which Mary\\nwell amused as she generally was in her station at a window\\noverlooking the entrance to the Pump Room could not but have\\nher moments of imagining\\n\\nA morning of thorough confusion was to be expected  A large party\\nin an hotel ensured a quickchanging unsettled scene  One five minutes\\nbrought a note the next a parcel and Anne had not been there\\nhalf an hour when their diningroom spacious as it was\\nseemed more than half filled  a party of steady old friends\\nwere seated around Mrs Musgrove and Charles came back with\\nCaptains Harville and Wentworth  The appearance of the latter\\ncould not be more than the surprise of the moment  It was impossible\\nfor her to have forgotten to feel that this arrival of their\\ncommon friends must be soon bringing them together again\\nTheir last meeting had been most important in opening his feelings\\nshe had derived from it a delightful conviction but she feared\\nfrom his looks that the same unfortunate persuasion which had\\nhastened him away from the Concert Room still governed\\nHe did not seem to want to be near enough for conversation\\n\\nShe tried to be calm and leave things to take their course\\nand tried to dwell much on this argument of rational dependence\\nSurely if there be constant attachment on each side our hearts\\nmust understand each other ere long  We are not boy and girl\\nto be captiously irritable misled by every moments inadvertence\\nand wantonly playing with our own happiness  And yet\\na few minutes afterwards she felt as if their being in company\\nwith each other under their present circumstances could only be\\nexposing them to inadvertencies and misconstructions of the most\\nmischievous kind\\n\\nAnne cried Mary still at her window there is Mrs Clay\\nI am sure standing under the colonnade and a gentleman with her\\nI saw them turn the corner from Bath Street just now  They seemed\\ndeep in talk  Who is it  Come and tell me  Good heavens I recollect\\nIt is Mr Elliot himself\\n\\nNo cried Anne quickly it cannot be Mr Elliot I assure you\\nHe was to leave Bath at nine this morning and does not come back\\ntill tomorrow\\n\\nAs she spoke she felt that Captain Wentworth was looking at her\\nthe consciousness of which vexed and embarrassed her and made her regret\\nthat she had said so much simple as it was\\n\\nMary resenting that she should be supposed not to know her own cousin\\nbegan talking very warmly about the family features and protesting\\nstill more positively that it was Mr Elliot calling again upon Anne\\nto come and look for herself but Anne did not mean to stir\\nand tried to be cool and unconcerned  Her distress returned\\nhowever on perceiving smiles and intelligent glances pass between\\ntwo or three of the lady visitors as if they believed themselves\\nquite in the secret  It was evident that the report concerning her\\nhad spread and a short pause succeeded which seemed to ensure\\nthat it would now spread farther\\n\\nDo come Anne cried Mary come and look yourself  You will be too late\\nif you do not make haste  They are parting they are shaking hands\\nHe is turning away  Not know Mr Elliot indeed  You seem to have\\nforgot all about Lyme\\n\\nTo pacify Mary and perhaps screen her own embarrassment\\nAnne did move quietly to the window  She was just in time to ascertain\\nthat it really was Mr Elliot which she had never believed\\nbefore he disappeared on one side as Mrs Clay walked quickly off\\non the other and checking the surprise which she could not but feel\\nat such an appearance of friendly conference between two persons\\nof totally opposite interest she calmly said Yes it is Mr Elliot\\ncertainly  He has changed his hour of going I suppose that is all\\nor I may be mistaken I might not attend and walked back to her chair\\nrecomposed and with the comfortable hope of having acquitted herself well\\n\\nThe visitors took their leave and Charles having civilly seen them off\\nand then made a face at them and abused them for coming began with\\n\\nWell mother I have done something for you that you will like\\nI have been to the theatre and secured a box for tomorrow night\\nAnt I a good boy  I know you love a play and there is room for us all\\nIt holds nine  I have engaged Captain Wentworth  Anne will\\nnot be sorry to join us I am sure  We all like a play\\nHave not I done well mother\\n\\nMrs Musgrove was good humouredly beginning to express her perfect readiness\\nfor the play if Henrietta and all the others liked it when Mary\\neagerly interrupted her by exclaiming\\n\\nGood heavens Charles how can you think of such a thing\\nTake a box for tomorrow night  Have you forgot that we are engaged\\nto Camden Place tomorrow night and that we were most particularly asked\\nto meet Lady Dalrymple and her daughter and Mr Elliot and all\\nthe principal family connexions on purpose to be introduced to them\\nHow can you be so forgetful\\n\\nPhoo phoo replied Charles whats an evening party\\nNever worth remembering  Your father might have asked us to dinner\\nI think if he had wanted to see us  You may do as you like\\nbut I shall go to the play\\n\\nOh Charles I declare it will be too abominable if you do\\nwhen you promised to go\\n\\nNo I did not promise  I only smirked and bowed and said the word\\nhappy  There was no promise\\n\\nBut you must go Charles  It would be unpardonable to fail\\nWe were asked on purpose to be introduced  There was always\\nsuch a great connexion between the Dalrymples and ourselves\\nNothing ever happened on either side that was not announced immediately\\nWe are quite near relations you know and Mr Elliot too\\nwhom you ought so particularly to be acquainted with  Every attention\\nis due to Mr Elliot  Consider my fathers heir  the future\\nrepresentative of the family\\n\\nDont talk to me about heirs and representatives cried Charles\\nI am not one of those who neglect the reigning power to bow\\nto the rising sun  If I would not go for the sake of your father\\nI should think it scandalous to go for the sake of his heir\\nWhat is Mr Elliot to me  The careless expression was life to Anne\\nwho saw that Captain Wentworth was all attention looking and\\nlistening with his whole soul and that the last words brought\\nhis enquiring eyes from Charles to herself\\n\\nCharles and Mary still talked on in the same style he half serious\\nand half jesting maintaining the scheme for the play and she\\ninvariably serious most warmly opposing it and not omitting\\nto make it known that however determined to go to Camden Place herself\\nshe should not think herself very well used if they went to the play\\nwithout her  Mrs Musgrove interposed\\n\\nWe had better put it off  Charles you had much better go back\\nand change the box for Tuesday  It would be a pity to be divided\\nand we should be losing Miss Anne too if there is a party at her fathers\\nand I am sure neither Henrietta nor I should care at all for the play\\nif Miss Anne could not be with us\\n\\nAnne felt truly obliged to her for such kindness and quite as much\\nso for the opportunity it gave her of decidedly saying\\n\\nIf it depended only on my inclination maam the party at home\\nexcepting on Marys account would not be the smallest impediment\\nI have no pleasure in the sort of meeting and should be too happy\\nto change it for a play and with you  But it had better\\nnot be attempted perhaps  She had spoken it but she trembled\\nwhen it was done conscious that her words were listened to\\nand daring not even to try to observe their effect\\n\\nIt was soon generally agreed that Tuesday should be the day\\nCharles only reserving the advantage of still teasing his wife\\nby persisting that he would go to the play tomorrow if nobody else would\\n\\nCaptain Wentworth left his seat and walked to the fireplace\\nprobably for the sake of walking away from it soon afterwards\\nand taking a station with less barefaced design by Anne\\n\\nYou have not been long enough in Bath said he to enjoy\\nthe evening parties of the place\\n\\nOh no  The usual character of them has nothing for me\\nI am no cardplayer\\n\\nYou were not formerly I know  You did not use to like cards\\nbut time makes many changes\\n\\nI am not yet so much changed cried Anne and stopped fearing she\\nhardly knew what misconstruction  After waiting a few moments\\nhe said and as if it were the result of immediate feeling\\nIt is a period indeed  Eight years and a half is a period\\n\\nWhether he would have proceeded farther was left to Annes imagination\\nto ponder over in a calmer hour for while still hearing the sounds\\nhe had uttered she was startled to other subjects by Henrietta\\neager to make use of the present leisure for getting out\\nand calling on her companions to lose no time lest somebody else\\nshould come in\\n\\nThey were obliged to move  Anne talked of being perfectly ready\\nand tried to look it but she felt that could Henrietta have known\\nthe regret and reluctance of her heart in quitting that chair\\nin preparing to quit the room she would have found in all her own\\nsensations for her cousin in the very security of his affection\\nwherewith to pity her\\n\\nTheir preparations however were stopped short  Alarming sounds\\nwere heard other visitors approached and the door was thrown open\\nfor Sir Walter and Miss Elliot whose entrance seemed to give\\na general chill  Anne felt an instant oppression and wherever she looked\\nsaw symptoms of the same  The comfort the freedom the gaiety\\nof the room was over hushed into cold composure determined silence\\nor insipid talk to meet the heartless elegance of her father and sister\\nHow mortifying to feel that it was so\\n\\nHer jealous eye was satisfied in one particular  Captain Wentworth\\nwas acknowledged again by each by Elizabeth more graciously than before\\nShe even addressed him once and looked at him more than once\\nElizabeth was in fact revolving a great measure  The sequel\\nexplained it  After the waste of a few minutes in saying\\nthe proper nothings she began to give the invitation which\\nwas to comprise all the remaining dues of the Musgroves\\nTomorrow evening to meet a few friends  no formal party\\nIt was all said very gracefully and the cards with which she had\\nprovided herself the Miss Elliot at home were laid on the table\\nwith a courteous comprehensive smile to all and one smile and\\none card more decidedly for Captain Wentworth  The truth was\\nthat Elizabeth had been long enough in Bath to understand\\nthe importance of a man of such an air and appearance as his\\nThe past was nothing  The present was that Captain Wentworth\\nwould move about well in her drawingroom  The card was pointedly given\\nand Sir Walter and Elizabeth arose and disappeared\\n\\nThe interruption had been short though severe and ease and animation\\nreturned to most of those they left as the door shut them out\\nbut not to Anne  She could think only of the invitation she had\\nwith such astonishment witnessed and of the manner in which\\nit had been received a manner of doubtful meaning of surprise rather\\nthan gratification of polite acknowledgement rather than acceptance\\nShe knew him she saw disdain in his eye and could not venture to believe\\nthat he had determined to accept such an offering as an atonement\\nfor all the insolence of the past  Her spirits sank  He held the card\\nin his hand after they were gone as if deeply considering it\\n\\nOnly think of Elizabeths including everybody whispered Mary\\nvery audibly  I do not wonder Captain Wentworth is delighted\\nYou see he cannot put the card out of his hand\\n\\nAnne caught his eye saw his cheeks glow and his mouth form itself\\ninto a momentary expression of contempt and turned away\\nthat she might neither see nor hear more to vex her\\n\\nThe party separated  The gentlemen had their own pursuits\\nthe ladies proceeded on their own business and they met no more while\\nAnne belonged to them  She was earnestly begged to return and dine\\nand give them all the rest of the day but her spirits had been\\nso long exerted that at present she felt unequal to more\\nand fit only for home where she might be sure of being as silent\\nas she chose\\n\\nPromising to be with them the whole of the following morning therefore\\nshe closed the fatigues of the present by a toilsome walk to Camden Place\\nthere to spend the evening chiefly in listening to the busy arrangements\\nof Elizabeth and Mrs Clay for the morrows party the frequent enumeration\\nof the persons invited and the continually improving detail of all\\nthe embellishments which were to make it the most completely elegant\\nof its kind in Bath while harassing herself with the neverending\\nquestion of whether Captain Wentworth would come or not  They were\\nreckoning him as certain but with her it was a gnawing solicitude\\nnever appeased for five minutes together  She generally thought\\nhe would come because she generally thought he ought but it was a case\\nwhich she could not so shape into any positive act of duty or discretion\\nas inevitably to defy the suggestions of very opposite feelings\\n\\nShe only roused herself from the broodings of this restless agitation\\nto let Mrs Clay know that she had been seen with Mr Elliot\\nthree hours after his being supposed to be out of Bath\\nfor having watched in vain for some intimation of the interview\\nfrom the lady herself she determined to mention it and it seemed to her\\nthere was guilt in Mrs Clays face as she listened  It was transient\\ncleared away in an instant but Anne could imagine she read there\\nthe consciousness of having by some complication of mutual trick\\nor some overbearing authority of his been obliged to attend\\nperhaps for half an hour to his lectures and restrictions on her designs\\non Sir Walter  She exclaimed however with a very tolerable\\nimitation of nature \\n\\nOh dear very true  Only think Miss Elliot to my great surprise\\nI met with Mr Elliot in Bath Street  I was never more astonished\\nHe turned back and walked with me to the Pump Yard  He had been prevented\\nsetting off for Thornberry but I really forget by what\\nfor I was in a hurry and could not much attend and I can only answer\\nfor his being determined not to be delayed in his return\\nHe wanted to know how early he might be admitted tomorrow\\nHe was full of tomorrow and it is very evident that I have been\\nfull of it too ever since I entered the house and learnt the extension\\nof your plan and all that had happened or my seeing him could never have\\ngone so entirely out of my head\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 23\\n\\n\\nOne day only had passed since Annes conversation with Mrs Smith\\nbut a keener interest had succeeded and she was now so little touched\\nby Mr Elliots conduct except by its effects in one quarter\\nthat it became a matter of course the next morning still to defer\\nher explanatory visit in Rivers Street  She had promised to be\\nwith the Musgroves from breakfast to dinner  Her faith was plighted\\nand Mr Elliots character like the Sultaness Scheherazades head\\nmust live another day\\n\\nShe could not keep her appointment punctually however\\nthe weather was unfavourable and she had grieved over the rain\\non her friends account and felt it very much on her own\\nbefore she was able to attempt the walk  When she reached the White Hart\\nand made her way to the proper apartment she found herself\\nneither arriving quite in time nor the first to arrive\\nThe party before her were Mrs Musgrove talking to Mrs Croft\\nand Captain Harville to Captain Wentworth and she immediately heard\\nthat Mary and Henrietta too impatient to wait had gone out the moment\\nit had cleared but would be back again soon and that the strictest\\ninjunctions had been left with Mrs Musgrove to keep her there\\ntill they returned  She had only to submit sit down\\nbe outwardly composed and feel herself plunged at once\\nin all the agitations which she had merely laid her account of\\ntasting a little before the morning closed  There was no delay\\nno waste of time  She was deep in the happiness of such misery\\nor the misery of such happiness instantly  Two minutes after\\nher entering the room Captain Wentworth said\\n\\nWe will write the letter we were talking of Harville now\\nif you will give me materials\\n\\nMaterials were at hand on a separate table he went to it\\nand nearly turning his back to them all was engrossed by writing\\n\\nMrs Musgrove was giving Mrs Croft the history of her eldest\\ndaughters engagement and just in that inconvenient tone of voice\\nwhich was perfectly audible while it pretended to be a whisper\\nAnne felt that she did not belong to the conversation and yet\\nas Captain Harville seemed thoughtful and not disposed to talk\\nshe could not avoid hearing many undesirable particulars such as\\nhow Mr Musgrove and my brother Hayter had met again and again\\nto talk it over what my brother Hayter had said one day\\nand what Mr Musgrove had proposed the next and what had occurred\\nto my sister Hayter and what the young people had wished and what\\nI said at first I never could consent to but was afterwards persuaded\\nto think might do very well and a great deal in the same style\\nof openhearted communication  minutiae which even with every advantage\\nof taste and delicacy which good Mrs Musgrove could not give\\ncould be properly interesting only to the principals  Mrs Croft\\nwas attending with great goodhumour and whenever she spoke at all\\nit was very sensibly  Anne hoped the gentlemen might each be\\ntoo much selfoccupied to hear\\n\\nAnd so maam all these thing considered said Mrs Musgrove\\nin her powerful whisper though we could have wished it different\\nyet altogether we did not think it fair to stand out any longer\\nfor Charles Hayter was quite wild about it and Henrietta was\\npretty near as bad and so we thought they had better marry at once\\nand make the best of it as many others have done before them\\nAt any rate said I it will be better than a long engagement\\n\\nThat is precisely what I was going to observe cried Mrs Croft\\nI would rather have young people settle on a small income at once\\nand have to struggle with a few difficulties together than be\\ninvolved in a long engagement  I always think that no mutual\\n\\nOh dear Mrs Croft cried Mrs Musgrove unable to let her\\nfinish her speech there is nothing I so abominate for young people\\nas a long engagement  It is what I always protested against\\nfor my children  It is all very well I used to say for young people\\nto be engaged if there is a certainty of their being able to marry\\nin six months or even in twelve but a long engagement\\n\\nYes dear maam said Mrs Croft or an uncertain engagement\\nan engagement which may be long  To begin without knowing\\nthat at such a time there will be the means of marrying\\nI hold to be very unsafe and unwise and what I think all parents\\nshould prevent as far as they can\\n\\nAnne found an unexpected interest here  She felt its application\\nto herself felt it in a nervous thrill all over her and at the same\\nmoment that her eyes instinctively glanced towards the distant table\\nCaptain Wentworths pen ceased to move his head was raised pausing\\nlistening and he turned round the next instant to give a look\\none quick conscious look at her\\n\\nThe two ladies continued to talk to reurge the same admitted truths\\nand enforce them with such examples of the ill effect of\\na contrary practice as had fallen within their observation\\nbut Anne heard nothing distinctly it was only a buzz of words in her ear\\nher mind was in confusion\\n\\nCaptain Harville who had in truth been hearing none of it\\nnow left his seat and moved to a window and Anne seeming to watch him\\nthough it was from thorough absence of mind became gradually sensible\\nthat he was inviting her to join him where he stood  He looked at her\\nwith a smile and a little motion of the head which expressed\\nCome to me I have something to say and the unaffected\\neasy kindness of manner which denoted the feelings of an older acquaintance\\nthan he really was strongly enforced the invitation  She roused herself\\nand went to him  The window at which he stood was at the other end\\nof the room from where the two ladies were sitting and though nearer\\nto Captain Wentworths table not very near  As she joined him\\nCaptain Harvilles countenance reassumed the serious thoughtful\\nexpression which seemed its natural character\\n\\nLook here said he unfolding a parcel in his hand and displaying\\na small miniature painting do you know who that is\\n\\nCertainly  Captain Benwick\\n\\nYes and you may guess who it is for  But in a deep tone\\nit was not done for her  Miss Elliot do you remember our\\nwalking together at Lyme and grieving for him  I little thought then\\nbut no matter  This was drawn at the Cape  He met with\\na clever young German artist at the Cape and in compliance with a promise\\nto my poor sister sat to him and was bringing it home for her\\nand I have now the charge of getting it properly set for another\\nIt was a commission to me  But who else was there to employ\\nI hope I can allow for him  I am not sorry indeed to make it\\nover to another  He undertakes it looking towards Captain Wentworth\\nhe is writing about it now  And with a quivering lip he wound up\\nthe whole by adding Poor Fanny she would not have forgotten him so soon\\n\\nNo replied Anne in a low feeling voice That I can easily believe\\n\\nIt was not in her nature  She doted on him\\n\\nIt would not be the nature of any woman who truly loved\\n\\nCaptain Harville smiled as much as to say Do you claim that\\nfor your sex and she answered the question smiling also\\nYes  We certainly do not forget you as soon as you forget us\\nIt is perhaps our fate rather than our merit  We cannot help ourselves\\nWe live at home quiet confined and our feelings prey upon us\\nYou are forced on exertion  You have always a profession pursuits\\nbusiness of some sort or other to take you back into the world immediately\\nand continual occupation and change soon weaken impressions\\n\\nGranting your assertion that the world does all this so soon for men\\nwhich however I do not think I shall grant it does not apply\\nto Benwick  He has not been forced upon any exertion  The peace\\nturned him on shore at the very moment and he has been living with us\\nin our little family circle ever since\\n\\nTrue said Anne very true I did not recollect but what shall\\nwe say now Captain Harville  If the change be not from\\noutward circumstances it must be from within it must be nature\\nmans nature which has done the business for Captain Benwick\\n\\nNo no it is not mans nature  I will not allow it to be more\\nmans nature than womans to be inconstant and forget those they do love\\nor have loved  I believe the reverse  I believe in a true analogy\\nbetween our bodily frames and our mental and that as our bodies are\\nthe strongest so are our feelings capable of bearing most rough usage\\nand riding out the heaviest weather\\n\\nYour feelings may be the strongest replied Anne but the same spirit\\nof analogy will authorise me to assert that ours are the most tender\\nMan is more robust than woman but he is not longer lived\\nwhich exactly explains my view of the nature of their attachments\\nNay it would be too hard upon you if it were otherwise\\nYou have difficulties and privations and dangers enough to struggle with\\nYou are always labouring and toiling exposed to every risk and hardship\\nYour home country friends all quitted  Neither time nor health\\nnor life to be called your own  It would be hard indeed\\nwith a faltering voice if womans feelings were to be\\nadded to all this\\n\\nWe shall never agree upon this question Captain Harville\\nwas beginning to say when a slight noise called their attention\\nto Captain Wentworths hitherto perfectly quiet division of the room\\nIt was nothing more than that his pen had fallen down but Anne was\\nstartled at finding him nearer than she had supposed and half inclined\\nto suspect that the pen had only fallen because he had been\\noccupied by them striving to catch sounds which yet she did not think\\nhe could have caught\\n\\nHave you finished your letter said Captain Harville\\n\\nNot quite a few lines more  I shall have done in five minutes\\n\\nThere is no hurry on my side  I am only ready whenever you are\\nI am in very good anchorage here smiling at Anne well supplied\\nand want for nothing  No hurry for a signal at all  Well Miss Elliot\\nlowering his voice as I was saying we shall never agree\\nI suppose upon this point  No man and woman would probably\\nBut let me observe that all histories are against youall stories\\nprose and verse  If I had such a memory as Benwick I could bring you\\nfifty quotations in a moment on my side the argument and I do not think\\nI ever opened a book in my life which had not something to say\\nupon womans inconstancy  Songs and proverbs all talk\\nof womans fickleness  But perhaps you will say these were all\\nwritten by men\\n\\nPerhaps I shall  Yes yes if you please no reference to examples\\nin books  Men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story\\nEducation has been theirs in so much higher a degree the pen has\\nbeen in their hands  I will not allow books to prove anything\\n\\nBut how shall we prove anything\\n\\nWe never shall  We never can expect to prove any thing upon such a point\\nIt is a difference of opinion which does not admit of proof\\nWe each begin probably with a little bias towards our own sex\\nand upon that bias build every circumstance in favour of it\\nwhich has occurred within our own circle many of which circumstances\\nperhaps those very cases which strike us the most may be precisely such\\nas cannot be brought forward without betraying a confidence\\nor in some respect saying what should not be said\\n\\nAh cried Captain Harville in a tone of strong feeling\\nif I could but make you comprehend what a man suffers when he takes\\na last look at his wife and children and watches the boat\\nthat he has sent them off in as long as it is in sight\\nand then turns away and says God knows whether we ever meet again\\nAnd then if I could convey to you the glow of his soul when he does\\nsee them again when coming back after a twelvemonths absence\\nperhaps and obliged to put into another port he calculates how soon\\nit be possible to get them there pretending to deceive himself\\nand saying They cannot be here till such a day but all the while\\nhoping for them twelve hours sooner and seeing them arrive at last\\nas if Heaven had given them wings by many hours sooner still\\nIf I could explain to you all this and all that a man can bear and do\\nand glories to do for the sake of these treasures of his existence\\nI speak you know only of such men as have hearts pressing his own\\nwith emotion\\n\\nOh cried Anne eagerly I hope I do justice to all that is felt by you\\nand by those who resemble you  God forbid that I should undervalue\\nthe warm and faithful feelings of any of my fellowcreatures\\nI should deserve utter contempt if I dared to suppose that true attachment\\nand constancy were known only by woman  No I believe you capable\\nof everything great and good in your married lives  I believe you equal\\nto every important exertion and to every domestic forbearance\\nso long asif I may be allowed the expressionso long as you have\\nan object  I mean while the woman you love lives and lives for you\\nAll the privilege I claim for my own sex it is not a very enviable one\\nyou need not covet it is that of loving longest when existence\\nor when hope is gone\\n\\nShe could not immediately have uttered another sentence her heart\\nwas too full her breath too much oppressed\\n\\nYou are a good soul cried Captain Harville putting his hand\\non her arm quite affectionately  There is no quarrelling with you\\nAnd when I think of Benwick my tongue is tied\\n\\nTheir attention was called towards the others  Mrs Croft was taking leave\\n\\nHere Frederick you and I part company I believe said she\\nI am going home and you have an engagement with your friend\\nTonight we may have the pleasure of all meeting again at your party\\nturning to Anne  We had your sisters card yesterday\\nand I understood Frederick had a card too though I did not see it\\nand you are disengaged Frederick are you not as well as ourselves\\n\\nCaptain Wentworth was folding up a letter in great haste and either\\ncould not or would not answer fully\\n\\nYes said he very true here we separate but Harville and I\\nshall soon be after you that is Harville if you are ready\\nI am in half a minute  I know you will not be sorry to be off\\nI shall be at your service in half a minute\\n\\nMrs Croft left them and Captain Wentworth having sealed his letter\\nwith great rapidity was indeed ready and had even a hurried\\nagitated air which shewed impatience to be gone  Anne knew not how\\nto understand it  She had the kindest Good morning God bless you\\nfrom Captain Harville but from him not a word nor a look\\nHe had passed out of the room without a look\\n\\nShe had only time however to move closer to the table where\\nhe had been writing when footsteps were heard returning\\nthe door opened it was himself  He begged their pardon\\nbut he had forgotten his gloves and instantly crossing the room\\nto the writing table he drew out a letter from under the scattered paper\\nplaced it before Anne with eyes of glowing entreaty fixed on her\\nfor a time and hastily collecting his gloves was again out of the room\\nalmost before Mrs Musgrove was aware of his being in it\\nthe work of an instant\\n\\nThe revolution which one instant had made in Anne was almost\\nbeyond expression  The letter with a direction hardly legible\\nto Miss A E was evidently the one which he had been folding\\nso hastily  While supposed to be writing only to Captain Benwick\\nhe had been also addressing her  On the contents of that letter\\ndepended all which this world could do for her  Anything was possible\\nanything might be defied rather than suspense  Mrs Musgrove had\\nlittle arrangements of her own at her own table to their protection\\nshe must trust and sinking into the chair which he had occupied\\nsucceeding to the very spot where he had leaned and written\\nher eyes devoured the following words\\n\\n\\nI can listen no longer in silence  I must speak to you by such means\\nas are within my reach  You pierce my soul  I am half agony\\nhalf hope  Tell me not that I am too late that such precious feelings\\nare gone for ever  I offer myself to you again with a heart\\neven more your own than when you almost broke it eight years\\nand a half ago  Dare not say that man forgets sooner than  woman\\nthat his love has an earlier death  I have loved none but you\\nUnjust I may have been weak and resentful I have been\\nbut never inconstant  You alone have brought me to Bath\\nFor you alone I think and plan  Have you not seen this\\nCan you fail to have understood my wishes  I had not waited even\\nthese ten days could I have read your feelings as I think you must have\\npenetrated mine  I can hardly write  I am every instant hearing\\nsomething which overpowers me  You sink your voice but I can\\ndistinguish the tones of that voice when they would be lost on others\\nToo good too excellent creature  You do us justice indeed\\nYou do believe that there is true attachment and constancy among men\\nBelieve it to be most fervent most undeviating in F W\\n\\nI must go uncertain of my fate but I shall return hither\\nor follow your party as soon as possible  A word a look\\nwill be enough to decide whether I enter your fathers house\\nthis evening or never\\n\\n\\nSuch a letter was not to be soon recovered from  Half and hours solitude\\nand reflection might have tranquillized her but the ten minutes only\\nwhich now passed before she was interrupted with all the restraints\\nof her situation could do nothing towards tranquillity  Every moment\\nrather brought fresh agitation  It was overpowering happiness\\nAnd before she was beyond the first stage of full sensation\\nCharles Mary and Henrietta all came in\\n\\nThe absolute necessity of seeming like herself produced then\\nan immediate struggle but after a while she could do no more\\nShe began not to understand a word they said and was obliged\\nto plead indisposition and excuse herself  They could then see\\nthat she looked very ill were shocked and concerned and would not\\nstir without her for the world  This was dreadful  Would they only\\nhave gone away and left her in the quiet possession of that room\\nit would have been her cure but to have them all standing or\\nwaiting around her was distracting and in desperation\\nshe said she would go home\\n\\nBy all means my dear cried Mrs Musgrove go home directly\\nand take care of yourself that you may be fit for the evening\\nI wish Sarah was here to doctor you but I am no doctor myself\\nCharles ring and order a chair  She must not walk\\n\\nBut the chair would never do  Worse than all  To lose the possibility\\nof speaking two words to Captain Wentworth in the course of her quiet\\nsolitary progress up the town and she felt almost certain of meeting him\\ncould not be borne  The chair was earnestly protested against\\nand Mrs Musgrove who thought only of one sort of illness\\nhaving assured herself with some anxiety that there had been no fall\\nin the case that Anne had not at any time lately slipped down\\nand got a blow on her head that she was perfectly convinced of having\\nhad no fall could part with her cheerfully and depend on\\nfinding her better at night\\n\\nAnxious to omit no possible precaution Anne struggled and said\\n\\nI am afraid maam that it is not perfectly understood\\nPray be so good as to mention to the other gentlemen that we hope\\nto see your whole party this evening  I am afraid there had been\\nsome mistake and I wish you particularly to assure Captain Harville\\nand Captain Wentworth that we hope to see them both\\n\\nOh my dear it is quite understood I give you my word\\nCaptain Harville has no thought but of going\\n\\nDo you think so  But I am afraid and I should be so very sorry\\nWill you promise me to mention it when you see them again\\nYou will see them both this morning I dare say  Do promise me\\n\\nTo be sure I will if you wish it  Charles if you see Captain Harville\\nanywhere remember to give Miss Annes message  But indeed my dear\\nyou need not be uneasy  Captain Harville holds himself quite engaged\\nIll answer for it and Captain Wentworth the same I dare say\\n\\nAnne could do no more but her heart prophesied some mischance\\nto damp the perfection of her felicity  It could not be very lasting\\nhowever  Even if he did not come to Camden Place himself\\nit would be in her power to send an intelligible sentence\\nby Captain Harville  Another momentary vexation occurred\\nCharles in his real concern and good nature would go home with her\\nthere was no preventing him  This was almost cruel  But she could not\\nbe long ungrateful he was sacrificing an engagement at a gunsmiths\\nto be of use to her and she set off with him with no feeling\\nbut gratitude apparent\\n\\nThey were on Union Street when a quicker step behind a something\\nof familiar sound gave her two moments preparation for the sight\\nof Captain Wentworth  He joined them but as if irresolute\\nwhether to join or to pass on said nothing only looked\\nAnne could command herself enough to receive that look\\nand not repulsively  The cheeks which had been pale now glowed\\nand the movements which had hesitated were decided  He walked by her side\\nPresently struck by a sudden thought Charles said\\n\\nCaptain Wentworth which way are you going  Only to Gay Street\\nor farther up the town\\n\\nI hardly know replied Captain Wentworth surprised\\n\\nAre you going as high as Belmont  Are you going near Camden Place\\nBecause if you are I shall have no scruple in asking you\\nto take my place and give Anne your arm to her fathers door\\nShe is rather done for this morning and must not go so far without help\\nand I ought to be at that fellows in the Market Place\\nHe promised me the sight of a capital gun he is just going to send off\\nsaid he would keep it unpacked to the last possible moment\\nthat I might see it and if I do not turn back now I have no chance\\nBy his description a good deal like the second size doublebarrel of mine\\nwhich you shot with one day round Winthrop\\n\\nThere could not be an objection  There could be only the most\\nproper alacrity a most obliging compliance for public view\\nand smiles reined in and spirits dancing in private rapture\\nIn half a minute Charles was at the bottom of Union Street again\\nand the other two proceeding together  and soon words enough had passed\\nbetween them to decide their direction towards the comparatively quiet\\nand retired gravel walk where the power of conversation would make\\nthe present hour a blessing indeed and prepare it for all\\nthe immortality which the happiest recollections of their own future lives\\ncould bestow  There they exchanged again those feelings\\nand those promises which had once before seemed to secure everything\\nbut which had been followed by so many many years of division\\nand estrangement  There they returned again into the past\\nmore exquisitely happy perhaps in their reunion than when\\nit had been first projected more tender more tried more fixed\\nin a knowledge of each others character truth and attachment\\nmore equal to act more justified in acting  And there as they slowly\\npaced the gradual ascent heedless of every group around them\\nseeing neither sauntering politicians bustling housekeepers\\nflirting girls nor nurserymaids and children they could indulge in\\nthose retrospections and acknowledgements and especially in\\nthose explanations of what had directly preceded the present moment\\nwhich were so poignant and so ceaseless in interest  All the little\\nvariations of the last week were gone through and of yesterday\\nand today there could scarcely be an end\\n\\nShe had not mistaken him  Jealousy of Mr Elliot had been\\nthe retarding weight the doubt the torment  That had begun to operate\\nin the very hour of first meeting her in Bath that had returned\\nafter a short suspension to ruin the concert and that had influenced him\\nin everything he had said and done or omitted to say and do\\nin the last fourandtwenty hours  It had been gradually yielding\\nto the better hopes which her looks or words or actions\\noccasionally encouraged it had been vanquished at last by\\nthose sentiments and those tones which had reached him while she talked\\nwith Captain Harville and under the irresistible governance of which\\nhe had seized a sheet of paper and poured out his feelings\\n\\nOf what he had then written nothing was to be retracted or qualified\\nHe persisted in having loved none but her  She had never been supplanted\\nHe never even believed himself to see her equal  Thus much indeed\\nhe was obliged to acknowledge  that he had been constant unconsciously\\nnay unintentionally that he had meant to forget her and believed it\\nto be done  He had imagined himself indifferent when he had only\\nbeen angry and he had been unjust to her merits because he had been\\na sufferer from them  Her character was now fixed on his mind\\nas perfection itself maintaining the loveliest medium of fortitude\\nand gentleness but he was obliged to acknowledge that only at Uppercross\\nhad he learnt to do her justice and only at Lyme had he begun\\nto understand himself  At Lyme he had received lessons\\nof more than one sort  The passing admiration of Mr Elliot\\nhad at least roused him and the scenes on the Cobb and at\\nCaptain Harvilles had fixed her superiority\\n\\nIn his preceding attempts to attach himself to Louisa Musgrove\\nthe attempts of angry pride he protested that he had for ever\\nfelt it to be impossible that he had not cared could not care\\nfor Louisa though till that day till the leisure for reflection\\nwhich followed it he had not understood the perfect excellence\\nof the mind with which Louisas could so ill bear a comparison\\nor the perfect unrivalled hold it possessed over his own\\nThere he had learnt to distinguish between the steadiness of principle\\nand the obstinacy of selfwill between the darings of heedlessness\\nand the resolution of a collected mind  There he had seen everything\\nto exalt in his estimation the woman he had lost and there begun\\nto deplore the pride the folly the madness of resentment\\nwhich had kept him from trying to regain her when thrown in his way\\n\\nFrom that period his penance had become severe  He had no sooner\\nbeen free from the horror and remorse attending the first few days\\nof Louisas accident no sooner begun to feel himself alive again\\nthan he had begun to feel himself though alive not at liberty\\n\\nI found said he that I was considered by Harville an engaged man\\nThat neither Harville nor his wife entertained a doubt of our\\nmutual attachment  I was startled and shocked  To a degree\\nI could contradict this instantly but when I began to reflect\\nthat others might have felt the sameher own family nay\\nperhaps herselfI was no longer at my own disposal  I was hers in honour\\nif she wished it  I had been unguarded  I had not thought seriously\\non this subject before  I had not considered that my excessive intimacy\\nmust have its danger of ill consequence in many ways and that I had\\nno right to be trying whether I could attach myself to either of the girls\\nat the risk of raising even an unpleasant report were there no other\\nill effects  I had been grossly wrong and must abide the consequences\\n\\nHe found too late in short that he had entangled himself\\nand that precisely as he became fully satisfied of his not caring\\nfor Louisa at all he must regard himself as bound to her\\nif her sentiments for him were what the Harvilles supposed\\nIt determined him to leave Lyme and await her complete recovery elsewhere\\nHe would gladly weaken by any fair means whatever feelings or\\nspeculations concerning him might exist and he went therefore\\nto his brothers meaning after a while to return to Kellynch\\nand act as circumstances might require\\n\\nI was six weeks with Edward said he and saw him happy\\nI could have no other pleasure  I deserved none  He enquired after you\\nvery particularly asked even if you were personally altered\\nlittle suspecting that to my eye you could never alter\\n\\nAnne smiled and let it pass  It was too pleasing a blunder\\nfor a reproach  It is something for a woman to be assured\\nin her eightandtwentieth year that she has not lost one charm\\nof earlier youth but the value of such homage was inexpressibly increased\\nto Anne by comparing it with former words and feeling it to be\\nthe result not the cause of a revival of his warm attachment\\n\\nHe had remained in Shropshire lamenting the blindness of his own pride\\nand the blunders of his own calculations till at once released from Louisa\\nby the astonishing and felicitous intelligence of her engagement\\nwith Benwick\\n\\nHere said he ended the worst of my state for now I could at least\\nput myself in the way of happiness I could exert myself\\nI could do something  But to be waiting so long in inaction\\nand waiting only for evil had been dreadful  Within the first\\nfive minutes I said I will be at Bath on Wednesday and I was\\nWas it unpardonable to think it worth my while to come and to arrive\\nwith some degree of hope  You were single  It was possible that\\nyou might retain the feelings of the past as I did and one encouragement\\nhappened to be mine  I could never doubt that you would be loved and\\nsought by others but I knew to a certainty that you had refused one man\\nat least of better pretensions than myself and I could not help\\noften saying Was this for me\\n\\nTheir first meeting in Milsom Street afforded much to be said\\nbut the concert still more  That evening seemed to be made up\\nof exquisite moments  The moment of her stepping forward\\nin the Octagon Room to speak to him  the moment of Mr Elliots appearing\\nand tearing her away and one or two subsequent moments\\nmarked by returning hope or increasing despondency were dwelt on\\nwith energy\\n\\nTo see you cried he in the midst of those who could not be\\nmy wellwishers to see your cousin close by you conversing and smiling\\nand feel all the horrible eligibilities and proprieties of the match\\nTo consider it as the certain wish of every being who could hope\\nto influence you  Even if your own feelings were reluctant or indifferent\\nto consider what powerful supports would be his  Was it not enough\\nto make the fool of me which I appeared  How could I look on\\nwithout agony  Was not the very sight of the friend who sat behind you\\nwas not the recollection of what had been the knowledge of her influence\\nthe indelible immoveable impression of what persuasion had once done\\nwas it not all against me\\n\\nYou should have distinguished replied Anne  You should not have\\nsuspected me now the case is so different and my age is so different\\nIf I was wrong in yielding to persuasion once remember that\\nit was to persuasion exerted on the side of safety not of risk\\nWhen I yielded I thought it was to duty but no duty could be called\\nin aid here  In marrying a man indifferent to me all risk\\nwould have been incurred and all duty violated\\n\\nPerhaps I ought to have reasoned thus he replied but I could not\\nI could not derive benefit from the late knowledge I had acquired\\nof your character  I could not bring it into play it was overwhelmed\\nburied lost in those earlier feelings which I had been smarting under\\nyear after year  I could think of you only as one who had yielded\\nwho had given me up who had been influenced by any one rather than by me\\nI saw you with the very person who had guided you in that year of misery\\nI had no reason to believe her of less authority now  The force of habit\\nwas to be added\\n\\nI should have thought said Anne that my manner to yourself\\nmight have spared you much or all of this\\n\\nNo no your manner might be only the ease which your engagement\\nto another man would give  I left you in this belief and yet\\nI was determined to see you again  My spirits rallied with the morning\\nand I felt that I had still a motive for remaining here\\n\\nAt last Anne was at home again and happier than any one in that house\\ncould have conceived  All the surprise and suspense and every other\\npainful part of the morning dissipated by this conversation\\nshe reentered the house so happy as to be obliged to find an alloy\\nin some momentary apprehensions of its being impossible to last\\nAn interval of meditation serious and grateful was the best corrective\\nof everything dangerous in such highwrought felicity and she went\\nto her room and grew steadfast and fearless in the thankfulness\\nof her enjoyment\\n\\nThe evening came the drawingrooms were lighted up the company assembled\\nIt was but a card party it was but a mixture of those who had\\nnever met before and those who met too often a commonplace business\\ntoo numerous for intimacy too small for variety but Anne had never found\\nan evening shorter  Glowing and lovely in sensibility and happiness\\nand more generally admired than she thought about or cared for\\nshe had cheerful or forbearing feelings for every creature around her\\nMr Elliot was there she avoided but she could pity him\\nThe Wallises she had amusement in understanding them  Lady Dalrymple\\nand Miss Carteretthey would soon be innoxious cousins to her\\nShe cared not for Mrs Clay and had nothing to blush for in\\nthe public manners of her father and sister  With the Musgroves\\nthere was the happy chat of perfect ease with Captain Harville\\nthe kindhearted intercourse of brother and sister with Lady Russell\\nattempts at conversation which a delicious consciousness cut short\\nwith Admiral and Mrs Croft everything of peculiar cordiality and\\nfervent interest which the same consciousness sought to conceal\\nand with Captain Wentworth some moments of communications\\ncontinually occurring and always the hope of more and always\\nthe knowledge of his being there\\n\\nIt was in one of these short meetings each apparently occupied\\nin admiring a fine display of greenhouse plants that she said\\n\\nI have been thinking over the past and trying impartially\\nto judge of the right and wrong I mean with regard to myself\\nand I must believe that I was right much as I suffered from it\\nthat I was perfectly right in being guided by the friend whom\\nyou will love better than you do now  To me she was in the place\\nof a parent  Do not mistake me however  I am not saying\\nthat she did not err in her advice  It was perhaps one of those cases\\nin which advice is good or bad only as the event decides\\nand for myself I certainly never should in any circumstance\\nof tolerable similarity give such advice  But I mean that I was right\\nin submitting to her and that if I had done otherwise I should have\\nsuffered more in continuing the engagement than I did even in giving it up\\nbecause I should have suffered in my conscience  I have now\\nas far as such a

and looking again at her\\nreplied as if in cool deliberation\\n\\nNot yet  But there are hopes of her being forgiven in time\\nI trust to being in charity with her soon  But I too have been\\nthinking over the past and a  question has suggested itself\\nwhether there may not have been one person more my enemy\\neven than that lady  My own self  Tell me if when I returned\\nto England in the year eight with a few thousand pounds\\nand was posted into the Laconia if I had then written to you\\nwould you have answered my letter  Would you in short\\nhave renewed the engagement then\\n\\nWould I was all her answer but the accent was decisive enough\\n\\nGood God he cried you would  It is not that I did not think of it\\nor desire it as what could alone crown all my other success\\nbut I was proud too proud to ask again  I did not understand you\\nI shut my eyes and would not understand you or do you justice\\nThis is a recollection which ought to make me forgive every one\\nsooner than myself  Six years of separation and suffering\\nmight have been spared  It is a sort of pain too which is new to me\\nI have been used to the gratification of believing myself to earn\\nevery blessing that I enjoyed  I have valued myself on honourable toils\\nand just rewards  Like other great men under reverses he added\\nwith a smile I must endeavour to subdue my mind to my fortune\\nI must learn to brook being happier than I deserve\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 24\\n\\n\\nWho can be in doubt of what followed  When any two young people\\ntake it into their heads to marry they are pretty sure by perseverance\\nto carry their point be they ever so poor or ever so imprudent\\nor ever so little likely to be necessary to each others ultimate comfort\\nThis may be bad morality to conclude with but I believe it to be truth\\nand if such parties succeed how should a Captain Wentworth and\\nan Anne Elliot with the advantage of maturity of mind\\nconsciousness of right and one independent fortune between them\\nfail of bearing down every opposition  They might in fact\\nhave borne down a great deal more than they met with for there was\\nlittle to distress them beyond the want of graciousness and warmth\\nSir Walter made no objection and Elizabeth did nothing worse\\nthan look cold and unconcerned  Captain Wentworth with fiveandtwenty\\nthousand pounds and as high in his profession as merit and activity\\ncould place him was no longer nobody  He was now esteemed quite worthy\\nto address the daughter of a foolish spendthrift baronet\\nwho had not had principle or sense enough to maintain himself\\nin the situation in which Providence had placed him and who could\\ngive his daughter at present but a small part of the share\\nof ten thousand pounds which must be hers hereafter\\n\\nSir Walter indeed though he had no affection for Anne\\nand no vanity flattered to make him really happy on the occasion\\nwas very far from thinking it a bad match for her  On the contrary\\nwhen he saw more of Captain Wentworth saw him repeatedly by daylight\\nand eyed him well he was very much struck by his personal claims\\nand felt that his superiority of appearance might be not unfairly balanced\\nagainst her superiority of rank and all this assisted by\\nhis wellsounding name enabled Sir Walter at last to prepare his pen\\nwith a very good grace for the insertion of the marriage\\nin the volume of honour\\n\\nThe only one among them whose opposition of feeling could excite\\nany serious anxiety was Lady Russell  Anne knew that Lady Russell\\nmust be suffering some pain in understanding and relinquishing Mr Elliot\\nand be making some struggles to become truly acquainted with\\nand do justice to Captain Wentworth  This however was what\\nLady Russell had now to do  She must learn to feel that she had\\nbeen mistaken with regard to both that she had been unfairly influenced\\nby appearances in each that because Captain Wentworths manners\\nhad not suited her own ideas she had been too quick in suspecting them\\nto indicate a character of dangerous impetuosity and that because\\nMr Elliots manners had precisely pleased her in their propriety\\nand correctness their general politeness and suavity she had been\\ntoo quick in receiving them as the certain result of the most correct\\nopinions and wellregulated mind  There was nothing less\\nfor Lady Russell to do than to admit that she had been\\npretty completely wrong and to take up a new set of opinions\\nand of hopes\\n\\nThere is a quickness of perception in some a nicety in the discernment\\nof character a natural penetration in short which no experience\\nin others can equal and Lady Russell had been less gifted\\nin this part of understanding than her young friend  But she was\\na very good woman and if her second object was to be sensible\\nand welljudging her first was to see Anne happy  She loved Anne\\nbetter than she loved her own abilities and when the awkwardness\\nof the beginning was over found little hardship in attaching herself\\nas a mother to the man who was securing the happiness of her other child\\n\\nOf all the family Mary was probably the one most immediately gratified\\nby the circumstance  It was creditable to have a sister married\\nand she might flatter herself with having been greatly instrumental\\nto the connexion by keeping Anne with her in the autumn\\nand as her own sister must be better than her husbands sisters\\nit was very agreeable that Captain Wentworth should be a richer man than\\neither Captain Benwick or Charles Hayter  She had something to suffer\\nperhaps when they came into contact again in seeing Anne restored\\nto the rights of seniority and the mistress of a very pretty landaulette\\nbut she had a future to look forward to of powerful consolation\\nAnne had no Uppercross Hall before her no landed estate\\nno headship of a family and if they could but keep Captain Wentworth\\nfrom being made a baronet she would not change situations with Anne\\n\\nIt would be well for the eldest sister if she were equally satisfied\\nwith her situation for a change is not very probable there\\nShe had soon the mortification of seeing Mr Elliot withdraw\\nand no one of proper condition has since presented himself to raise\\neven the unfounded hopes which sunk with him\\n\\nThe news of his cousins Annes engagement burst on Mr Elliot\\nmost unexpectedly  It deranged his best plan of domestic happiness\\nhis best hope of keeping Sir Walter single by the watchfulness\\nwhich a soninlaws rights would have given  But though discomfited\\nand disappointed he could still do something for his own interest\\nand his own enjoyment  He soon quitted Bath and on Mrs Clays\\nquitting it soon afterwards and being next heard of as established\\nunder his protection in London it was evident how double a game\\nhe had been playing and how determined he was to save himself\\nfrom being cut out by one artful woman at least\\n\\nMrs Clays affections had overpowered her interest and she had sacrificed\\nfor the young mans sake the possibility of scheming longer\\nfor Sir Walter  She has abilities however as well as affections\\nand it is now a doubtful point whether his cunning or hers\\nmay finally carry the day whether after preventing her from being\\nthe wife of Sir Walter he may not be wheedled and caressed at last\\ninto making her the wife of Sir William\\n\\nIt cannot be doubted that Sir Walter and Elizabeth were shocked\\nand mortified by the loss of their companion and the discovery of\\ntheir deception in her  They had their great cousins to be sure\\nto resort to for comfort but they must long feel that to flatter\\nand follow others without being flattered and followed in turn\\nis but a state of half enjoyment\\n\\nAnne satisfied at a very early period of Lady Russells meaning\\nto love Captain Wentworth as she ought had no other alloy\\nto the happiness of her prospects than what arose from the consciousness\\nof having no relations to bestow on him which a man of sense could value\\nThere she felt her own inferiority very keenly  The disproportion\\nin their fortune was nothing it did not give her a moments regret\\nbut to have no family to receive and estimate him properly\\nnothing of respectability of harmony of good will to offer\\nin return for all the worth and all the prompt welcome which met her\\nin his brothers and sisters was a source of as lively pain\\nas her mind could well be sensible of under circumstances of otherwise\\nstrong felicity  She had but two friends in the world to add to his list\\nLady Russell and Mrs Smith  To those however he was very well disposed\\nto attach himself  Lady Russell in spite of all her former transgressions\\nhe could now value from his heart  While he was not obliged to say\\nthat he believed her to have been right in originally dividing them\\nhe was ready to say almost everything else in her favour\\nand as for Mrs Smith she had claims of various kinds to recommend her\\nquickly and permanently\\n\\nHer recent good offices by Anne had been enough in themselves\\nand their marriage instead of depriving her of one friend\\nsecured her two  She was their earliest visitor in their settled life\\nand Captain Wentworth by putting her in the way of recovering\\nher husbands property in the West Indies by writing for her\\nacting for her and seeing her through all the petty difficulties\\nof the case with the activity and exertion of a fearless man\\nand a determined friend fully requited the services which\\nshe had rendered or ever meant to render to his wife\\n\\nMrs Smiths enjoyments were not spoiled by this improvement of income\\nwith some improvement of health and the acquisition of such friends\\nto be often with for her cheerfulness and mental alacrity did not\\nfail her and while these prime supplies of good remained she might have\\nbid defiance even to greater accessions of worldly prosperity\\nShe might have been absolutely rich and perfectly healthy\\nand yet be happy  Her spring of felicity was in the glow\\nof her spirits as her friend Annes was in the warmth of her heart\\nAnne was tenderness itself and she had the full worth of it\\nin Captain Wentworths affection  His profession was all that could ever\\nmake her friends wish that tenderness less the dread of a future war\\nall that could dim her sunshine  She gloried in being a sailors wife\\nbut she must pay the tax of quick alarm for belonging to that profession\\nwhich is if possible more distinguished in its domestic virtues\\nthan in its national importance\\n\\n\\n\\n        Finis\\n\\n\\n\\n'"

disposal;\\nfor the remaining moiety of his first wife\\'s fortune was\\nalso secured to her child, and he had only a life-interest\\nin it.\\n\\nthe old gentleman died: his will was read, and\\nlike almost every other will, gave as much disappointment\\nas pleasure.  he was neither so unjust, nor so ungrateful,\\nas to leave his estate from his nephew;--but he left it to him\\non such terms as destroyed half the value of the bequest.\\nmr. dashwood had wished for it more for the sake of his\\nwife and daughters than for himself or his son;--but to\\nhis son, and his son\\'s son, a child of four years old,\\nit was secured, in such a way, as to leave to himself\\nno power of providing for those who were most dear\\nto him, and who most needed a provision by any charge\\non the estate, or by any sale of its valuable woods.\\nthe whole was tied up for the benefit of this child, who,\\nin occasional visits with his father and mother at norland,\\nhad so far gained on the affections of his uncle,\\nby such attractions as are by no means unusual in children\\nof two or three years old; an imperfect articulation,\\nan earnest desire of having his own way, many cunning tricks,\\nand a great deal of noise, as to outweigh all the value\\nof all the attention which, for years, he had received\\nfrom his niece and her daughters.  he meant not to\\nbe unkind, however, and, as a mark of his affection\\nfor the three girls, he left them a thousand pounds a-piece.\\n\\nmr. dashwood\\'s disappointment was, at first, severe;\\nbut his temper was cheerful and sanguine; and he might\\nreasonably hope to live many years, and by living economically,\\nlay by a considerable sum from the produce of an estate\\nalready large, and capable of almost immediate improvement.\\nbut the fortune, which had been so tardy in coming, was his\\nonly one twelvemonth.  he survived his uncle no longer;\\nand ten thousand pounds, including the late legacies,\\nwas all that remained for his widow and daughters.\\n\\nhis son was sent for as soon as his danger was known,\\nand to him mr. dashwood recommended, with all the strength\\nand urgency which illness could command, the interest\\nof his mother-in-law and sisters.\\n\\nmr. john dashwood had not the strong feelings of the\\nrest of the family; but he was affected by a recommendation\\nof such a nature at such a time, and he promised to do\\nevery thing in his power to make them comfortable.\\nhis father was rendered easy by such an assurance,\\nand mr. john dashwood had then leisure to consider how\\nmuch there might prudently be in his power to do for them.\\n\\nhe was not an ill-disposed young man, unless to\\nbe rather cold hearted and rather selfish is to be\\nill-disposed: but he was, in general, well respected;\\nfor he conducted himself with propriety in the discharge\\nof his ordinary duties.  had he married a more amiable woman,\\nhe might have been made still more respectable than he\\nwas:--he might even have been made amiable himself; for he\\nwas very young when he married, and very fond of his wife.\\nbut mrs. john dashwood was a strong caricature of himself;--\\nmore narrow-minded and selfish.\\n\\nwhen he gave his promise to his father, he meditated\\nwithin himself to increase the fortunes of his sisters\\nby the present of a thousand pounds a-piece.  he then\\nreally thought himself equal to it.  the prospect of four\\nthousand a-year, in addition to his present income,\\nbesides the remaining half of his own mother\\'s fortune,\\nwarmed his heart, and made him feel capable of generosity.--\\n\"yes, he would give them three thousand pounds: it would\\nbe liberal and handsome! it would be enough to make\\nthem completely easy.  three thousand pounds! he could\\nspare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience.\"--\\nhe thought of it all day long, and for many days successively,\\nand he did not repent.\\n\\nno sooner was his father\\'s funeral over, than mrs. john\\ndashwood, without sending any notice of her intention to her\\nmother-in-law, arrived with her child and their attendants.\\nno one could dispute her right to come; the house was\\nher husband\\'s from the moment of his father\\'s decease;\\nbut the indelicacy of her conduct was so much the greater,\\nand to a woman in mrs. dashwood\\'s situation, with only\\ncommon feelings, must have been highly unpleasing;--\\nbut in her mind there was a sense of honor so keen,\\na generosity so romantic, that any offence of the kind,\\nby whomsoever given or received, was to her a source\\nof immoveable disgust.  mrs. john dashwood had never\\nbeen a favourite with any of her husband\\'s family;\\nbut she had had no opportunity, till the present,\\nof shewing them with how little attention to the comfort\\nof other people she could act when occasion required it.\\n\\nso acutely did mrs. dashwood feel this ungracious\\nbehaviour, and so earnestly did she despise her\\ndaughter-in-law for it, that, on the arrival of the latter,\\nshe would have quitted the house for ever, had not the\\nentreaty of her eldest girl induced her first to reflect\\non the propriety of going, and her own tender love for all\\nher three children determined her afterwards to stay,\\nand for their sakes avoid a breach with their brother.\\n\\nelinor, this eldest daughter, whose advice was\\nso effectual, possessed a strength of understanding,\\nand coolness of judgment, which qualified her,\\nthough only nineteen, to be the counsellor of her mother,\\nand enabled her frequently to counteract, to the advantage\\nof them all, that eagerness of mind in mrs. dashwood\\nwhich must generally have led to imprudence.  she had\\nan excellent heart;--her disposition was affectionate,\\nand her feelings were strong; but she knew how to govern\\nthem: it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn;\\nand which one of her sisters had resolved never to be taught.\\n\\nmarianne\\'s abilities were, in many respects,\\nquite equal to elinor\\'s. she was sensible and clever;\\nbut eager in everything: her sorrows, her joys, could have\\nno moderation.  she was generous, amiable, interesting: she\\nwas everything but prudent.  the resemblance between\\nher and her mother was strikingly great.\\n\\nelinor saw, with concern, the excess of her\\nsister\\'s sensibility; but by mrs. dashwood it was valued\\nand cherished.  they encouraged each other now in the\\nviolence of their affliction.  the agony of grief\\nwhich overpowered them at first, was voluntarily renewed,\\nwas sought for, was created again and again.  they gave\\nthemselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase\\nof wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it,\\nand resolved against ever admitting consolation\\nin future.  elinor, too, was deeply afflicted; but still\\nshe could struggle, she could exert herself.  she could\\nconsult with her brother, could receive her sister-in-law\\non her arrival, and treat her with proper attention;\\nand could strive to rouse her mother to similar exertion,\\nand encourage her to similar forbearance.\\n\\nmargaret, the other sister, was a good-humored,\\nwell-disposed girl; but as she had already imbibed\\na good deal of marianne\\'s romance, without having\\nmuch of her sense, she did not, at thirteen, bid fair\\nto equal her sisters at a more advanced period of life.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 2\\n\\n\\nmrs. john dashwood now installed herself mistress\\nof norland; and her mother and sisters-in-law were degraded\\nto the condition of visitors.  as such, however, they were\\ntreated by her with quiet civility; and by her husband\\nwith as much kindness as he could feel towards anybody\\nbeyond himself, his wife, and their child.  he really\\npressed them, with some earnestness, to consider norland\\nas their home; and, as no plan appeared so eligible\\nto mrs. dashwood as remaining there till she could\\naccommodate herself with a house in the neighbourhood,\\nhis invitation was accepted.\\n\\na continuance in a place where everything reminded\\nher of former delight, was exactly what suited her mind.\\nin seasons of cheerfulness, no temper could be more cheerful\\nthan hers, or possess, in a greater degree, that sanguine\\nexpectation of happiness which is happiness itself.\\nbut in sorrow she must be equally carried away by her fancy,\\nand as far beyond consolation as in pleasure she was\\nbeyond alloy.\\n\\nmrs. john dashwood did not at all approve of what her\\nhusband intended to do for his sisters.  to take three\\nthousand pounds from the fortune of their dear little boy\\nwould be impoverishing him to the most dreadful degree.\\nshe begged him to think again on the subject.  how could\\nhe answer it to himself to rob his child, and his only\\nchild too, of so large a sum?  and what possible claim\\ncould the miss dashwoods, who were related to him only by\\nhalf blood, which she considered as no relationship at all,\\nhave on his generosity to so large an amount.  it was very\\nwell known that no affection was ever supposed to exist\\nbetween the children of any man by different marriages;\\nand why was he to ruin himself, and their poor little harry,\\nby giving away all his money to his half sisters?\\n\\n\"it was my father\\'s last request to me,\" replied\\nher husband, \"that i should assist his widow and daughters.\"\\n\\n\"he did not know what he was talking of, i dare say;\\nten to one but he was light-headed at the time.\\nhad he been in his right senses, he could not have thought\\nof such a thing as begging you to give away half your\\nfortune from your own child.\"\\n\\n\"he did not stipulate for any particular sum,\\nmy dear fanny; he only requested me, in general terms,\\nto assist them, and make their situation more comfortable\\nthan it was in his power to do.  perhaps it would\\nhave been as well if he had left it wholly to myself.\\nhe could hardly suppose i should neglect them.\\nbut as he required the promise, i could not do less\\nthan give it; at least i thought so at the time.\\nthe promise, therefore, was given, and must be performed.\\nsomething must be done for them whenever they leave norland\\nand settle in a new home.\"\\n\\n\"well, then, let something be done for them;\\nbut that something need not be three thousand pounds.\\nconsider,\" she added, \"that when the money is once\\nparted with, it never can return.  your sisters will marry,\\nand it will be gone for ever.  if, indeed, it could\\nbe restored to our poor little boy--\"\\n\\n\"why, to be sure,\" said her husband, very gravely,\\n\"that would make great difference.  the time may come when\\nharry will regret that so large a sum was parted with.\\nif he should have a numerous family, for instance, it would\\nbe a very convenient addition.\"\\n\\n\"to be sure it would.\"\\n\\n\"perhaps, then, it would be better for all parties,\\nif the sum were diminished one half.--five hundred pounds\\nwould be a prodigious increase to their fortunes!\"\\n\\n\"oh! beyond anything great!  what brother on earth\\nwould do half so much for his sisters, even if really\\nhis sisters!  and as it is--only half blood!--but you\\nhave such a generous spirit!\"\\n\\n\"i would not wish to do any thing mean,\" he replied.\\n\"one had rather, on such occasions, do too much than\\ntoo little.  no one, at least, can think i have not\\ndone enough for them: even themselves, they can hardly\\nexpect more.\"\\n\\n\"there is no knowing what they may expect,\"\\nsaid the lady, \"but we are not to think of their\\nexpectations: the question is, what you can afford to do.\"\\n\\n\"certainly--and i think i may afford to give them five\\nhundred pounds a-piece.  as it is, without any addition\\nof mine, they will each have about three thousand pounds\\non their mother\\'s death--a very comfortable fortune\\nfor any young woman.\"\\n\\n\"to be sure it is; and, indeed, it strikes me that\\nthey can want no addition at all.  they will have ten\\nthousand pounds divided amongst them.  if they marry,\\nthey will be sure of doing well, and if they do not,\\nthey may all live very comfortably together on the interest\\nof ten thousand pounds.\"\\n\\n\"that is very true, and, therefore, i do not know whether,\\nupon the whole, it would not be more advisable to do\\nsomething for their mother while she lives, rather than\\nfor them--something of the annuity kind i mean.--my sisters\\nwould feel the good effects of it as well as herself.\\na hundred a year would make them all perfectly comfortable.\"\\n\\nhis wife hesitated a little, however, in giving\\nher consent to this plan.\\n\\n\"to be sure,\" said she, \"it is better than parting with\\nfifteen hundred pounds at once.  but, then, if mrs. dashwood\\nshould live fifteen years we shall be completely taken in.\"\\n\\n\"fifteen years! my dear fanny; her life cannot\\nbe worth half that purchase.\"\\n\\n\"certainly not; but if you observe, people always\\nlive for ever when there is an annuity to be paid them;\\nand she is very stout and healthy, and hardly forty.\\nan annuity is a very serious business; it comes over\\nand over every year, and there is no getting rid\\nof it.  you are not aware of what you are doing.\\ni have known a great deal of the trouble of annuities;\\nfor my mother was clogged with the payment of three\\nto old superannuated servants by my father\\'s will,\\nand it is amazing how disagreeable she found it.\\ntwice every year these annuities were to be paid; and then\\nthere was the trouble of getting it to them; and then one\\nof them was said to have died, and afterwards it turned\\nout to be no such thing.  my mother was quite sick of it.\\nher income was not her own, she said, with such perpetual\\nclaims on it; and it was the more unkind in my father,\\nbecause, otherwise, the money would have been entirely at\\nmy mother\\'s disposal, without any restriction whatever.\\nit has given me such an abhorrence of annuities, that i am\\nsure i would not pin myself down to the payment of one for\\nall the world.\"\\n\\n\"it is certainly an unpleasant thing,\" replied mr. dashwood,\\n\"to have those kind of yearly drains on one\\'s income.\\none\\'s fortune, as your mother justly says, is not one\\'s own.\\nto be tied down to the regular payment of such a sum,\\non every rent day, is by no means desirable: it takes away\\none\\'s independence.\"\\n\\n\"undoubtedly; and after all you have no thanks for it.\\nthey think themselves secure, you do no more than what\\nis expected, and it raises no gratitude at all.  if i were you,\\nwhatever i did should be done at my own discretion entirely.\\ni would not bind myself to allow them any thing yearly.\\nit may be very inconvenient some years to spare a hundred,\\nor even fifty pounds from our own expenses.\"\\n\\n\"i believe you are right, my love; it will be better\\nthat there should by no annuity in the case; whatever i\\nmay give them occasionally will be of far greater assistance\\nthan a yearly allowance, because they would only enlarge\\ntheir style of living if they felt sure of a larger income,\\nand would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end\\nof the year.  it will certainly be much the best way.\\na present of fifty pounds, now and then, will prevent\\ntheir ever being distressed for money, and will, i think,\\nbe amply discharging my promise to my father.\"\\n\\n\"to be sure it will.  indeed, to say the truth,\\ni am convinced within myself that your father had no idea\\nof your giving them any money at all.  the assistance\\nhe thought of, i dare say, was only such as might be\\nreasonably expected of you; for instance, such as looking\\nout for a comfortable small house for them, helping them\\nto move their things, and sending them presents of fish\\nand game, and so forth, whenever they are in season.\\ni\\'ll lay my life that he meant nothing farther; indeed,\\nit would be very strange and unreasonable if he did.\\ndo but consider, my dear mr. dashwood, how excessively\\ncomfortable your mother-in-law and her daughters may live\\non the interest of seven thousand pounds, besides the\\nthousand pounds belonging to each of the girls, which brings\\nthem in fifty pounds a year a-piece, and, of course,\\nthey will pay their mother for their board out of it.\\naltogether, they will have five hundred a-year amongst them,\\nand what on earth can four women want for more than\\nthat?--they will live so cheap! their housekeeping will\\nbe nothing at all.  they will have no carriage, no horses,\\nand hardly any servants; they will keep no company,\\nand can have no expenses of any kind!  only conceive\\nhow comfortable they will be!  five hundred a year! i am\\nsure i cannot imagine how they will spend half of it;\\nand as to your giving them more, it is quite absurd to think\\nof it.  they will be much more able to give you something.\"\\n\\n\"upon my word,\" said mr. dashwood, \"i believe you\\nare perfectly right.  my father certainly could mean\\nnothing more by his request to me than what you say.\\ni clearly understand it now, and i will strictly fulfil\\nmy engagement by such acts of assistance and kindness\\nto them as you have described.  when my mother removes\\ninto another house my services shall be readily given\\nto accommodate her as far as i can.  some little present\\nof furniture too may be acceptable then.\"\\n\\n\"certainly,\" returned mrs. john dashwood.  \"but, however,\\none thing must be considered.  when your father and mother\\nmoved to norland, though the furniture of stanhill\\nwas sold, all the china, plate, and linen was saved,\\nand is now left to your mother.  her house will therefore\\nbe almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it.\"\\n\\n\"that is a material consideration undoubtedly.\\na valuable legacy indeed! and yet some of the plate would\\nhave been a very pleasant addition to our own stock here.\"\\n\\n\"yes; and the set of breakfast china is twice\\nas handsome as what belongs to this house.  a great\\ndeal too handsome, in my opinion, for any place they\\ncan ever afford to live in.  but, however, so it is.\\nyour father thought only of them.  and i must say this:\\nthat you owe no particular gratitude to him, nor attention\\nto his wishes; for we very well know that if he could,\\nhe would have left almost everything in the world to them.\"\\n\\nthis argument was irresistible.  it gave to his\\nintentions whatever of decision was wanting before; and he\\nfinally resolved, that it would be absolutely unnecessary,\\nif not highly indecorous, to do more for the widow\\nand children of his father, than such kind of neighbourly\\nacts as his own wife pointed out.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 3\\n\\n\\nmrs. dashwood remained at norland several months;\\nnot from any disinclination to move when the sight of every\\nwell known spot ceased to raise the violent emotion which it\\nproduced for a while; for when her spirits began to revive,\\nand her mind became capable of some other exertion than that\\nof heightening its affliction by melancholy remembrances,\\nshe was impatient to be gone, and indefatigable in her inquiries\\nfor a suitable dwelling in the neighbourhood of norland;\\nfor to remove far from that beloved spot was impossible.\\nbut she could hear of no situation that at once answered\\nher notions of comfort and ease, and suited the prudence\\nof her eldest daughter, whose steadier judgment rejected\\nseveral houses as too large for their income, which her\\nmother would have approved.\\n\\nmrs. dashwood had been informed by her husband of the\\nsolemn promise on the part of his son in their favour,\\nwhich gave comfort to his last earthly reflections.\\nshe doubted the sincerity of this assurance no more than he\\nhad doubted it himself, and she thought of it for her daughters\\'\\nsake with satisfaction, though as for herself she was\\npersuaded that a much smaller provision than 7000l would\\nsupport her in affluence.  for their brother\\'s sake, too,\\nfor the sake of his own heart, she rejoiced; and she\\nreproached herself for being unjust to his merit before,\\nin believing him incapable of generosity.  his attentive\\nbehaviour to herself and his sisters convinced her that\\ntheir welfare was dear to him, and, for a long time,\\nshe firmly relied on the liberality of his intentions.\\n\\nthe contempt which she had, very early in their acquaintance,\\nfelt for her daughter-in-law, was very much increased\\nby the farther knowledge of her character, which half\\na year\\'s residence in her family afforded; and perhaps\\nin spite of every consideration of politeness or maternal\\naffection on the side of the former, the two ladies might\\nhave found it impossible to have lived together so long,\\nhad not a particular circumstance occurred to give\\nstill greater eligibility, according to the opinions\\nof mrs. dashwood, to her daughters\\' continuance at norland.\\n\\nthis circumstance was a growing attachment between\\nher eldest girl and the brother of mrs. john dashwood,\\na gentleman-like and pleasing young man, who was introduced\\nto their acquaintance soon after his sister\\'s establishment\\nat norland, and who had since spent the greatest part\\nof his time there.\\n\\nsome mothers might have encouraged the intimacy from\\nmotives of interest, for edward ferrars was the eldest son\\nof a man who had died very rich; and some might have repressed\\nit from motives of prudence, for, except a trifling sum,\\nthe whole of his fortune depended on the will of his mother.\\nbut mrs. dashwood was alike uninfluenced by either consideration.\\nit was enough for her that he appeared to be amiable,\\nthat he loved her daughter, and that elinor returned\\nthe partiality.  it was contrary to every doctrine of\\nher\\'s that difference of fortune should keep any couple\\nasunder who were attracted by resemblance of disposition;\\nand that elinor\\'s merit should not be acknowledged\\nby every one who knew her, was to her comprehension impossible.\\n\\nedward ferrars was not recommended to their good\\nopinion by any peculiar graces of person or address.\\nhe was not handsome, and his manners required intimacy\\nto make them pleasing.  he was too diffident to do justice\\nto himself; but when his natural shyness was overcome,\\nhis behaviour gave every indication of an open,\\naffectionate heart.  his understanding was good,\\nand his education had given it solid improvement.\\nbut he was neither fitted by abilities nor disposition\\nto answer the wishes of his mother and sister, who longed\\nto see him distinguished--as--they hardly knew what.\\nthey wanted him to make a fine figure in the world in some\\nmanner or other.  his mother wished to interest him in\\npolitical concerns, to get him into parliament, or to see\\nhim connected with some of the great men of the day.\\nmrs. john dashwood wished it likewise; but in the mean while,\\ntill one of these superior blessings could be attained, it would\\nhave quieted her ambition to see him driving a barouche.\\nbut edward had no turn for great men or barouches.\\nall his wishes centered in domestic comfort and the quiet\\nof private life.  fortunately he had a younger brother\\nwho was more promising.\\n\\nedward had been staying several weeks in the house\\nbefore he engaged much of mrs. dashwood\\'s attention;\\nfor she was, at that time, in such affliction as rendered\\nher careless of surrounding objects.  she saw only that he\\nwas quiet and unobtrusive, and she liked him for it.\\nhe did not disturb the wretchedness of her mind by\\nill-timed conversation.  she was first called to observe\\nand approve him farther, by a reflection which elinor\\nchanced one day to make on the difference between him\\nand his sister.  it was a contrast which recommended him\\nmost forcibly to her mother.\\n\\n\"it is enough,\" said she; \"to say that he is unlike\\nfanny is enough.  it implies everything amiable.\\ni love him already.\"\\n\\n\"i think you will like him,\" said elinor, \"when you\\nknow more of him.\"\\n\\n\"like him!\" replied her mother with a smile.\\n\"i feel no sentiment of approbation inferior to love.\"\\n\\n\"you may esteem him.\"\\n\\n\"i have never yet known what it was to separate\\nesteem and love.\"\\n\\nmrs. dashwood now took pains to get acquainted with him.\\nher manners were attaching, and soon banished his reserve.\\nshe speedily comprehended all his merits; the persuasion\\nof his regard for elinor perhaps assisted her penetration;\\nbut she really felt assured of his worth: and even that\\nquietness of manner, which militated against all her\\nestablished ideas of what a young man\\'s address ought to be,\\nwas no longer uninteresting when she knew his heart to be\\nwarm and his temper affectionate.\\n\\nno sooner did she perceive any symptom of love\\nin his behaviour to elinor, than she considered their\\nserious attachment as certain, and looked forward\\nto their marriage as rapidly approaching.\\n\\n\"in a few months, my dear marianne.\" said she,\\n\"elinor will, in all probability be settled for life.\\nwe shall miss her; but she will be happy.\"\\n\\n\"oh! mamma, how shall we do without her?\"\\n\\n\"my love, it will be scarcely a separation.\\nwe shall live within a few miles of each other, and shall\\nmeet every day of our lives.  you will gain a brother,\\na real, affectionate brother.  i have the highest opinion\\nin the world of edward\\'s heart.  but you look grave,\\nmarianne; do you disapprove your sister\\'s choice?\"\\n\\n\"perhaps,\" said marianne, \"i may consider it\\nwith some surprise.  edward is very amiable, and i love\\nhim tenderly.  but yet--he is not the kind of young\\nman--there is something wanting--his figure is not striking;\\nit has none of that grace which i should expect\\nin the man who could seriously attach my sister.\\nhis eyes want all that spirit, that fire, which at once\\nannounce virtue and intelligence.  and besides all this,\\ni am afraid, mamma, he has no real taste.  music seems\\nscarcely to attract him, and though he admires elinor\\'s\\ndrawings very much, it is not the admiration of a person\\nwho can understand their worth.  it is evident, in spite of\\nhis frequent attention to her while she draws, that in fact\\nhe knows nothing of the matter.  he admires as a lover,\\nnot as a connoisseur.  to satisfy me, those characters\\nmust be united.  i could not be happy with a man whose\\ntaste did not in every point coincide with my own.\\nhe must enter into all my feelings; the same books,\\nthe same music must charm us both.  oh! mama, how spiritless,\\nhow tame was edward\\'s manner in reading to us last night!\\ni felt for my sister most severely.  yet she bore it\\nwith so much composure, she seemed scarcely to notice it.\\ni could hardly keep my seat.  to hear those beautiful lines\\nwhich have frequently almost driven me wild, pronounced\\nwith such impenetrable calmness, such dreadful indifference!\"--\\n\\n\"he would certainly have done more justice to\\nsimple and elegant prose.  i thought so at the time;\\nbut you would give him cowper.\"\\n\\n\"nay, mamma, if he is not to be animated by cowper!--\\nbut we must allow for difference of taste.  elinor has\\nnot my feelings, and therefore she may overlook it, and\\nbe happy with him.  but it would have broke my heart,\\nhad i loved him, to hear him read with so little sensibility.\\nmama, the more i know of the world, the more am i convinced\\nthat i shall never see a man whom i can really love.\\ni require so much!  he must have all edward\\'s virtues,\\nand his person and manners must ornament his goodness\\nwith every possible charm.\"\\n\\n\"remember, my love, that you are not seventeen.\\nit is yet too early in life to despair of such a happiness.\\nwhy should you be less fortunate than your mother?  in\\none circumstance only, my marianne, may your destiny be\\ndifferent from her\\'s!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 4\\n\\n\\n\"what a pity it is, elinor,\" said marianne,\\n\"that edward should have no taste for drawing.\"\\n\\n\"no taste for drawing!\" replied elinor, \"why should\\nyou think so? he does not draw himself, indeed, but he has\\ngreat pleasure in seeing the performances of other people,\\nand i assure you he is by no means deficient in natural taste,\\nthough he has not had opportunities of improving it.\\nhad he ever been in the way of learning, i think he would\\nhave drawn very well.  he distrusts his own judgment\\nin such matters so much, that he is always unwilling\\nto give his opinion on any picture; but he has an innate\\npropriety and simplicity of taste, which in general\\ndirect him perfectly right.\"\\n\\nmarianne was afraid of offending, and said no more\\non the subject; but the kind of approbation which elinor\\ndescribed as excited in him by the drawings of other\\npeople, was very far from that rapturous delight, which,\\nin her opinion, could alone be called taste.  yet, though\\nsmiling within herself at the mistake, she honoured\\nher sister for that blind partiality to edward which produced it.\\n\\n\"i hope, marianne,\" continued elinor, \"you do not\\nconsider him as deficient in general taste.  indeed, i think\\ni may say that you cannot, for your behaviour to him\\nis perfectly cordial, and if that were your opinion,\\ni am sure you could never be civil to him.\"\\n\\nmarianne hardly knew what to say.  she would\\nnot wound the feelings of her sister on any account,\\nand yet to say what she did not believe was impossible.\\nat length she replied:\\n\\n\"do not be offended, elinor, if my praise of him\\nis not in every thing equal to your sense of his merits.\\ni have not had so many opportunities of estimating the minuter\\npropensities of his mind, his inclinations and tastes,\\nas you have; but i have the highest opinion in the world\\nof his goodness and sense.  i think him every thing that is\\nworthy and amiable.\"\\n\\n\"i am sure,\" replied elinor, with a smile,\\n\"that his dearest friends could not be dissatisfied\\nwith such commendation as that.  i do not perceive\\nhow you could express yourself more warmly.\"\\n\\nmarianne was rejoiced to find her sister so easily pleased.\\n\\n\"of his sense and his goodness,\" continued elinor,\\n\"no one can, i think, be in doubt, who has seen him\\noften enough to engage him in unreserved conversation.\\nthe excellence of his understanding and his principles\\ncan be concealed only by that shyness which too often\\nkeeps him silent.  you know enough of him to do justice\\nto his solid worth.  but of his minuter propensities,\\nas you call them you have from peculiar circumstances\\nbeen kept more ignorant than myself.  he and i have\\nbeen at times thrown a good deal together, while you\\nhave been wholly engrossed on the most affectionate\\nprinciple by my mother.  i have seen a great deal of him,\\nhave studied his sentiments and heard his opinion on\\nsubjects of literature and taste; and, upon the whole,\\ni venture to pronounce that his mind is well-informed,\\nenjoyment of books exceedingly great, his imagination lively,\\nhis observation just and correct, and his taste delicate\\nand pure.  his abilities in every respect improve\\nas much upon acquaintance as his manners and person.\\nat first sight, his address is certainly not striking;\\nand his person can hardly be called handsome, till the\\nexpression of his eyes, which are uncommonly good,\\nand the general sweetness of his countenance, is perceived.\\nat present, i know him so well, that i think him\\nreally handsome; or at least, almost so.  what say you,\\nmarianne?\"\\n\\n\"i shall very soon think him handsome, elinor, if i\\ndo not now.  when you tell me to love him as a brother,\\ni shall no more see imperfection in his face, than i now do\\nin his heart.\"\\n\\nelinor started at this declaration, and was sorry for\\nthe warmth she had been betrayed into, in speaking of him.\\nshe felt that edward stood very high in her opinion.\\nshe believed the regard to be mutual; but she required\\ngreater certainty of it to make marianne\\'s conviction\\nof their attachment agreeable to her.  she knew that\\nwhat marianne and her mother conjectured one moment,\\nthey believed the next--that with them, to wish was to hope,\\nand to hope was to expect.  she tried to explain the real\\nstate of the case to her sister.\\n\\n\"i do not attempt to deny,\" said she, \"that i think\\nvery highly of him--that i greatly esteem, that i like him.\"\\n\\nmarianne here burst forth with indignation--\\n\\n\"esteem him! like him! cold-hearted elinor! oh!\\nworse than cold-hearted! ashamed of being otherwise.\\nuse those words again, and i will leave the room this moment.\"\\n\\nelinor could not help laughing.  \"excuse me,\"\\nsaid she; \"and be assured that i meant no offence to you,\\nby speaking, in so quiet a way, of my own feelings.\\nbelieve them to be stronger than i have declared;\\nbelieve them, in short, to be such as his merit, and the\\nsuspicion--the hope of his affection for me may warrant,\\nwithout imprudence or folly.  but farther than this you must\\nnot believe.  i am by no means assured of his regard for me.\\nthere are moments when the extent of it seems doubtful;\\nand till his sentiments are fully known, you cannot wonder\\nat my wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own partiality,\\nby believing or calling it more than it is.  in my heart\\ni feel little--scarcely any doubt of his preference.\\nbut there are other points to be considered besides\\nhis inclination.  he is very far from being independent.\\nwhat his mother really is we cannot know; but, from fanny\\'s\\noccasional mention of her conduct and opinions, we have\\nnever been disposed to think her amiable; and i am very\\nmuch mistaken if edward is not himself aware that there\\nwould be many difficulties in his way, if he were to wish\\nto marry a woman who had not either a great fortune or\\nhigh rank.\"\\n\\nmarianne was astonished to find how much the imagination\\nof her mother and herself had outstripped the truth.\\n\\n\"and you really are not engaged to him!\" said she.\\n\"yet it certainly soon will happen.  but two advantages\\nwill proceed from this delay.  i shall not lose you so soon,\\nand edward will have greater opportunity of improving\\nthat natural taste for your favourite pursuit which must\\nbe so indispensably necessary to your future felicity.\\noh! if he should be so far stimulated by your genius as to\\nlearn to draw himself, how delightful it would be!\"\\n\\nelinor had given her real opinion to her sister.\\nshe could not consider her partiality for edward\\nin so prosperous a state as marianne had believed it.\\nthere was, at times, a want of spirits about him which,\\nif it did not denote indifference, spoke of something almost\\nas unpromising.  a doubt of her regard, supposing him\\nto feel it, need not give him more than inquietude.\\nit would not be likely to produce that dejection of mind\\nwhich frequently attended him.  a more reasonable cause\\nmight be found in the dependent situation which forbade\\nthe indulgence of his affection.  she knew that his mother\\nneither behaved to him so as to make his home comfortable\\nat present, nor to give him any assurance that he might form\\na home for himself, without strictly attending to her views\\nfor his aggrandizement.  with such a knowledge as this,\\nit was impossible for elinor to feel easy on the subject.\\nshe was far from depending on that result of his preference\\nof her, which her mother and sister still considered\\nas certain.  nay, the longer they were together the more\\ndoubtful seemed the nature of his regard; and sometimes,\\nfor a few painful minutes, she believed it to be no more\\nthan friendship.\\n\\nbut, whatever might really be its limits, it was enough,\\nwhen perceived by his sister, to make her uneasy,\\nand at the same time, (which was still more common,)\\nto make her uncivil.  she took the first opportunity of\\naffronting her mother-in-law on the occasion, talking to\\nher so expressively of her brother\\'s great expectations,\\nof mrs. ferrars\\'s resolution that both her sons should\\nmarry well, and of the danger attending any young woman\\nwho attempted to draw him in; that mrs. dashwood could\\nneither pretend to be unconscious, nor endeavor to be calm.\\nshe gave her an answer which marked her contempt,\\nand instantly left the room, resolving that, whatever might\\nbe the inconvenience or expense of so sudden a removal,\\nher beloved elinor should not be exposed another week\\nto such insinuations.\\n\\nin this state of her spirits, a letter was delivered\\nto her from the post, which contained a proposal\\nparticularly well timed.  it was the offer of a small house,\\non very easy terms, belonging to a relation of her own,\\na gentleman of consequence and property in devonshire.\\nthe letter was from this gentleman himself, and written\\nin the true spirit of friendly accommodation.\\nhe understood that she was in need of a dwelling;\\nand though the house he now offered her was merely a cottage,\\nhe assured her that everything should be done to it which\\nshe might think necessary, if the situation pleased her.\\nhe earnestly pressed her, after giving the particulars\\nof the house and garden, to come with her daughters to\\nbarton park, the place of his own residence, from whence\\nshe might judge, herself, whether barton cottage, for the\\nhouses were in the same parish, could, by any alteration,\\nbe made comfortable to her.  he seemed really anxious to\\naccommodate them and the whole of his letter was written\\nin so friendly a style as could not fail of giving pleasure\\nto his cousin; more especially at a moment when she was\\nsuffering under the cold and unfeeling behaviour of her\\nnearer connections.  she needed no time for deliberation\\nor inquiry.  her resolution was formed as she read.\\nthe situation of barton, in a county so far distant from\\nsussex as devonshire, which, but a few hours before,\\nwould have been a sufficient objection to outweigh every\\npossible advantage belonging to the place, was now its\\nfirst recommendation.  to quit the neighbourhood of norland\\nwas no longer an evil; it was an object of desire;\\nit was a blessing, in comparison of the misery of continuing\\nher daughter-in-law\\'s guest; and to remove for ever\\nfrom that beloved place would be less painful than to\\ninhabit or visit it while such a woman was its mistress.\\nshe instantly wrote sir john middleton her acknowledgment\\nof his kindness, and her acceptance of his proposal;\\nand then hastened to shew both letters to her daughters,\\nthat she might be secure of their approbation before her\\nanswer were sent.\\n\\nelinor had always thought it would be more prudent\\nfor them to settle at some distance from norland,\\nthan immediately amongst their present acquaintance.\\non that head, therefore, it was not for her to oppose\\nher mother\\'s intention of removing into devonshire.\\nthe house, too, as described by sir john, was on so\\nsimple a scale, and the rent so uncommonly moderate,\\nas to leave her no right of objection on either point;\\nand, therefore, though it was not a plan which brought\\nany charm to her fancy, though it was a removal from\\nthe vicinity of norland beyond her wishes, she made\\nno attempt to dissuade her mother from sending a letter\\nof acquiescence.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 5\\n\\n\\nno sooner was her answer dispatched, than mrs. dashwood\\nindulged herself in the pleasure of announcing to her\\nson-in-law and his wife that she was provided with a house,\\nand should incommode them no longer than till every thing were\\nready for her inhabiting it.  they heard her with surprise.\\nmrs. john dashwood said nothing; but her husband civilly\\nhoped that she would not be settled far from norland.\\nshe had great satisfaction in replying that she was going\\ninto devonshire.--edward turned hastily towards her,\\non hearing this, and, in a voice of surprise and concern,\\nwhich required no explanation to her, repeated,\\n\"devonshire! are you, indeed, going there?  so far from hence!\\nand to what part of it?\"  she explained the situation.\\nit was within four miles northward of exeter.\\n\\n\"it is but a cottage,\" she continued, \"but i hope\\nto see many of my friends in it.  a room or two can\\neasily be added; and if my friends find no difficulty\\nin travelling so far to see me, i am sure i will find\\nnone in accommodating them.\"\\n\\nshe concluded with a very kind invitation to\\nmr. and mrs. john dashwood to visit her at barton;\\nand to edward she gave one with still greater affection.\\nthough her late conversation with her daughter-in-law had\\nmade her resolve on remaining at norland no longer than\\nwas unavoidable, it had not produced the smallest effect\\non her in that point to which it principally tended.\\nto separate edward and elinor was as far from being her\\nobject as ever; and she wished to show mrs. john dashwood,\\nby this pointed invitation to her brother, how totally she\\ndisregarded her disapprobation of the match.\\n\\nmr. john dashwood told his mother again and again\\nhow exceedingly sorry he was that she had taken a house at\\nsuch a distance from norland as to prevent his being of any\\nservice to her in removing her furniture.  he really felt\\nconscientiously vexed on the occasion; for the very exertion\\nto which he had limited the performance of his promise to\\nhis father was by this arrangement rendered impracticable.--\\nthe furniture was all sent around by water.  it chiefly\\nconsisted of household linen, plate, china, and books,\\nwith a handsome pianoforte of marianne\\'s.  mrs. john\\ndashwood saw the packages depart with a sigh: she could\\nnot help feeling it hard that as mrs. dashwood\\'s income\\nwould be so trifling in comparison with their own,\\nshe should have any handsome article of furniture.\\n\\nmrs. dashwood took the house for a twelvemonth; it was\\nready furnished, and she might have immediate possession.\\nno difficulty arose on either side in the agreement; and she\\nwaited only for the disposal of her effects at norland,\\nand to determine her future household, before she set\\noff for the west; and this, as she was exceedingly rapid\\nin the performance of everything that interested her,\\nwas soon done.--the horses which were left her by her husband\\nhad been sold soon after his death, and an opportunity\\nnow offering of disposing of her carriage, she agreed\\nto sell that likewise at the earnest advice of her\\neldest daughter.  for the comfort of her children, had she\\nconsulted only her own wishes, she would have kept it;\\nbut the discretion of elinor prevailed.  her wisdom\\ntoo limited the number of their servants to three;\\ntwo maids and a man, with whom they were speedily provided\\nfrom amongst those who had formed their establishment\\nat norland.\\n\\nthe man and one of the maids were sent off immediately\\ninto devonshire, to prepare the house for their mistress\\'s\\narrival; for as lady middleton was entirely unknown\\nto mrs. dashwood, she preferred going directly to the\\ncottage to being a visitor at barton park; and she relied\\nso undoubtingly on sir john\\'s description of the house,\\nas to feel no curiosity to examine it herself till she\\nentered it as her own.  her eagerness to be gone from norland\\nwas preserved from diminution by the evident satisfaction\\nof her daughter-in-law in the prospect of her removal;\\na satisfaction which was but feebly attempted to be concealed\\nunder a cold invitation to her to defer her departure.\\nnow was the time when her son-in-law\\'s promise to his\\nfather might with particular propriety be fulfilled.\\nsince he had neglected to do it on first coming to\\nthe estate, their quitting his house might be looked\\non as the most suitable period for its accomplishment.\\nbut mrs. dashwood began shortly to give over every\\nhope of the kind, and to be convinced, from the general\\ndrift of his discourse, that his assistance extended no\\nfarther than their maintenance for six months at norland.\\nhe so frequently talked of the increasing expenses\\nof housekeeping, and of the perpetual demands upon his purse,\\nwhich a man of any consequence in the world was beyond\\ncalculation exposed to, that he seemed rather to stand\\nin need of more money himself than to have any design of\\ngiving money away.\\n\\nin a very few weeks from the day which brought sir\\njohn middleton\\'s first letter to norland, every thing was\\nso far settled in their future abode as to enable\\nmrs. dashwood and her daughters to begin their journey.\\n\\nmany were the tears shed by them in their last\\nadieus to a place so much beloved.  \"dear, dear norland!\"\\nsaid marianne, as she wandered alone before the house,\\non the last evening of their being there; \"when shall i cease\\nto regret you!--when learn to feel a home elsewhere!--oh!\\nhappy house, could you know what i suffer in now viewing\\nyou from this spot, from whence perhaps i may view\\nyou no more!--and you, ye well-known trees!--but you\\nwill continue the same.--no leaf will decay because we\\nare removed, nor any branch become motionless although we\\ncan observe you no longer!--no; you will continue the same;\\nunconscious of the pleasure or the regret you occasion,\\nand insensible of any change in those who walk under your\\nshade!--but who will remain to enjoy you?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 6\\n\\n\\nthe first part of their journey was performed in too\\nmelancholy a disposition to be otherwise than tedious\\nand unpleasant.  but as they drew towards the end of it,\\ntheir interest in the appearance of a country which they\\nwere to inhabit overcame their dejection, and a view of\\nbarton valley as they entered it gave them cheerfulness.\\nit was a pleasant fertile spot, well wooded, and rich\\nin pasture.  after winding along it for more than a mile,\\nthey reached their own house.  a small green court was\\nthe whole of its demesne in front; and a neat wicket gate\\nadmitted them into it.\\n\\nas a house, barton cottage, though small, was comfortable\\nand compact; but as a cottage it was defective, for the\\nbuilding was regular, the roof was tiled, the window\\nshutters were not painted green, nor were the walls covered\\nwith honeysuckles.  a narrow passage led directly through\\nthe house into the garden behind.  on each side of the\\nentrance was a sitting room, about sixteen feet square;\\nand beyond them were the offices and the stairs.\\nfour bed-rooms and two garrets formed the rest of the house.\\nit had not been built many years and was in good repair.\\nin comparison of norland, it was poor and small indeed!--but\\nthe tears which recollection called forth as they entered\\nthe house were soon dried away.  they were cheered\\nby the joy of the servants on their arrival, and each\\nfor the sake of the others resolved to appear happy.\\nit was very early in september; the season was fine,\\nand from first seeing the place under the advantage\\nof good weather, they received an impression in its\\nfavour which was of material service in recommending\\nit to their lasting approbation.\\n\\nthe situation of the house was good.  high hills rose\\nimmediately behind, and at no great distance on each side;\\nsome of which were open downs, the others cultivated and woody.\\nthe village of barton was chiefly on one of these hills,\\nand formed a pleasant view from the cottage windows.\\nthe prospect in front was more extensive; it commanded the\\nwhole of the valley, and reached into the country beyond.\\nthe hills which surrounded the cottage terminated\\nthe valley in that direction; under another name,\\nand in another course, it branched out again between two\\nof the steepest of them.\\n\\nwith the size and furniture of the house mrs. dashwood\\nwas upon the whole well satisfied; for though her former\\nstyle of life rendered many additions to the latter\\nindispensable, yet to add and improve was a delight to her;\\nand she had at this time ready money enough to supply all\\nthat was wanted of greater elegance to the apartments.\\n\"as for the house itself, to be sure,\" said she, \"it is\\ntoo small for our family, but we will make ourselves\\ntolerably comfortable for the present, as it is too late\\nin the year for improvements.  perhaps in the spring,\\nif i have plenty of money, as i dare say i shall, we may\\nthink about building.  these parlors are both too small\\nfor such parties of our friends as i hope to see often\\ncollected here; and i have some thoughts of throwing the\\npassage into one of them with perhaps a part of the other,\\nand so leave the remainder of that other for an entrance;\\nthis, with a new drawing room which may be easily added,\\nand a bed-chamber and garret above, will make it a very snug\\nlittle cottage.  i could wish the stairs were handsome.\\nbut one must not expect every thing; though i suppose it\\nwould be no difficult matter to widen them.  i shall see\\nhow much i am before-hand with the world in the spring,\\nand we will plan our improvements accordingly.\"\\n\\nin the mean time, till all these alterations could\\nbe made from the savings of an income of five hundred\\na-year by a woman who never saved in her life, they were\\nwise enough to be contented with the house as it was;\\nand each of them was busy in arranging their particular\\nconcerns, and endeavoring, by placing around them books\\nand other possessions, to form themselves a home.\\nmarianne\\'s pianoforte was unpacked and properly disposed of;\\nand elinor\\'s drawings were affixed to the walls of their\\nsitting room.\\n\\nin such employments as these they were interrupted\\nsoon after breakfast the next day by the entrance of\\ntheir landlord, who called to welcome them to barton,\\nand to offer them every accommodation from his own house\\nand garden in which theirs might at present be deficient.\\nsir john middleton was a good looking man about forty.\\nhe had formerly visited at stanhill, but it was too long\\nfor his young cousins to remember him.  his countenance\\nwas thoroughly good-humoured; and his manners were\\nas friendly as the style of his letter.  their arrival\\nseemed to afford him real satisfaction, and their comfort\\nto be an object of real solicitude to him.  he said much\\nof his earnest desire of their living in the most sociable\\nterms with his family, and pressed them so cordially\\nto dine at barton park every day till they were better\\nsettled at home, that, though his entreaties were carried\\nto a point of perseverance beyond civility, they could\\nnot give offence.  his kindness was not confined to words;\\nfor within an hour after he left them, a large basket\\nfull of garden stuff and fruit arrived from the park,\\nwhich was followed before the end of the day by a present\\nof game.  he insisted, moreover, on conveying all their\\nletters to and from the post for them, and would not be\\ndenied the satisfaction of sending them his newspaper\\nevery day.\\n\\nlady middleton had sent a very civil message by him,\\ndenoting her intention of waiting on mrs. dashwood as soon as\\nshe could be assured that her visit would be no inconvenience;\\nand as this message was answered by an invitation\\nequally polite, her ladyship was introduced to them the next day.\\n\\nthey were, of course, very anxious to see a person on\\nwhom so much of their comfort at barton must depend; and the\\nelegance of her appearance was favourable to their wishes.\\nlady middleton was not more than six or seven and twenty;\\nher face was handsome, her figure tall and striking,\\nand her address graceful.  her manners had all the elegance\\nwhich her husband\\'s wanted.  but they would have been\\nimproved by some share of his frankness and warmth;\\nand her visit was long enough to detract something from\\ntheir first admiration, by shewing that, though perfectly\\nwell-bred, she was reserved, cold, and had nothing to say\\nfor herself beyond the most common-place inquiry or remark.\\n\\nconversation however was not wanted, for sir john\\nwas very chatty, and lady middleton had taken the wise\\nprecaution of bringing with her their eldest child, a fine\\nlittle boy about six years old, by which means there was\\none subject always to be recurred to by the ladies in case\\nof extremity, for they had to enquire his name and age,\\nadmire his beauty, and ask him questions which his mother\\nanswered for him, while he hung about her and held\\ndown his head, to the great surprise of her ladyship,\\nwho wondered at his being so shy before company, as he\\ncould make noise enough at home.  on every formal visit\\na child ought to be of the party, by way of provision\\nfor discourse.  in the present case it took up ten minutes\\nto determine whether the boy were most like his father\\nor mother, and in what particular he resembled either,\\nfor of course every body differed, and every body was\\nastonished at the opinion of the others.\\n\\nan opportunity was soon to be given to the dashwoods\\nof debating on the rest of the children, as sir john\\nwould not leave the house without securing their promise\\nof dining at the park the next day.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 7\\n\\n\\nbarton park was about half a mile from the cottage.\\nthe ladies had passed near it in their way along the valley,\\nbut it was screened from their view at home by the\\nprojection of a hill.  the house was large and handsome;\\nand the middletons lived in a style of equal hospitality\\nand elegance.  the former was for sir john\\'s gratification,\\nthe latter for that of his lady.  they were scarcely\\never without some friends staying with them in the house,\\nand they kept more company of every kind than any other\\nfamily in the neighbourhood.  it was necessary to the\\nhappiness of both; for however dissimilar in temper\\nand outward behaviour, they strongly resembled each other\\nin that total want of talent and taste which confined\\ntheir employments, unconnected with such as society produced,\\nwithin a very narrow compass.  sir john was a sportsman,\\nlady middleton a mother.  he hunted and shot, and she\\nhumoured her children; and these were their only resources.\\nlady middleton had the advantage of being able to spoil her\\nchildren all the year round, while sir john\\'s independent\\nemployments were in existence only half the time.\\ncontinual engagements at home and abroad, however,\\nsupplied all the deficiencies of nature and education;\\nsupported the good spirits of sir john, and gave exercise\\nto the good breeding of his wife.\\n\\nlady middleton piqued herself upon the elegance\\nof her table, and of all her domestic arrangements;\\nand from this kind of vanity was her greatest enjoyment\\nin any of their parties.  but sir john\\'s satisfaction\\nin society was much more real; he delighted in collecting\\nabout him more young people than his house would hold,\\nand the noisier they were the better was he pleased.\\nhe was a blessing to all the juvenile part of the neighbourhood,\\nfor in summer he was for ever forming parties to eat cold\\nham and chicken out of doors, and in winter his private\\nballs were numerous enough for any young lady who was not\\nsuffering under the unsatiable appetite of fifteen.\\n\\nthe arrival of a new family in the country was always\\na matter of joy to him, and in every point of view he was\\ncharmed with the inhabitants he had now procured for his\\ncottage at barton.  the miss dashwoods were young, pretty,\\nand unaffected.  it was enough to secure his good opinion;\\nfor to be unaffected was all that a pretty girl could\\nwant to make her mind as captivating as her person.\\nthe friendliness of his disposition made him happy in\\naccommodating those, whose situation might be considered,\\nin comparison with the past, as unfortunate.  in showing\\nkindness to his cousins therefore he had the real satisfaction\\nof a good heart; and in settling a family of females only\\nin his cottage, he had all the satisfaction of a sportsman;\\nfor a sportsman, though he esteems only those of his sex who\\nare sportsmen likewise, is not often desirous of encouraging\\ntheir taste by admitting them to a residence within his own\\nmanor.\\n\\nmrs. dashwood and her daughters were met at the door\\nof the house by sir john, who welcomed them to barton\\npark with unaffected sincerity; and as he attended them\\nto the drawing room repeated to the young ladies the concern\\nwhich the same subject had drawn from him the day before,\\nat being unable to get any smart young men to meet them.\\nthey would see, he said, only one gentleman there\\nbesides himself; a particular friend who was staying at\\nthe park, but who was neither very young nor very gay.\\nhe hoped they would all excuse the smallness of the party,\\nand could assure them it should never happen so again.\\nhe had been to several families that morning in hopes\\nof procuring some addition to their number, but it\\nwas moonlight and every body was full of engagements.\\nluckily lady middleton\\'s mother had arrived at barton\\nwithin the last hour, and as she was a very cheerful\\nagreeable woman, he hoped the young ladies would not find\\nit so very dull as they might imagine.  the young ladies,\\nas well as their mother, were perfectly satisfied with\\nhaving two entire strangers of the party, and wished for\\nno more.\\n\\nmrs. jennings, lady middleton\\'s mother, was a\\ngood-humoured, merry, fat, elderly woman, who talked a\\ngreat deal, seemed very happy, and rather vulgar.  she was full\\nof jokes and laughter, and before dinner was over had said\\nmany witty things on the subject of lovers and husbands;\\nhoped they had not left their hearts behind them in sussex,\\nand pretended to see them blush whether they did or not.\\nmarianne was vexed at it for her sister\\'s sake, and turned\\nher eyes towards elinor to see how she bore these attacks,\\nwith an earnestness which gave elinor far more pain than\\ncould arise from such common-place raillery as mrs. jennings\\'s.\\n\\ncolonel brandon, the friend of sir john, seemed no\\nmore adapted by resemblance of manner to be his friend,\\nthan lady middleton was to be his wife, or mrs. jennings\\nto be lady middleton\\'s mother.  he was silent and grave.\\nhis appearance however was not unpleasing, in spite\\nof his being in the opinion of marianne and margaret\\nan absolute old bachelor, for he was on the wrong side\\nof five and thirty; but though his face was not handsome,\\nhis countenance was sensible, and his address was\\nparticularly gentlemanlike.\\n\\nthere was nothing in any of the party which could\\nrecommend them as companions to the dashwoods; but the cold\\ninsipidity of lady middleton was so particularly repulsive,\\nthat in comparison of it the gravity of colonel brandon,\\nand even the boisterous mirth of sir john and his\\nmother-in-law was interesting.  lady middleton seemed\\nto be roused to enjoyment only by the entrance of her\\nfour noisy children after dinner, who pulled her about,\\ntore her clothes, and put an end to every kind of discourse\\nexcept what related to themselves.\\n\\nin the evening, as marianne was discovered to be musical,\\nshe was invited to play.  the instrument was unlocked,\\nevery body prepared to be charmed, and marianne,\\nwho sang very well, at their request went through the\\nchief of the songs which lady middleton had brought into\\nthe family on her marriage, and which perhaps had lain\\never since in the same position on the pianoforte,\\nfor her ladyship had celebrated that event by giving\\nup music, although by her mother\\'s account, she had\\nplayed extremely well, and by her own was very fond of it.\\n\\nmarianne\\'s performance was highly applauded.\\nsir john was loud in his admiration at the end of every song,\\nand as loud in his conversation with the others while every\\nsong lasted.  lady middleton frequently called him to order,\\nwondered how any one\\'s attention could be diverted from music\\nfor a moment, and asked marianne to sing a particular song\\nwhich marianne had just finished.  colonel brandon alone,\\nof all the party, heard her without being in raptures.\\nhe paid her only the compliment of attention; and she felt\\na respect for him on the occasion, which the others had\\nreasonably forfeited by their shameless want of taste.\\nhis pleasure in music, though it amounted not to that\\necstatic delight which alone could sympathize with her own,\\nwas estimable when contrasted against the horrible\\ninsensibility of the others; and she was reasonable enough\\nto allow that a man of five and thirty might well have\\noutlived all acuteness of feeling and every exquisite\\npower of enjoyment.  she was perfectly disposed to make\\nevery allowance for the colonel\\'s advanced state of life\\nwhich humanity required.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 8\\n\\n\\nmrs. jennings was a widow with an ample jointure.\\nshe had only two daughters, both of whom she had lived\\nto see respectably married, and she had now therefore\\nnothing to do but to marry all the rest of the world.\\nin the promotion of this object she was zealously active,\\nas far as her ability reached; and missed no opportunity\\nof projecting weddings among all the young people\\nof her acquaintance.  she was remarkably quick in the\\ndiscovery of attachments, and had enjoyed the advantage\\nof raising the blushes and the vanity of many a young\\nlady by insinuations of her power over such a young man;\\nand this kind of discernment enabled her soon after her\\narrival at barton decisively to pronounce that colonel\\nbrandon was very much in love with marianne dashwood.\\nshe rather suspected it to be so, on the very first\\nevening of their being together, from his listening\\nso attentively while she sang to them; and when the visit\\nwas returned by the middletons\\' dining at the cottage,\\nthe fact was ascertained by his listening to her again.\\nit must be so.  she was perfectly convinced of it.\\nit would be an excellent match, for he was rich, and she\\nwas handsome.  mrs. jennings had been anxious to see\\ncolonel brandon well married, ever since her connection\\nwith sir john first brought him to her knowledge;\\nand she was always anxious to get a good husband for every\\npretty girl.\\n\\nthe immediate advantage to herself was by no means\\ninconsiderable, for it supplied her with endless jokes\\nagainst them both.  at the park she laughed at the colonel,\\nand in the cottage at marianne.  to the former her\\nraillery was probably, as far as it regarded only himself,\\nperfectly indifferent; but to the latter it was at\\nfirst incomprehensible; and when its object was understood,\\nshe hardly knew whether most to laugh at its absurdity,\\nor censure its impertinence, for she considered it as an\\nunfeeling reflection on the colonel\\'s advanced years,\\nand on his forlorn condition as an old bachelor.\\n\\nmrs. dashwood, who could not think a man five years\\nyounger than herself, so exceedingly ancient as he appeared\\nto the youthful fancy of her daughter, ventured to clear\\nmrs. jennings from the probability of wishing to throw\\nridicule on his age.\\n\\n\"but at least, mamma, you cannot deny the absurdity\\nof the accusation, though you may not think it intentionally\\nill-natured.  colonel brandon is certainly younger than\\nmrs. jennings, but he is old enough to be my father;\\nand if he were ever animated enough to be in love,\\nmust have long outlived every sensation of the kind.\\nit is too ridiculous!  when is a man to be safe from such wit,\\nif age and infirmity will not protect him?\"\\n\\n\"infirmity!\" said elinor, \"do you call colonel brandon\\ninfirm?  i can easily suppose that his age may appear much\\ngreater to you than to my mother; but you can hardly\\ndeceive yourself as to his having the use of his limbs!\"\\n\\n\"did not you hear him complain of the rheumatism?\\nand is not that the commonest infirmity of declining life?\"\\n\\n\"my dearest child,\" said her mother, laughing,\\n\"at this rate you must be in continual terror of my decay;\\nand it must seem to you a miracle that my life has been\\nextended to the advanced age of forty.\"\\n\\n\"mamma, you are not doing me justice.  i know very well\\nthat colonel brandon is not old enough to make his friends\\nyet apprehensive of losing him in the course of nature.\\nhe may live twenty years longer.  but thirty-five has\\nnothing to do with matrimony.\"\\n\\n\"perhaps,\" said elinor, \"thirty-five and seventeen had\\nbetter not have any thing to do with matrimony together.\\nbut if there should by any chance happen to be a woman\\nwho is single at seven and twenty, i should not think\\ncolonel brandon\\'s being thirty-five any objection to his\\nmarrying her.\"\\n\\n\"a woman of seven and twenty,\" said marianne,\\nafter pausing a moment, \"can never hope to feel or inspire\\naffection again, and if her home be uncomfortable,\\nor her fortune small, i can suppose that she might\\nbring herself to submit to the offices of a nurse,\\nfor the sake of the provision and security of a wife.\\nin his marrying such a woman therefore there would be\\nnothing unsuitable.  it would be a compact of convenience,\\nand the world would be satisfied.  in my eyes it would\\nbe no marriage at all, but that would be nothing.\\nto me it would seem only a commercial exchange, in which\\neach wished to be benefited at the expense of the other.\"\\n\\n\"it would be impossible, i know,\" replied elinor,\\n\"to convince you that a woman of seven and twenty could\\nfeel for a man of thirty-five anything near enough\\nto love, to make him a desirable companion to her.\\nbut i must object to your dooming colonel brandon and\\nhis wife to the constant confinement of a sick chamber,\\nmerely because he chanced to complain yesterday (a\\nvery cold damp day) of a slight rheumatic feel in one\\nof his shoulders.\"\\n\\n\"but he talked of flannel waistcoats,\" said marianne;\\n\"and with me a flannel waistcoat is invariably connected\\nwith aches, cramps, rheumatisms, and every species of\\nailment that can afflict the old and the feeble.\"\\n\\n\"had he been only in a violent fever, you would not\\nhave despised him half so much.  confess, marianne, is not\\nthere something interesting to you in the flushed cheek,\\nhollow eye, and quick pulse of a fever?\"\\n\\nsoon after this, upon elinor\\'s leaving the room,\\n\"mamma,\" said marianne, \"i have an alarm on the subject\\nof illness which i cannot conceal from you.  i am sure\\nedward ferrars is not well.  we have now been here almost\\na fortnight, and yet he does not come.  nothing but real\\nindisposition could occasion this extraordinary delay.\\nwhat else can detain him at norland?\"\\n\\n\"had you any idea of his coming so soon?\"\\nsaid mrs. dashwood.  \"i had none.  on the contrary,\\nif i have felt any anxiety at all on the subject, it has\\nbeen in recollecting that he sometimes showed a want\\nof pleasure and readiness in accepting my invitation,\\nwhen i talked of his coming to barton.  does elinor\\nexpect him already?\"\\n\\n\"i have never mentioned it to her, but of course\\nshe must.\"\\n\\n\"i rather think you are mistaken, for when i\\nwas talking to her yesterday of getting a new grate\\nfor the spare bedchamber, she observed that there\\nwas no immediate hurry for it, as it was not likely\\nthat the room would be wanted for some time.\"\\n\\n\"how strange this is! what can be the meaning of it!\\nbut the whole of their behaviour to each other has been\\nunaccountable! how cold, how composed were their last\\nadieus! how languid their conversation the last evening\\nof their being together! in edward\\'s farewell there was no\\ndistinction between elinor and me: it was the good wishes\\nof an affectionate brother to both.  twice did i leave\\nthem purposely together in the course of the last morning,\\nand each time did he most unaccountably follow me out\\nof the room.  and elinor, in quitting norland and edward,\\ncried not as i did.  even now her self-command is invariable.\\nwhen is she dejected or melancholy? when does she try\\nto avoid society, or appear restless and dissatisfied\\nin it?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 9\\n\\n\\nthe dashwoods were now settled at barton with tolerable\\ncomfort to themselves.  the house and the garden, with all\\nthe objects surrounding them, were now become familiar,\\nand the ordinary pursuits which had given to norland\\nhalf its charms were engaged in again with far greater\\nenjoyment than norland had been able to afford, since the\\nloss of their father.  sir john middleton, who called\\non them every day for the first fortnight, and who was\\nnot in the habit of seeing much occupation at home,\\ncould not conceal his amazement on finding them always employed.\\n\\ntheir visitors, except those from barton park,\\nwere not many; for, in spite of sir john\\'s urgent entreaties\\nthat they would mix more in the neighbourhood, and repeated\\nassurances of his carriage being always at their service,\\nthe independence of mrs. dashwood\\'s spirit overcame the\\nwish of society for her children; and she was resolute\\nin declining to visit any family beyond the distance\\nof a walk.  there were but few who could be so classed;\\nand it was not all of them that were attainable.\\nabout a mile and a half from the cottage, along the narrow\\nwinding valley of allenham, which issued from that of barton,\\nas formerly described, the girls had, in one of their\\nearliest walks, discovered an ancient respectable looking\\nmansion which, by reminding them a little of norland,\\ninterested their imagination and made them wish to be\\nbetter acquainted with it.  but they learnt, on enquiry,\\nthat its possessor, an elderly lady of very good character,\\nwas unfortunately too infirm to mix with the world,\\nand never stirred from home.\\n\\nthe whole country about them abounded in beautiful walks.\\nthe high downs which invited them from almost every window\\nof the cottage to seek the exquisite enjoyment of air\\non their summits, were a happy alternative when the dirt\\nof the valleys beneath shut up their superior beauties;\\nand towards one of these hills did marianne and margaret\\none memorable morning direct their steps, attracted by the\\npartial sunshine of a showery sky, and unable longer to bear\\nthe confinement which the settled rain of the two preceding\\ndays had occasioned.  the weather was not tempting enough\\nto draw the two others from their pencil and their book,\\nin spite of marianne\\'s declaration that the day would\\nbe lastingly fair, and that every threatening cloud would\\nbe drawn off from their hills; and the two girls set off\\ntogether.\\n\\nthey gaily ascended the downs, rejoicing in their own\\npenetration at every glimpse of blue sky; and when they\\ncaught in their faces the animating gales of a high\\nsouth-westerly wind, they pitied the fears which had prevented\\ntheir mother and elinor from sharing such delightful sensations.\\n\\n\"is there a felicity in the world,\" said marianne,\\n\"superior to this?--margaret, we will walk here at least\\ntwo hours.\"\\n\\nmargaret agreed, and they pursued their way against\\nthe wind, resisting it with laughing delight for about\\ntwenty minutes longer, when suddenly the clouds united over\\ntheir heads, and a driving rain set full in their face.--\\nchagrined and surprised, they were obliged, though unwillingly,\\nto turn back, for no shelter was nearer than their own house.\\none consolation however remained for them, to which the\\nexigence of the moment gave more than usual propriety;\\nit was that of running with all possible speed down the steep\\nside of the hill which led immediately to their garden gate.\\n\\nthey set off.  marianne had at first the advantage,\\nbut a false step brought her suddenly to the ground;\\nand margaret, unable to stop herself to assist her,\\nwas involuntarily hurried along, and reached the bottom\\nin safety.\\n\\na gentleman carrying a gun, with two pointers\\nplaying round him, was passing up the hill and within\\na few yards of marianne, when her accident happened.\\nhe put down his gun and ran to her assistance.  she had\\nraised herself from the ground, but her foot had been\\ntwisted in her fall, and she was scarcely able to stand.\\nthe gentleman offered his services; and perceiving that her\\nmodesty declined what her situation rendered necessary,\\ntook her up in his arms without farther delay, and carried\\nher down the hill.  then passing through the garden,\\nthe gate of which had been left open by margaret, he bore her\\ndirectly into the house, whither margaret was just arrived,\\nand quitted not his hold till he had seated her in a chair\\nin the parlour.\\n\\nelinor and her mother rose up in amazement at\\ntheir entrance, and while the eyes of both were fixed\\non him with an evident wonder and a secret admiration\\nwhich equally sprung from his appearance, he apologized\\nfor his intrusion by relating its cause, in a manner\\nso frank and so graceful that his person, which was\\nuncommonly handsome, received additional charms from his voice\\nand expression.  had he been even old, ugly, and vulgar,\\nthe gratitude and kindness of mrs. dashwood would\\nhave been secured by any act of attention to her child;\\nbut the influence of youth, beauty, and elegance,\\ngave an interest to the action which came home to her feelings.\\n\\nshe thanked him again and again; and, with a sweetness\\nof address which always attended her, invited him to\\nbe seated.  but this he declined, as he was dirty and wet.\\nmrs. dashwood then begged to know to whom she was obliged.\\nhis name, he replied, was willoughby, and his present\\nhome was at allenham, from whence he hoped she would\\nallow him the honour of calling tomorrow to enquire\\nafter miss dashwood.  the honour was readily granted,\\nand he then departed, to make himself still more interesting,\\nin the midst of a heavy rain.\\n\\nhis manly beauty and more than common gracefulness\\nwere instantly the theme of general admiration,\\nand the laugh which his gallantry raised against marianne\\nreceived particular spirit from his exterior attractions.--\\nmarianne herself had seen less of his person that the rest,\\nfor the confusion which crimsoned over her face, on his\\nlifting her up, had robbed her of the power of regarding\\nhim after their entering the house.  but she had seen\\nenough of him to join in all the admiration of the others,\\nand with an energy which always adorned her praise.\\nhis person and air were equal to what her fancy had ever\\ndrawn for the hero of a favourite story; and in his carrying\\nher into the house with so little previous formality, there\\nwas a rapidity of thought which particularly recommended\\nthe action to her.  every circumstance belonging to him\\nwas interesting.  his name was good, his residence was in\\ntheir favourite village, and she soon found out that of all\\nmanly dresses a shooting-jacket was the most becoming.\\nher imagination was busy, her reflections were pleasant,\\nand the pain of a sprained ankle was disregarded.\\n\\nsir john called on them as soon as the next interval\\nof fair weather that morning allowed him to get out\\nof doors; and marianne\\'s accident being related to him,\\nhe was eagerly asked whether he knew any gentleman\\nof the name of willoughby at allenham.\\n\\n\"willoughby!\" cried sir john; \"what, is he\\nin the country? that is good news however; i will\\nride over tomorrow, and ask him to dinner on thursday.\"\\n\\n\"you know him then,\" said mrs. dashwood.\\n\\n\"know him! to be sure i do.  why, he is down here\\nevery year.\"\\n\\n\"and what sort of a young man is he?\"\\n\\n\"as good a kind of fellow as ever lived, i assure you.\\na very decent shot, and there is not a bolder rider\\nin england.\"\\n\\n\"and is that all you can say for him?\" cried marianne,\\nindignantly.  \"but what are his manners on more intimate\\nacquaintance? what his pursuits, his talents, and genius?\"\\n\\nsir john was rather puzzled.\\n\\n\"upon my soul,\" said he, \"i do not know much about him\\nas to all that.  but he is a pleasant, good humoured fellow,\\nand has got the nicest little black bitch of a pointer\\ni ever saw.  was she out with him today?\"\\n\\nbut marianne could no more satisfy him as to the\\ncolour of mr. willoughby\\'s pointer, than he could\\ndescribe to her the shades of his mind.\\n\\n\"but who is he?\" said elinor.  \"where does he come\\nfrom?  has he a house at allenham?\"\\n\\non this point sir john could give more certain intelligence;\\nand he told them that mr. willoughby had no property\\nof his own in the country; that he resided there only\\nwhile he was visiting the old lady at allenham court,\\nto whom he was related, and whose possessions he was\\nto inherit; adding, \"yes, yes, he is very well worth\\ncatching i can tell you, miss dashwood; he has a pretty\\nlittle estate of his own in somersetshire besides;\\nand if i were you, i would not give him up to my\\nyounger sister, in spite of all this tumbling down hills.\\nmiss marianne must not expect to have all the men to herself.\\nbrandon will be jealous, if she does not take care.\"\\n\\n\"i do not believe,\" said mrs. dashwood, with a\\ngood humoured smile, \"that mr. willoughby will be incommoded\\nby the attempts of either of my daughters towards what\\nyou call catching him.  it is not an employment to which\\nthey have been brought up.  men are very safe with us,\\nlet them be ever so rich.  i am glad to find, however,\\nfrom what you say, that he is a respectable young man,\\nand one whose acquaintance will not be ineligible.\"\\n\\n\"he is as good a sort of fellow, i believe,\\nas ever lived,\" repeated sir john.  \"i remember\\nlast christmas at a little hop at the park, he danced\\nfrom eight o\\'clock till four, without once sitting down.\"\\n\\n\"did he indeed?\" cried marianne with sparkling eyes,\\n\"and with elegance, with spirit?\"\\n\\n\"yes; and he was up again at eight to ride to covert.\"\\n\\n\"that is what i like; that is what a young man ought\\nto be.  whatever be his pursuits, his eagerness in them\\nshould know no moderation, and leave him no sense of fatigue.\"\\n\\n\"aye, aye, i see how it will be,\" said sir john, \"i see\\nhow it will be.  you will be setting your cap at him now,\\nand never think of poor brandon.\"\\n\\n\"that is an expression, sir john,\" said marianne,\\nwarmly, \"which i particularly dislike.  i abhor every\\ncommon-place phrase by which wit is intended; and \\'setting\\none\\'s cap at a man,\\' or \\'making a conquest,\\' are the most\\nodious of all.  their tendency is gross and illiberal;\\nand if their construction could ever be deemed clever,\\ntime has long ago destroyed all its ingenuity.\"\\n\\nsir john did not much understand this reproof;\\nbut he laughed as heartily as if he did, and then replied,\\n\\n\"ay, you will make conquests enough, i dare say,\\none way or other.  poor brandon! he is quite smitten already,\\nand he is very well worth setting your cap at, i can\\ntell you, in spite of all this tumbling about and spraining\\nof ankles.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 10\\n\\n\\nmarianne\\'s preserver, as margaret, with more elegance\\nthan precision, styled willoughby, called at the cottage\\nearly the next morning to make his personal enquiries.\\nhe was received by mrs. dashwood with more than politeness;\\nwith a kindness which sir john\\'s account of him and her own\\ngratitude prompted; and every thing that passed during\\nthe visit tended to assure him of the sense, elegance,\\nmutual affection, and domestic comfort of the family\\nto whom accident had now introduced him.  of their\\npersonal charms he had not required a second interview\\nto be convinced.\\n\\nmiss dashwood had a delicate complexion,\\nregular features, and a remarkably pretty figure.\\nmarianne was still handsomer.  her form, though not so\\ncorrect as her sister\\'s, in having the advantage of height,\\nwas more striking; and her face was so lovely, that when\\nin the common cant of praise, she was called a beautiful girl,\\ntruth was less violently outraged than usually happens.\\nher skin was very brown, but, from its transparency,\\nher complexion was uncommonly brilliant; her features\\nwere all good; her smile was sweet and attractive;\\nand in her eyes, which were very dark, there was a life,\\na spirit, an eagerness, which could hardily be seen\\nwithout delight.  from willoughby their expression was at\\nfirst held back, by the embarrassment which the remembrance\\nof his assistance created.  but when this passed away,\\nwhen her spirits became collected, when she saw that to the\\nperfect good-breeding of the gentleman, he united frankness\\nand vivacity, and above all, when she heard him declare,\\nthat of music and dancing he was passionately fond,\\nshe gave him such a look of approbation as secured the\\nlargest share of his discourse to herself for the rest\\nof his stay.\\n\\nit was only necessary to mention any favourite\\namusement to engage her to talk.  she could not be\\nsilent when such points were introduced, and she\\nhad neither shyness nor reserve in their discussion.\\nthey speedily discovered that their enjoyment of dancing\\nand music was mutual, and that it arose from a general\\nconformity of judgment in all that related to either.\\nencouraged by this to a further examination of his opinions,\\nshe proceeded to question him on the subject of books;\\nher favourite authors were brought forward and dwelt\\nupon with so rapturous a delight, that any young man of\\nfive and twenty must have been insensible indeed, not to\\nbecome an immediate convert to the excellence of such works,\\nhowever disregarded before.  their taste was strikingly alike.\\nthe same books, the same passages were idolized by each--\\nor if any difference appeared, any objection arose,\\nit lasted no longer than till the force of her arguments\\nand the brightness of her eyes could be displayed.\\nhe acquiesced in all her decisions, caught all her enthusiasm;\\nand long before his visit concluded, they conversed\\nwith the familiarity of a long-established acquaintance.\\n\\n\"well, marianne,\" said elinor, as soon as he had left them,\\n\"for one morning i think you have done pretty well.\\nyou have already ascertained mr. willoughby\\'s opinion in\\nalmost every matter of importance.  you know what he thinks\\nof cowper and scott; you are certain of his estimating\\ntheir beauties as he ought, and you have received every\\nassurance of his admiring pope no more than is proper.\\nbut how is your acquaintance to be long supported, under such\\nextraordinary despatch of every subject for discourse?\\nyou will soon have exhausted each favourite topic.\\nanother meeting will suffice to explain his sentiments\\non picturesque beauty, and second marriages, and then\\nyou can have nothing farther to ask.\"--\\n\\n\"elinor,\" cried marianne, \"is this fair? is this\\njust? are my ideas so scanty?  but i see what you mean.\\ni have been too much at my ease, too happy, too frank.\\ni have erred against every common-place notion of decorum;\\ni have been open and sincere where i ought to have\\nbeen reserved, spiritless, dull, and deceitful--had\\ni talked only of the weather and the roads, and had i\\nspoken only once in ten minutes, this reproach would have\\nbeen spared.\"\\n\\n\"my love,\" said her mother, \"you must not be offended\\nwith elinor--she was only in jest.  i should scold\\nher myself, if she were capable of wishing to check\\nthe delight of your conversation with our new friend.\"--\\nmarianne was softened in a moment.\\n\\nwilloughby, on his side, gave every proof of his\\npleasure in their acquaintance, which an evident wish\\nof improving it could offer.  he came to them every day.\\nto enquire after marianne was at first his excuse; but the\\nencouragement of his reception, to which every day gave\\ngreater kindness, made such an excuse unnecessary before it\\nhad ceased to be possible, by marianne\\'s perfect recovery.\\nshe was confined for some days to the house; but never had\\nany confinement been less irksome.  willoughby was a young\\nman of good abilities, quick imagination, lively spirits,\\nand open, affectionate manners.  he was exactly formed\\nto engage marianne\\'s heart, for with all this, he joined\\nnot only a captivating person, but a natural ardour\\nof mind which was now roused and increased by the example\\nof her own, and which recommended him to her affection\\nbeyond every thing else.\\n\\nhis society became gradually her most exquisite enjoyment.\\nthey read, they talked, they sang together; his musical\\ntalents were considerable; and he read with all the\\nsensibility and spirit which edward had unfortunately wanted.\\n\\nin mrs. dashwood\\'s estimation he was as faultless\\nas in marianne\\'s; and elinor saw nothing to censure in him\\nbut a propensity, in which he strongly resembled and peculiarly\\ndelighted her sister, of saying too much what he thought on\\nevery occasion, without attention to persons or circumstances.\\nin hastily forming and giving his opinion of other people,\\nin sacrificing general politeness to the enjoyment\\nof undivided attention where his heart was engaged,\\nand in slighting too easily the forms of worldly propriety,\\nhe displayed a want of caution which elinor could not approve,\\nin spite of all that he and marianne could say in its support.\\n\\nmarianne began now to perceive that the desperation\\nwhich had seized her at sixteen and a half, of ever\\nseeing a man who could satisfy her ideas of perfection,\\nhad been rash and unjustifiable.  willoughby was all\\nthat her fancy had delineated in that unhappy hour\\nand in every brighter period, as capable of attaching her;\\nand his behaviour declared his wishes to be in that respect\\nas earnest, as his abilities were strong.\\n\\nher mother too, in whose mind not one speculative\\nthought of their marriage had been raised, by his prospect\\nof riches, was led before the end of a week to hope and\\nexpect it; and secretly to congratulate herself on having\\ngained two such sons-in-law as edward and willoughby.\\n\\ncolonel brandon\\'s partiality for marianne, which had\\nso early been discovered by his friends, now first became\\nperceptible to elinor, when it ceased to be noticed\\nby them.  their attention and wit were drawn off to his\\nmore fortunate rival; and the raillery which the other\\nhad incurred before any partiality arose, was removed\\nwhen his feelings began really to call for the ridicule\\nso justly annexed to sensibility.  elinor was obliged,\\nthough unwillingly, to believe that the sentiments which\\nmrs. jennings had assigned him for her own satisfaction,\\nwere now actually excited by her sister; and that however\\na general resemblance of disposition between the parties\\nmight forward the affection of mr. willoughby, an equally\\nstriking opposition of character was no hindrance to the\\nregard of colonel brandon.  she saw it with concern;\\nfor what could a silent man of five and thirty hope,\\nwhen opposed to a very lively one of five and twenty? and as\\nshe could not even wish him successful, she heartily wished\\nhim indifferent.  she liked him--in spite of his gravity\\nand reserve, she beheld in him an object of interest.\\nhis manners, though serious, were mild; and his reserve\\nappeared rather the result of some oppression of spirits\\nthan of any natural gloominess of temper.  sir john\\nhad dropped hints of past injuries and disappointments,\\nwhich justified her belief of his being an unfortunate man,\\nand she regarded him with respect and compassion.\\n\\nperhaps she pitied and esteemed him the more\\nbecause he was slighted by willoughby and marianne,\\nwho, prejudiced against him for being neither lively\\nnor young, seemed resolved to undervalue his merits.\\n\\n\"brandon is just the kind of man,\" said willoughby\\none day, when they were talking of him together,\\n\"whom every body speaks well of, and nobody cares about;\\nwhom all are delighted to see, and nobody remembers\\nto talk to.\"\\n\\n\"that is exactly what i think of him,\" cried marianne.\\n\\n\"do not boast of it, however,\" said elinor, \"for it\\nis injustice in both of you.  he is highly esteemed\\nby all the family at the park, and i never see him myself\\nwithout taking pains to converse with him.\"\\n\\n\"that he is patronised by you,\" replied willoughby,\\n\"is certainly in his favour; but as for the esteem\\nof the others, it is a reproach in itself.  who would\\nsubmit to the indignity of being approved by such a woman\\nas lady middleton and mrs. jennings, that could command\\nthe indifference of any body else?\"\\n\\n\"but perhaps the abuse of such people as yourself\\nand marianne will make amends for the regard of lady\\nmiddleton and her mother.  if their praise is censure,\\nyour censure may be praise, for they are not more undiscerning,\\nthan you are prejudiced and unjust.\"\\n\\n\"in defence of your protege you can even be saucy.\"\\n\\n\"my protege, as you call him, is a sensible man;\\nand sense will always have attractions for me.\\nyes, marianne, even in a man between thirty and forty.\\nhe has seen a great deal of the world; has been abroad,\\nhas read, and has a thinking mind.  i have found him\\ncapable of giving me much information on various subjects;\\nand he has always answered my inquiries with readiness of\\ngood-breeding and good nature.\"\\n\\n\"that is to say,\" cried marianne contemptuously,\\n\"he has told you, that in the east indies the climate is hot,\\nand the mosquitoes are troublesome.\"\\n\\n\"he would have told me so, i doubt not, had i made\\nany such inquiries, but they happened to be points\\non which i had been previously informed.\"\\n\\n\"perhaps,\" said willoughby, \"his observations may\\nhave extended to the existence of nabobs, gold mohrs,\\nand palanquins.\"\\n\\n\"i may venture to say that his observations\\nhave stretched much further than your candour.\\nbut why should you dislike him?\"\\n\\n\"i do not dislike him.  i consider him, on the contrary,\\nas a very respectable man, who has every body\\'s good word,\\nand nobody\\'s notice; who, has more money than he can spend,\\nmore time than he knows how to employ, and two new coats\\nevery year.\"\\n\\n\"add to which,\" cried marianne, \"that he has\\nneither genius, taste, nor spirit.  that his understanding\\nhas no brilliancy, his feelings no ardour, and his voice\\nno expression.\"\\n\\n\"you decide on his imperfections so much in the mass,\"\\nreplied elinor, \"and so much on the strength of your\\nown imagination, that the commendation i am able to give\\nof him is comparatively cold and insipid.  i can only\\npronounce him to be a sensible man, well-bred, well-informed,\\nof gentle address, and, i believe, possessing an amiable heart.\"\\n\\n\"miss dashwood,\" cried willoughby, \"you are now using\\nme unkindly.  you are endeavouring to disarm me by reason,\\nand to convince me against my will.  but it will not do.\\nyou shall find me as stubborn as you can be artful.  i have\\nthree unanswerable reasons for disliking colonel brandon;\\nhe threatened me with rain when i wanted it to be fine;\\nhe has found fault with the hanging of my curricle,\\nand i cannot persuade him to buy my brown mare.  if it\\nwill be any satisfaction to you, however, to be told,\\nthat i believe his character to be in other respects\\nirreproachable, i am ready to confess it.  and in return\\nfor an acknowledgment, which must give me some pain,\\nyou cannot deny me the privilege of disliking him as much\\nas ever.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 11\\n\\n\\nlittle had mrs. dashwood or her daughters imagined\\nwhen they first came into devonshire, that so many\\nengagements would arise to occupy their time as shortly\\npresented themselves, or that they should have such frequent\\ninvitations and such constant visitors as to leave them little\\nleisure for serious employment.  yet such was the case.\\nwhen marianne was recovered, the schemes of amusement at home\\nand abroad, which sir john had been previously forming,\\nwere put into execution.  the private balls at the park\\nthen began; and parties on the water were made and\\naccomplished as often as a showery october would allow.\\nin every meeting of the kind willoughby was included;\\nand the ease and familiarity which naturally attended\\nthese parties were exactly calculated to give increasing\\nintimacy to his acquaintance with the dashwoods, to afford\\nhim opportunity of witnessing the excellencies of marianne,\\nof marking his animated admiration of her, and of receiving,\\nin her behaviour to himself, the most pointed assurance\\nof her affection.\\n\\nelinor could not be surprised at their attachment.\\nshe only wished that it were less openly shewn; and once\\nor twice did venture to suggest the propriety of some\\nself-command to marianne.  but marianne abhorred all\\nconcealment where no real disgrace could attend unreserve;\\nand to aim at the restraint of sentiments which were not\\nin themselves illaudable, appeared to her not merely\\nan unnecessary effort, but a disgraceful subjection\\nof reason to common-place and mistaken notions.\\nwilloughby thought the same; and their behaviour at\\nall times, was an illustration of their opinions.\\n\\nwhen he was present she had no eyes for any one else.\\nevery thing he did, was right.  every thing he said, was clever.\\nif their evenings at the park were concluded with cards,\\nhe cheated himself and all the rest of the party to get\\nher a good hand.  if dancing formed the amusement\\nof the night, they were partners for half the time;\\nand when obliged to separate for a couple of dances,\\nwere careful to stand together and scarcely spoke a word\\nto any body else.  such conduct made them of course\\nmost exceedingly laughed at; but ridicule could not shame,\\nand seemed hardly to provoke them.\\n\\nmrs. dashwood entered into all their feelings with\\na warmth which left her no inclination for checking this\\nexcessive display of them.  to her it was but the natural\\nconsequence of a strong affection in a young and ardent mind.\\n\\nthis was the season of happiness to marianne.\\nher heart was devoted to willoughby, and the fond attachment\\nto norland, which she brought with her from sussex,\\nwas more likely to be softened than she had thought it\\npossible before, by the charms which his society bestowed\\non her present home.\\n\\nelinor\\'s happiness was not so great.  her heart was not\\nso much at ease, nor her satisfaction in their amusements\\nso pure.  they afforded her no companion that could make\\namends for what she had left behind, nor that could teach\\nher to think of norland with less regret than ever.\\nneither lady middleton nor mrs. jennings could supply\\nto her the conversation she missed; although the latter\\nwas an everlasting talker, and from the first had regarded\\nher with a kindness which ensured her a large share of\\nher discourse.  she had already repeated her own history\\nto elinor three or four times; and had elinor\\'s memory been\\nequal to her means of improvement, she might have known\\nvery early in their acquaintance all the particulars of\\nmr. jenning\\'s last illness, and what he said to his wife\\na few minutes before he died.  lady middleton was more\\nagreeable than her mother only in being more silent.\\nelinor needed little observation to perceive that her\\nreserve was a mere calmness of manner with which sense\\nhad nothing to do.  towards her husband and mother she\\nwas the same as to them; and intimacy was therefore\\nneither to be looked for nor desired.  she had nothing\\nto say one day that she had not said the day before.\\nher insipidity was invariable, for even her spirits were\\nalways the same; and though she did not oppose the parties\\narranged by her husband, provided every thing were conducted\\nin style and her two eldest children attended her,\\nshe never appeared to receive more enjoyment from them\\nthan she might have experienced in sitting at home;--\\nand so little did her presence add to the pleasure\\nof the others, by any share in their conversation,\\nthat they were sometimes only reminded of her being\\namongst them by her solicitude about her troublesome boys.\\n\\nin colonel brandon alone, of all her new acquaintance,\\ndid elinor find a person who could in any degree claim the\\nrespect of abilities, excite the interest of friendship,\\nor give pleasure as a companion.  willoughby was out\\nof the question.  her admiration and regard, even her\\nsisterly regard, was all his own; but he was a lover;\\nhis attentions were wholly marianne\\'s, and a far less\\nagreeable man might have been more generally pleasing.\\ncolonel brandon, unfortunately for himself, had no such\\nencouragement to think only of marianne, and in conversing\\nwith elinor he found the greatest consolation for the\\nindifference of her sister.\\n\\nelinor\\'s compassion for him increased, as she had reason\\nto suspect that the misery of disappointed love had already\\nbeen known to him.  this suspicion was given by some words\\nwhich accidently dropped from him one evening at the park,\\nwhen they were sitting down together by mutual consent,\\nwhile the others were dancing.  his eyes were fixed\\non marianne, and, after a silence of some minutes,\\nhe said, with a faint smile, \"your sister, i understand,\\ndoes not approve of second attachments.\"\\n\\n\"no,\" replied elinor, \"her opinions are all romantic.\"\\n\\n\"or rather, as i believe, she considers them\\nimpossible to exist.\"\\n\\n\"i believe she does.  but how she contrives it\\nwithout reflecting on the character of her own father,\\nwho had himself two wives, i know not.  a few years\\nhowever will settle her opinions on the reasonable basis\\nof common sense and observation; and then they may be\\nmore easy to define and to justify than they now are,\\nby any body but herself.\"\\n\\n\"this will probably be the case,\" he replied;\\n\"and yet there is something so amiable in the prejudices\\nof a young mind, that one is sorry to see them give way\\nto the reception of more general opinions.\"\\n\\n\"i cannot agree with you there,\" said elinor.\\n\"there are inconveniences attending such feelings\\nas marianne\\'s, which all the charms of enthusiasm and\\nignorance of the world cannot atone for.  her systems have\\nall the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at nought;\\nand a better acquaintance with the world is what i look\\nforward to as her greatest possible advantage.\"\\n\\nafter a short pause he resumed the conversation\\nby saying,--\\n\\n\"does your sister make no distinction in her objections\\nagainst a second attachment? or is it equally criminal\\nin every body?  are those who have been disappointed\\nin their first choice, whether from the inconstancy\\nof its object, or the perverseness of circumstances,\\nto be equally indifferent during the rest of their lives?\"\\n\\n\"upon my word, i am not acquainted with the minutiae\\nof her principles.  i only know that i never yet heard her\\nadmit any instance of a second attachment\\'s being pardonable.\"\\n\\n\"this,\" said he, \"cannot hold; but a change,\\na total change of sentiments--no, no, do not desire it;\\nfor when the romantic refinements of a young mind\\nare obliged to give way, how frequently are they\\nsucceeded by such opinions as are but too common, and too\\ndangerous!  i speak from experience.  i once knew a lady\\nwho in temper and mind greatly resembled your sister,\\nwho thought and judged like her, but who from an inforced\\nchange--from a series of unfortunate circumstances\"--\\nhere he stopt suddenly; appeared to think that he had said\\ntoo much, and by his countenance gave rise to conjectures,\\nwhich might not otherwise have entered elinor\\'s head.\\nthe lady would probably have passed without suspicion,\\nhad he not convinced miss dashwood that what concerned\\nher ought not to escape his lips.  as it was,\\nit required but a slight effort of fancy to connect his\\nemotion with the tender recollection of past regard.\\nelinor attempted no more.  but marianne, in her place,\\nwould not have done so little.  the whole story would\\nhave been speedily formed under her active imagination;\\nand every thing established in the most melancholy order\\nof disastrous love.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 12\\n\\n\\nas elinor and marianne were walking together the\\nnext morning the latter communicated a piece of news\\nto her sister, which in spite of all that she knew\\nbefore of marianne\\'s imprudence and want of thought,\\nsurprised her by its extravagant testimony of both.\\nmarianne told her, with the greatest delight, that\\nwilloughby had given her a horse, one that he had bred\\nhimself on his estate in somersetshire, and which was\\nexactly calculated to carry a woman.  without considering\\nthat it was not in her mother\\'s plan to keep any horse,\\nthat if she were to alter her resolution in favour of\\nthis gift, she must buy another for the servant, and\\nkeep a servant to ride it, and after all, build a stable\\nto receive them, she had accepted the present without\\nhesitation, and told her sister of it in raptures.\\n\\n\"he intends to send his groom into somersetshire\\nimmediately for it,\" she added, \"and when it arrives we\\nwill ride every day.  you shall share its use with me.\\nimagine to yourself, my dear elinor, the delight of a gallop\\non some of these downs.\"\\n\\nmost unwilling was she to awaken from such a dream of\\nfelicity to comprehend all the unhappy truths which attended\\nthe affair; and for some time she refused to submit to them.\\nas to an additional servant, the expense would be a trifle;\\nmamma she was sure would never object to it; and any horse\\nwould do for him; he might always get one at the park;\\nas to a stable, the merest shed would be sufficient.\\nelinor then ventured to doubt the propriety of her receiving\\nsuch a present from a man so little, or at least so lately\\nknown to her.  this was too much.\\n\\n\"you are mistaken, elinor,\" said she warmly,\\n\"in supposing i know very little of willoughby.\\ni have not known him long indeed, but i am much better\\nacquainted with him, than i am with any other creature\\nin the world, except yourself and mama.  it is not\\ntime or opportunity that is to determine intimacy;--\\nit is disposition alone.  seven years would be insufficient\\nto make some people acquainted with each other, and seven\\ndays are more than enough for others.  i should hold\\nmyself guilty of greater impropriety in accepting a horse\\nfrom my brother, than from willoughby.  of john i know\\nvery little, though we have lived together for years;\\nbut of willoughby my judgment has long been formed.\"\\n\\nelinor thought it wisest to touch that point no more.\\nshe knew her sister\\'s temper.  opposition on so tender a\\nsubject would only attach her the more to her own opinion.\\nbut by an appeal to her affection for her mother,\\nby representing the inconveniences which that indulgent\\nmother must draw on herself, if (as would probably be\\nthe case) she consented to this increase of establishment,\\nmarianne was shortly subdued; and she promised not to\\ntempt her mother to such imprudent kindness by mentioning\\nthe offer, and to tell willoughby when she saw him next,\\nthat it must be declined.\\n\\nshe was faithful to her word; and when willoughby\\ncalled at the cottage, the same day, elinor heard her\\nexpress her disappointment to him in a low voice, on\\nbeing obliged to forego the acceptance of his present.\\nthe reasons for this alteration were at the same time related,\\nand they were such as to make further entreaty on his\\nside impossible.  his concern however was very apparent;\\nand after expressing it with earnestness, he added,\\nin the same low voice,--\"but, marianne, the horse is\\nstill yours, though you cannot use it now.  i shall keep\\nit only till you can claim it.  when you leave barton\\nto form your own establishment in a more lasting home,\\nqueen mab shall receive you.\"\\n\\nthis was all overheard by miss dashwood; and in the\\nwhole of the sentence, in his manner of pronouncing it,\\nand in his addressing her sister by her christian name alone,\\nshe instantly saw an intimacy so decided, a meaning\\nso direct, as marked a perfect agreement between them.\\nfrom that moment she doubted not of their being engaged\\nto each other; and the belief of it created no other surprise\\nthan that she, or any of their friends, should be left\\nby tempers so frank, to discover it by accident.\\n\\nmargaret related something to her the next day,\\nwhich placed this matter in a still clearer light.\\nwilloughby had spent the preceding evening with them,\\nand margaret, by being left some time in the parlour\\nwith only him and marianne, had had opportunity\\nfor observations, which, with a most important face,\\nshe communicated to her eldest sister, when they were\\nnext by themselves.\\n\\n\"oh, elinor!\" she cried, \"i have such a secret to\\ntell you about marianne.  i am sure she will be married\\nto mr. willoughby very soon.\"\\n\\n\"you have said so,\" replied elinor, \"almost every\\nday since they first met on high-church down; and they\\nhad not known each other a week, i believe, before you\\nwere certain that marianne wore his picture round her neck;\\nbut it turned out to be only the miniature of our great uncle.\"\\n\\n\"but indeed this is quite another thing.  i am sure\\nthey will be married very soon, for he has got a lock\\nof her hair.\"\\n\\n\"take care, margaret.  it may be only the hair\\nof some great uncle of his.\"\\n\\n\"but, indeed, elinor, it is marianne\\'s. i am almost\\nsure it is, for i saw him cut it off.  last night\\nafter tea, when you and mama went out of the room,\\nthey were whispering and talking together as fast as\\ncould be, and he seemed to be begging something of her,\\nand presently he took up her scissors and cut off a long\\nlock of her hair, for it was all tumbled down her back;\\nand he kissed it, and folded it up in a piece of white paper;\\nand put it into his pocket-book.\"\\n\\nfor such particulars, stated on such authority,\\nelinor could not withhold her credit; nor was she disposed\\nto it, for the circumstance was in perfect unison with\\nwhat she had heard and seen herself.\\n\\nmargaret\\'s sagacity was not always displayed in a\\nway so satisfactory to her sister.  when mrs. jennings\\nattacked her one evening at the park, to give the name\\nof the young man who was elinor\\'s particular favourite,\\nwhich had been long a matter of great curiosity to her,\\nmargaret answered by looking at her sister, and saying,\\n\"i must not tell, may i, elinor?\"\\n\\nthis of course made every body laugh; and elinor\\ntried to laugh too.  but the effort was painful.\\nshe was convinced that margaret had fixed on a person\\nwhose name she could not bear with composure to become\\na standing joke with mrs. jennings.\\n\\nmarianne felt for her most sincerely; but she did\\nmore harm than good to the cause, by turning very red\\nand saying in an angry manner to margaret,\\n\\n\"remember that whatever your conjectures may be,\\nyou have no right to repeat them.\"\\n\\n\"i never had any conjectures about it,\" replied margaret;\\n\"it was you who told me of it yourself.\"\\n\\nthis increased the mirth of the company, and margaret\\nwas eagerly pressed to say something more.\\n\\n\"oh! pray, miss margaret, let us know all about it,\"\\nsaid mrs. jennings.  \"what is the gentleman\\'s name?\"\\n\\n\"i must not tell, ma\\'am. but i know very well what it is;\\nand i know where he is too.\"\\n\\n\"yes, yes, we can guess where he is; at his own house\\nat norland to be sure.  he is the curate of the parish\\ni dare say.\"\\n\\n\"no, that he is not.  he is of no profession at all.\"\\n\\n\"margaret,\" said marianne with great warmth,\\n\"you know that all this is an invention of your own,\\nand that there is no such person in existence.\"\\n\\n\"well, then, he is lately dead, marianne, for i\\nam sure there was such a man once, and his name begins\\nwith an f.\"\\n\\nmost grateful did elinor feel to lady middleton\\nfor observing, at this moment, \"that it rained very hard,\"\\nthough she believed the interruption to proceed less from\\nany attention to her, than from her ladyship\\'s great dislike\\nof all such inelegant subjects of raillery as delighted\\nher husband and mother.  the idea however started by her,\\nwas immediately pursued by colonel brandon, who was\\non every occasion mindful of the feelings of others;\\nand much was said on the subject of rain by both of them.\\nwilloughby opened the piano-forte, and asked marianne\\nto sit down to it; and thus amidst the various endeavours\\nof different people to quit the topic, it fell to the ground.\\nbut not so easily did elinor recover from the alarm into\\nwhich it had thrown her.\\n\\na party was formed this evening for going on the\\nfollowing day to see a very fine place about twelve miles\\nfrom barton, belonging to a brother-in-law of colonel brandon,\\nwithout whose interest it could not be seen, as the proprietor,\\nwho was then abroad, had left strict orders on that head.\\nthe grounds were declared to be highly beautiful,\\nand sir john, who was particularly warm in their praise,\\nmight be allowed to be a tolerable judge, for he had\\nformed parties to visit them, at least, twice every summer\\nfor the last ten years.  they contained a noble piece\\nof water; a sail on which was to a form a great part of\\nthe morning\\'s amusement; cold provisions were to be taken,\\nopen carriages only to be employed, and every thing\\nconducted in the usual style of a complete party of pleasure.\\n\\nto some few of the company it appeared rather\\na bold undertaking, considering the time of year,\\nand that it had rained every day for the last fortnight;--\\nand mrs. dashwood, who had already a cold, was persuaded\\nby elinor to stay at home.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 13\\n\\n\\ntheir intended excursion to whitwell turned out\\nvery different from what elinor had expected.  she was\\nprepared to be wet through, fatigued, and frightened;\\nbut the event was still more unfortunate, for they did\\nnot go at all.\\n\\nby ten o\\'clock the whole party was assembled at\\nthe park, where they were to breakfast.  the morning\\nwas rather favourable, though it had rained all night,\\nas the clouds were then dispersing across the sky,\\nand the sun frequently appeared.  they were all in high\\nspirits and good humour, eager to be happy, and determined\\nto submit to the greatest inconveniences and hardships\\nrather than be otherwise.\\n\\nwhile they were at breakfast the letters were brought in.\\namong the rest there was one for colonel brandon;--he\\ntook it, looked at the direction, changed colour,\\nand immediately left the room.\\n\\n\"what is the matter with brandon?\" said sir john.\\n\\nnobody could tell.\\n\\n\"i hope he has had no bad news,\" said lady middleton.\\n\"it must be something extraordinary that could make colonel\\nbrandon leave my breakfast table so suddenly.\"\\n\\nin about five minutes he returned.\\n\\n\"no bad news, colonel, i hope;\" said mrs. jennings,\\nas soon as he entered the room.\\n\\n\"none at all, ma\\'am, i thank you.\"\\n\\n\"was it from avignon?  i hope it is not to say\\nthat your sister is worse.\"\\n\\n\"no, ma\\'am. it came from town, and is merely\\na letter of business.\"\\n\\n\"but how came the hand to discompose you so much,\\nif it was only a letter of business?  come, come,\\nthis won\\'t do, colonel; so let us hear the truth of it.\"\\n\\n\"my dear madam,\" said lady middleton, \"recollect what\\nyou are saying.\"\\n\\n\"perhaps it is to tell you that your cousin fanny\\nis married?\" said mrs. jennings, without attending\\nto her daughter\\'s reproof.\\n\\n\"no, indeed, it is not.\"\\n\\n\"well, then, i know who it is from, colonel.  and i\\nhope she is well.\"\\n\\n\"whom do you mean, ma\\'am?\" said he, colouring a little.\\n\\n\"oh! you know who i mean.\"\\n\\n\"i am particularly sorry, ma\\'am,\" said he,\\naddressing lady middleton, \"that i should receive this\\nletter today, for it is on business which requires\\nmy immediate attendance in town.\"\\n\\n\"in town!\" cried mrs. jennings.  \"what can you\\nhave to do in town at this time of year?\"\\n\\n\"my own loss is great,\" be continued, \"in being obliged\\nto leave so agreeable a party; but i am the more concerned,\\nas i fear my presence is necessary to gain your admittance\\nat whitwell.\"\\n\\nwhat a blow upon them all was this!\\n\\n\"but if you write a note to the housekeeper, mr. brandon,\"\\nsaid marianne, eagerly, \"will it not be sufficient?\"\\n\\nhe shook his head.\\n\\n\"we must go,\" said sir john.--\"it shall not be put\\noff when we are so near it.  you cannot go to town till\\ntomorrow, brandon, that is all.\"\\n\\n\"i wish it could be so easily settled.  but it\\nis not in my power to delay my journey for one day!\"\\n\\n\"if you would but let us know what your business is,\"\\nsaid mrs. jennings, \"we might see whether it could be put\\noff or not.\"\\n\\n\"you would not be six hours later,\" said willoughby,\\n\"if you were to defer your journey till our return.\"\\n\\n\"i cannot afford to lose one hour.\"--\\n\\nelinor then heard willoughby say, in a low voice to marianne,\\n\"there are some people who cannot bear a party of pleasure.\\nbrandon is one of them.  he was afraid of catching cold\\ni dare say, and invented this trick for getting out of it.\\ni would lay fifty guineas the letter was of his own writing.\"\\n\\n\"i have no doubt of it,\" replied marianne.\\n\\n\"there is no persuading you to change your mind,\\nbrandon, i know of old,\" said sir john, \"when once you\\nare determined on anything.  but, however, i hope you\\nwill think better of it.  consider, here are the two miss\\ncareys come over from newton, the three miss dashwoods\\nwalked up from the cottage, and mr. willoughby got up\\ntwo hours before his usual time, on purpose to go to whitwell.\"\\n\\ncolonel brandon again repeated his sorrow at being\\nthe cause of disappointing the party; but at the same\\ntime declared it to be unavoidable.\\n\\n\"well, then, when will you come back again?\"\\n\\n\"i hope we shall see you at barton,\" added her ladyship,\\n\"as soon as you can conveniently leave town; and we must\\nput off the party to whitwell till you return.\"\\n\\n\"you are very obliging.  but it is so uncertain,\\nwhen i may have it in my power to return, that i dare\\nnot engage for it at all.\"\\n\\n\"oh! he must and shall come back,\" cried sir john.\\n\"if he is not here by the end of the week, i shall go\\nafter him.\"\\n\\n\"ay, so do, sir john,\" cried mrs. jennings, \"and then\\nperhaps you may find out what his business is.\"\\n\\n\"i do not want to pry into other men\\'s concerns.\\ni suppose it is something he is ashamed of.\"\\n\\ncolonel brandon\\'s horses were announced.\\n\\n\"you do not go to town on horseback, do you?\"\\nadded sir john.\\n\\n\"no. only to honiton.  i shall then go post.\"\\n\\n\"well, as you are resolved to go, i wish you\\na good journey.  but you had better change your mind.\"\\n\\n\"i assure you it is not in my power.\"\\n\\nhe then took leave of the whole party.\\n\\n\"is there no chance of my seeing you and your sisters\\nin town this winter, miss dashwood?\"\\n\\n\"i am afraid, none at all.\"\\n\\n\"then i must bid you farewell for a longer time\\nthan i should wish to do.\"\\n\\nto marianne, he merely bowed and said nothing.\\n\\n\"come colonel,\" said mrs. jennings, \"before you go,\\ndo let us know what you are going about.\"\\n\\nhe wished her a good morning, and, attended by sir john,\\nleft the room.\\n\\nthe complaints and lamentations which politeness\\nhad hitherto restrained, now burst forth universally;\\nand they all agreed again and again how provoking it was\\nto be so disappointed.\\n\\n\"i can guess what his business is, however,\"\\nsaid mrs. jennings exultingly.\\n\\n\"can you, ma\\'am?\" said almost every body.\\n\\n\"yes; it is about miss williams, i am sure.\"\\n\\n\"and who is miss williams?\" asked marianne.\\n\\n\"what! do not you know who miss williams is? i am\\nsure you must have heard of her before.  she is a relation\\nof the colonel\\'s, my dear; a very near relation.  we will\\nnot say how near, for fear of shocking the young ladies.\"\\nthen, lowering her voice a little, she said to elinor,\\n\"she is his natural daughter.\"\\n\\n\"indeed!\"\\n\\n\"oh, yes; and as like him as she can stare.\\ni dare say the colonel will leave her all his fortune.\"\\n\\nwhen sir john returned, he joined most heartily\\nin the general regret on so unfortunate an event;\\nconcluding however by observing, that as they were\\nall got together, they must do something by way of\\nbeing happy; and after some consultation it was agreed,\\nthat although happiness could only be enjoyed at whitwell,\\nthey might procure a tolerable composure of mind by driving\\nabout the country.  the carriages were then ordered;\\nwilloughby\\'s was first, and marianne never looked\\nhappier than when she got into it.  he drove through\\nthe park very fast, and they were soon out of sight;\\nand nothing more of them was seen till their return,\\nwhich did not happen till after the return of all the rest.\\nthey both seemed delighted with their drive; but said\\nonly in general terms that they had kept in the lanes,\\nwhile the others went on the downs.\\n\\nit was settled that there should be a dance in the evening,\\nand that every body should be extremely merry all day long.\\nsome more of the careys came to dinner, and they had the\\npleasure of sitting down nearly twenty to table, which sir\\njohn observed with great contentment.  willoughby took\\nhis usual place between the two elder miss dashwoods.\\nmrs. jennings sat on elinor\\'s right hand; and they had not\\nbeen long seated, before she leant behind her and willoughby,\\nand said to marianne, loud enough for them both to hear,\\n\"i have found you out in spite of all your tricks.\\ni know where you spent the morning.\"\\n\\nmarianne coloured, and replied very hastily,\\n\"where, pray?\"--\\n\\n\"did not you know,\" said willoughby, \"that we had\\nbeen out in my curricle?\"\\n\\n\"yes, yes, mr. impudence, i know that very well,\\nand i was determined to find out where you had been to.--\\ni hope you like your house, miss marianne.  it is a very\\nlarge one, i know; and when i come to see you, i hope you\\nwill have new-furnished it, for it wanted it very much\\nwhen i was there six years ago.\"\\n\\nmarianne turned away in great confusion.\\nmrs. jennings laughed heartily; and elinor found that in her\\nresolution to know where they had been, she had actually\\nmade her own woman enquire of mr. willoughby\\'s groom;\\nand that she had by that method been informed that they\\nhad gone to allenham, and spent a considerable time there\\nin walking about the garden and going all over the house.\\n\\nelinor could hardly believe this to be true,\\nas it seemed very unlikely that willoughby should propose,\\nor marianne consent, to enter the house while mrs. smith was\\nin it, with whom marianne had not the smallest acquaintance.\\n\\nas soon as they left the dining-room, elinor enquired\\nof her about it; and great was her surprise when she\\nfound that every circumstance related by mrs. jennings\\nwas perfectly true.  marianne was quite angry with her\\nfor doubting it.\\n\\n\"why should you imagine, elinor, that we did not\\ngo there, or that we did not see the house?  is not it\\nwhat you have often wished to do yourself?\"\\n\\n\"yes, marianne, but i would not go while mrs. smith\\nwas there, and with no other companion than mr. willoughby.\"\\n\\n\"mr. willoughby however is the only person who can\\nhave a right to shew that house; and as he went in an open\\ncarriage, it was impossible to have any other companion.\\ni never spent a pleasanter morning in my life.\"\\n\\n\"i am afraid,\" replied elinor, \"that the pleasantness\\nof an employment does not always evince its propriety.\"\\n\\n\"on the contrary, nothing can be a stronger proof\\nof it, elinor; for if there had been any real impropriety\\nin what i did, i should have been sensible of it at\\nthe time, for we always know when we are acting wrong,\\nand with such a conviction i could have had no pleasure.\"\\n\\n\"but, my dear marianne, as it has already exposed you\\nto some very impertinent remarks, do you not now begin\\nto doubt the discretion of your own conduct?\"\\n\\n\"if the impertinent remarks of mrs. jennings are\\nto be the proof of impropriety in conduct, we are all\\noffending every moment of our lives.  i value not her\\ncensure any more than i should do her commendation.\\ni am not sensible of having done anything wrong in walking\\nover mrs. smith\\'s grounds, or in seeing her house.\\nthey will one day be mr. willoughby\\'s, and--\"\\n\\n\"if they were one day to be your own, marianne,\\nyou would not be justified in what you have done.\"\\n\\nshe blushed at this hint; but it was even visibly\\ngratifying to her; and after a ten minutes\\' interval of\\nearnest thought, she came to her sister again, and said\\nwith great good humour, \"perhaps, elinor, it was rather\\nill-judged in me to go to allenham; but mr. willoughby wanted\\nparticularly to shew me the place; and it is a charming house,\\ni assure you.--there is one remarkably pretty sitting room\\nup stairs; of a nice comfortable size for constant use,\\nand with modern furniture it would be delightful.\\nit is a corner room, and has windows on two sides.\\non one side you look across the bowling-green, behind\\nthe house, to a beautiful hanging wood, and on the other you\\nhave a view of the church and village, and, beyond them,\\nof those fine bold hills that we have so often admired.\\ni did not see it to advantage, for nothing could be\\nmore forlorn than the furniture,--but if it were newly\\nfitted up--a couple of hundred pounds, willoughby says,\\nwould make it one of the pleasantest summer-rooms\\nin england.\"\\n\\ncould elinor have listened to her without interruption\\nfrom the others, she would have described every room\\nin the house with equal delight.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 14\\n\\n\\nthe sudden termination of colonel brandon\\'s visit\\nat the park, with his steadiness in concealing its cause,\\nfilled the mind, and raised the wonder of mrs. jennings\\nfor two or three days; she was a great wonderer, as every\\none must be who takes a very lively interest in all the\\ncomings and goings of all their acquaintance.  she wondered,\\nwith little intermission what could be the reason of it;\\nwas sure there must be some bad news, and thought over\\nevery kind of distress that could have befallen him,\\nwith a fixed determination that he should not escape\\nthem all.\\n\\n\"something very melancholy must be the matter,\\ni am sure,\" said she.  \"i could see it in his face.\\npoor man!  i am afraid his circumstances may be bad.\\nthe estate at delaford was never reckoned more than two thousand\\na year, and his brother left everything sadly involved.\\ni do think he must have been sent for about money matters,\\nfor what else can it be?  i wonder whether it is so.\\ni would give anything to know the truth of it.  perhaps it\\nis about miss williams and, by the bye, i dare say it is,\\nbecause he looked so conscious when i mentioned her.\\nmay be she is ill in town; nothing in the world more likely,\\nfor i have a notion she is always rather sickly.\\ni would lay any wager it is about miss williams.\\nit is not so very likely he should be distressed in\\nhis circumstances now, for he is a very prudent man,\\nand to be sure must have cleared the estate by this time.\\ni wonder what it can be!  may be his sister is worse\\nat avignon, and has sent for him over.  his setting off\\nin such a hurry seems very like it.  well, i wish him out\\nof all his trouble with all my heart, and a good wife into\\nthe bargain.\"\\n\\nso wondered, so talked mrs. jennings.  her opinion\\nvarying with every fresh conjecture, and all seeming\\nequally probable as they arose.  elinor, though she felt\\nreally interested in the welfare of colonel brandon,\\ncould not bestow all the wonder on his going so suddenly\\naway, which mrs. jennings was desirous of her feeling;\\nfor besides that the circumstance did not in her opinion\\njustify such lasting amazement or variety of speculation,\\nher wonder was otherwise disposed of.  it was engrossed\\nby the extraordinary silence of her sister and willoughby\\non the subject, which they must know to be peculiarly\\ninteresting to them all.  as this silence continued,\\nevery day made it appear more strange and more incompatible\\nwith the disposition of both.  why they should not openly\\nacknowledge to her mother and herself, what their constant\\nbehaviour to each other declared to have taken place,\\nelinor could not imagine.\\n\\nshe could easily conceive that marriage might not\\nbe immediately in their power; for though willoughby\\nwas independent, there was no reason to believe him rich.\\nhis estate had been rated by sir john at about six or seven\\nhundred a year; but he lived at an expense to which that income\\ncould hardly be equal, and he had himself often complained\\nof his poverty.  but for this strange kind of secrecy\\nmaintained by them relative to their engagement, which\\nin fact concealed nothing at all, she could not account;\\nand it was so wholly contradictory to their general\\nopinions and practice, that a doubt sometimes entered\\nher mind of their being really engaged, and this doubt\\nwas enough to prevent her making any inquiry of marianne.\\n\\nnothing could be more expressive of attachment\\nto them all, than willoughby\\'s behaviour.  to marianne\\nit had all the distinguishing tenderness which a lover\\'s\\nheart could give, and to the rest of the family it was the\\naffectionate attention of a son and a brother.  the cottage\\nseemed to be considered and loved by him as his home;\\nmany more of his hours were spent there than at allenham;\\nand if no general engagement collected them at the park,\\nthe exercise which called him out in the morning was\\nalmost certain of ending there, where the rest of the day\\nwas spent by himself at the side of marianne, and by his\\nfavourite pointer at her feet.\\n\\none evening in particular, about a week after\\ncolonel brandon left the country, his heart seemed\\nmore than usually open to every feeling of attachment\\nto the objects around him; and on mrs. dashwood\\'s\\nhappening to mention her design of improving the cottage\\nin the spring, he warmly opposed every alteration\\nof a place which affection had established as perfect with him.\\n\\n\"what!\" he exclaimed--\"improve this dear cottage!\\nno. that i will never consent to.  not a stone must\\nbe added to its walls, not an inch to its size,\\nif my feelings are regarded.\"\\n\\n\"do not be alarmed,\" said miss dashwood,\\n\"nothing of the kind will be done; for my mother\\nwill never have money enough to attempt it.\"\\n\\n\"i am heartily glad of it,\" he cried.  \"may she\\nalways be poor, if she can employ her riches no better.\"\\n\\n\"thank you, willoughby.  but you may be assured that i\\nwould not sacrifice one sentiment of local attachment\\nof yours, or of any one whom i loved, for all the improvements\\nin the world.  depend upon it that whatever unemployed\\nsum may remain, when i make up my accounts in the spring,\\ni would even rather lay it uselessly by than dispose\\nof it in a manner so painful to you.  but are you really\\nso attached to this place as to see no defect in it?\"\\n\\n\"i am,\" said he.  \"to me it is faultless.  nay, more,\\ni consider it as the only form of building in which happiness\\nis attainable, and were i rich enough i would instantly pull\\ncombe down, and build it up again in the exact plan of this\\ncottage.\"\\n\\n\"with dark narrow stairs and a kitchen that smokes,\\ni suppose,\" said elinor.\\n\\n\"yes,\" cried he in the same eager tone, \"with all\\nand every thing belonging to it;--in no one convenience\\nor inconvenience about it, should the least variation\\nbe perceptible.  then, and then only, under such a roof, i\\nmight perhaps be as happy at combe as i have been at barton.\"\\n\\n\"i flatter myself,\" replied elinor, \"that even under\\nthe disadvantage of better rooms and a broader staircase,\\nyou will hereafter find your own house as faultless as you\\nnow do this.\"\\n\\n\"there certainly are circumstances,\" said willoughby,\\n\"which might greatly endear it to me; but this place will\\nalways have one claim of my affection, which no other can\\npossibly share.\"\\n\\nmrs. dashwood looked with pleasure at marianne,\\nwhose fine eyes were fixed so expressively on willoughby,\\nas plainly denoted how well she understood him.\\n\\n\"how often did i wish,\" added he, \"when i was at\\nallenham this time twelvemonth, that barton cottage were\\ninhabited!  i never passed within view of it without admiring\\nits situation, and grieving that no one should live in it.\\nhow little did i then think that the very first news\\ni should hear from mrs. smith, when i next came into\\nthe country, would be that barton cottage was taken: and i\\nfelt an immediate satisfaction and interest in the event,\\nwhich nothing but a kind of prescience of what happiness i\\nshould experience from it, can account for.  must it not have\\nbeen so, marianne?\" speaking to her in a lowered voice.\\nthen continuing his former tone, he said, \"and yet this\\nhouse you would spoil, mrs. dashwood?  you would rob it\\nof its simplicity by imaginary improvement! and this dear\\nparlour in which our acquaintance first began, and in which\\nso many happy hours have been since spent by us together,\\nyou would degrade to the condition of a common entrance,\\nand every body would be eager to pass through the room\\nwhich has hitherto contained within itself more real\\naccommodation and comfort than any other apartment of\\nthe handsomest dimensions in the world could possibly afford.\"\\n\\nmrs. dashwood again assured him that no alteration\\nof the kind should be attempted.\\n\\n\"you are a good woman,\" he warmly replied.\\n\"your promise makes me easy.  extend it a little farther,\\nand it will make me happy.  tell me that not only your\\nhouse will remain the same, but that i shall ever find\\nyou and yours as unchanged as your dwelling; and that you\\nwill always consider me with the kindness which has made\\neverything belonging to you so dear to me.\"\\n\\nthe promise was readily given, and willoughby\\'s\\nbehaviour during the whole of the evening declared\\nat once his affection and happiness.\\n\\n\"shall we see you tomorrow to dinner?\" said mrs. dashwood,\\nwhen he was leaving them.  \"i do not ask you to come in\\nthe morning, for we must walk to the park, to call on lady\\nmiddleton.\"\\n\\nhe engaged to be with them by four o\\'clock.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 15\\n\\n\\nmrs. dashwood\\'s visit to lady middleton took place\\nthe next day, and two of her daughters went with her;\\nbut marianne excused herself from being of the party,\\nunder some trifling pretext of employment; and her mother,\\nwho concluded that a promise had been made by willoughby\\nthe night before of calling on her while they were absent,\\nwas perfectly satisfied with her remaining at home.\\n\\non their return from the park they found willoughby\\'s\\ncurricle and servant in waiting at the cottage,\\nand mrs. dashwood was convinced that her conjecture\\nhad been just.  so far it was all as she had foreseen;\\nbut on entering the house she beheld what no foresight\\nhad taught her to expect.  they were no sooner in the\\npassage than marianne came hastily out of the parlour\\napparently in violent affliction, with her handkerchief\\nat her eyes; and without noticing them ran up stairs.\\nsurprised and alarmed they proceeded directly into the room\\nshe had just quitted, where they found only willoughby,\\nwho was leaning against the mantel-piece with his back\\ntowards them.  he turned round on their coming in,\\nand his countenance shewed that he strongly partook\\nof the emotion which over-powered marianne.\\n\\n\"is anything the matter with her?\" cried mrs. dashwood\\nas she entered--\"is she ill?\"\\n\\n\"i hope not,\" he replied, trying to look cheerful;\\nand with a forced smile presently added, \"it is i who may\\nrather expect to be ill--for i am now suffering under a\\nvery heavy disappointment!\"\\n\\n\"disappointment?\"\\n\\n\"yes, for i am unable to keep my engagement with you.\\nmrs. smith has this morning exercised the privilege\\nof riches upon a poor dependent cousin, by sending me on\\nbusiness to london.  i have just received my dispatches,\\nand taken my farewell of allenham; and by way of exhilaration\\ni am now come to take my farewell of you.\"\\n\\n\"to london!--and are you going this morning?\"\\n\\n\"almost this moment.\"\\n\\n\"this is very unfortunate.  but mrs. smith must\\nbe obliged;--and her business will not detain you from\\nus long i hope.\"\\n\\nhe coloured as he replied, \"you are very kind, but i\\nhave no idea of returning into devonshire immediately.\\nmy visits to mrs. smith are never repeated within\\nthe twelvemonth.\"\\n\\n\"and is mrs. smith your only friend?  is allenham the only\\nhouse in the neighbourhood to which you will be welcome?\\nfor shame, willoughby, can you wait for an invitation here?\"\\n\\nhis colour increased; and with his eyes fixed\\non the ground he only replied, \"you are too good.\"\\n\\nmrs. dashwood looked at elinor with surprise.\\nelinor felt equal amazement.  for a few moments every one\\nwas silent.  mrs. dashwood first spoke.\\n\\n\"i have only to add, my dear willoughby, that at\\nbarton cottage you will always be welcome; for i will not\\npress you to return here immediately, because you only\\ncan judge how far that might be pleasing to mrs. smith;\\nand on this head i shall be no more disposed to question\\nyour judgment than to doubt your inclination.\"\\n\\n\"my engagements at present,\" replied willoughby,\\nconfusedly, \"are of such a nature--that--i dare not flatter\\nmyself\"--\\n\\nhe stopt.  mrs. dashwood was too much astonished\\nto speak, and another pause succeeded.  this was broken\\nby willoughby, who said with a faint smile, \"it is folly\\nto linger in this manner.  i will not torment myself\\nany longer by remaining among friends whose society\\nit is impossible for me now to enjoy.\"\\n\\nhe then hastily took leave of them all and left\\nthe room.  they saw him step into his carriage,\\nand in a minute it was out of sight.\\n\\nmrs. dashwood felt too much for speech, and instantly\\nquitted the parlour to give way in solitude to the concern\\nand alarm which this sudden departure occasioned.\\n\\nelinor\\'s uneasiness was at least equal to her mother\\'s.\\nshe thought of what had just passed with anxiety and distrust.\\nwilloughby\\'s behaviour in taking leave of them, his\\nembarrassment,\\nand affectation of cheerfulness, and, above all, his\\nunwillingness\\nto accept her mother\\'s invitation, a backwardness so unlike a\\nlover,\\nso unlike himself, greatly disturbed her.  one moment she feared\\nthat no serious design had ever been formed on his side; and the\\nnext that some unfortunate quarrel had taken place between him\\nand\\nher sister;--the distress in which marianne had quitted the room\\nwas such as a serious quarrel could most reasonably account for,\\nthough when she considered what marianne\\'s love for him was,\\na quarrel seemed almost impossible.\\n\\nbut whatever might be the particulars of their separation,\\nher sister\\'s affliction was indubitable; and she thought\\nwith the tenderest compassion of that violent sorrow\\nwhich marianne was in all probability not merely giving\\nway to as a relief, but feeding and encouraging as a duty.\\n\\nin about half an hour her mother returned, and though\\nher eyes were red, her countenance was not uncheerful.\\n\\n\"our dear willoughby is now some miles from barton, elinor,\"\\nsaid she, as she sat down to work, \"and with how heavy a heart\\ndoes he travel?\"\\n\\n\"it is all very strange.  so suddenly to be gone! it\\nseems but the work of a moment.  and last night he was\\nwith us so happy, so cheerful, so affectionate?  and now,\\nafter only ten minutes notice--gone too without intending\\nto return!--something more than what be owned to us must\\nhave happened.  he did not speak, he did not behave\\nlike himself.  you must have seen the difference as well as i.\\nwhat can it be?  can they have quarrelled?  why else should he\\nhave shewn such unwillingness to accept your invitation here?\"--\\n\\n\"it was not inclination that he wanted, elinor; i could\\nplainly see that.  he had not the power of accepting it.\\ni have thought it all over i assure you, and i can\\nperfectly account for every thing that at first seemed\\nstrange to me as well as to you.\"\\n\\n\"can you, indeed!\"\\n\\n\"yes. i have explained it to myself in the most\\nsatisfactory way;--but you, elinor, who love to doubt\\nwhere you can--it will not satisfy you, i know; but you\\nshall not talk me out of my trust in it.  i am persuaded\\nthat mrs. smith suspects his regard for marianne,\\ndisapproves of it, (perhaps because she has other views\\nfor him,) and on that account is eager to get him away;--\\nand that the business which she sends him off to transact\\nis invented as an excuse to dismiss him.  this is what i\\nbelieve to have happened.  he is, moreover, aware that she\\ndoes disapprove the connection, he dares not therefore\\nat present confess to her his engagement with marianne,\\nand he feels himself obliged, from his dependent situation,\\nto give into her schemes, and absent himself from\\ndevonshire for a while.  you will tell me, i know,\\nthat this may or may not have happened; but i will listen\\nto no cavil, unless you can point out any other method\\nof understanding the affair as satisfactory at this.\\nand now, elinor, what have you to say?\"\\n\\n\"nothing, for you have anticipated my answer.\"\\n\\n\"then you would have told me, that it might or might not\\nhave happened.  oh, elinor, how incomprehensible are your\\nfeelings!  you had rather take evil upon credit than good.\\nyou had rather look out for misery for marianne, and guilt\\nfor poor willoughby, than an apology for the latter.\\nyou are resolved to think him blameable, because he took\\nleave of us with less affection than his usual behaviour\\nhas shewn.  and is no allowance to be made for inadvertence,\\nor for spirits depressed by recent disappointment?  are\\nno probabilities to be accepted, merely because they\\nare not certainties?  is nothing due to the man whom we\\nhave all such reason to love, and no reason in the world\\nto think ill of?  to the possibility of motives unanswerable\\nin themselves, though unavoidably secret for a while?  and,\\nafter all, what is it you suspect him of?\"\\n\\n\"i can hardly tell myself.  but suspicion of\\nsomething unpleasant is the inevitable consequence\\nof such an alteration as we just witnessed in him.\\nthere is great truth, however, in what you have now urged\\nof the allowances which ought to be made for him, and it\\nis my wish to be candid in my judgment of every body.\\nwilloughby may undoubtedly have very sufficient\\nreasons for his conduct, and i will hope that he has.\\nbut it would have been more like willoughby to acknowledge\\nthem at once.  secrecy may be advisable; but still i\\ncannot help wondering at its being practiced by him.\"\\n\\n\"do not blame him, however, for departing from\\nhis character, where the deviation is necessary.\\nbut you really do admit the justice of what i have said\\nin his defence?--i am happy--and he is acquitted.\"\\n\\n\"not entirely.  it may be proper to conceal their\\nengagement (if they are engaged) from mrs. smith--\\nand if that is the case, it must be highly expedient\\nfor willoughby to be but little in devonshire at present.\\nbut this is no excuse for their concealing it from us.\"\\n\\n\"concealing it from us! my dear child, do you accuse\\nwilloughby and marianne of concealment? this is strange\\nindeed, when your eyes have been reproaching them every day\\nfor incautiousness.\"\\n\\n\"i want no proof of their affection,\" said elinor;\\n\"but of their engagement i do.\"\\n\\n\"i am perfectly satisfied of both.\"\\n\\n\"yet not a syllable has been said to you on the\\nsubject, by either of them.\"\\n\\n\"i have not wanted syllables where actions have\\nspoken so plainly.  has not his behaviour to marianne\\nand to all of us, for at least the last fortnight,\\ndeclared that he loved and considered her as his future wife,\\nand that he felt for us the attachment of the nearest\\nrelation?  have we not perfectly understood each other?\\nhas not my consent been daily asked by his looks, his manner,\\nhis attentive and affectionate respect?  my elinor,\\nis it possible to doubt their engagement?  how could\\nsuch a thought occur to you?  how is it to be supposed\\nthat willoughby, persuaded as he must be of your\\nsister\\'s love, should leave her, and leave her perhaps\\nfor months, without telling her of his affection;--that\\nthey should part without a mutual exchange of confidence?\"\\n\\n\"i confess,\" replied elinor, \"that every circumstance\\nexcept one is in favour of their engagement;\\nbut that one is the total silence of both on the subject,\\nand with me it almost outweighs every other.\"\\n\\n\"how strange this is!  you must think wretchedly indeed\\nof willoughby, if, after all that has openly passed between them,\\nyou can doubt the nature of the terms on which they are together.\\nhas he been acting a part in his behaviour to your sister\\nall this time?  do you suppose him really indifferent to her?\"\\n\\n\"no, i cannot think that.  he must and does love her\\ni am sure.\"\\n\\n\"but with a strange kind of tenderness, if he can\\nleave her with such indifference, such carelessness\\nof the future, as you attribute to him.\"\\n\\n\"you must remember, my dear mother, that i have never\\nconsidered this matter as certain.  i have had my doubts,\\ni confess; but they are fainter than they were, and they\\nmay soon be entirely done away.  if we find they correspond,\\nevery fear of mine will be removed.\"\\n\\n\"a mighty concession indeed!  if you were to see\\nthem at the altar, you would suppose they were going to\\nbe married.  ungracious girl!  but i require no such proof.\\nnothing in my opinion has ever passed to justify doubt;\\nno secrecy has been attempted; all has been uniformly open\\nand unreserved.  you cannot doubt your sister\\'s wishes.\\nit must be willoughby therefore whom you suspect.  but why?\\nis he not a man of honour and feeling? has there been any\\ninconsistency on his side to create alarm? can he be deceitful?\"\\n\\n\"i hope not, i believe not,\" cried elinor.\\n\"i love willoughby, sincerely love him; and suspicion of his\\nintegrity cannot be more painful to yourself than to me.\\nit has been involuntary, and i will not encourage it.\\ni was startled, i confess, by the alteration in his\\nmanners this morning;--he did not speak like himself,\\nand did not return your kindness with any cordiality.\\nbut all this may be explained by such a situation of his\\naffairs as you have supposed.  he had just parted from\\nmy sister, had seen her leave him in the greatest affliction;\\nand if he felt obliged, from a fear of offending mrs. smith,\\nto resist the temptation of returning here soon, and yet\\naware that by declining your invitation, by saying\\nthat he was going away for some time, he should seem\\nto act an ungenerous, a suspicious part by our family,\\nbe might well be embarrassed and disturbed.  in such a case,\\na plain and open avowal of his difficulties would have been\\nmore to his honour i think, as well as more consistent\\nwith his general character;--but i will not raise objections\\nagainst any one\\'s conduct on so illiberal a foundation,\\nas a difference in judgment from myself, or a deviation from\\nwhat i may think right and consistent.\"\\n\\n\"you speak very properly.  willoughby certainly does\\nnot deserve to be suspected.  though we have not known\\nhim long, he is no stranger in this part of the world;\\nand who has ever spoken to his disadvantage?  had he been\\nin a situation to act independently and marry immediately,\\nit might have been odd that he should leave us without\\nacknowledging everything to me at once: but this is not the case.\\nit is an engagement in some respects not prosperously begun,\\nfor their marriage must be at a very uncertain distance;\\nand even secrecy, as far as it can be observed, may now\\nbe very advisable.\"\\n\\nthey were interrupted by the entrance of margaret;\\nand elinor was then at liberty to think over the representations\\nof her mother, to acknowledge the probability of many,\\nand hope for the justice of all.\\n\\nthey saw nothing of marianne till dinner time,\\nwhen she entered the room and took her place at the table\\nwithout saying a word.  her eyes were red and swollen;\\nand it seemed as if her tears were even then restrained\\nwith difficulty.  she avoided the looks of them all,\\ncould neither eat nor speak, and after some time, on her\\nmother\\'s silently pressing her hand with tender compassion,\\nher small degree of fortitude was quite overcome, she burst\\ninto tears and left the room.\\n\\nthis violent oppression of spirits continued the\\nwhole evening.  she was without any power, because she\\nwas without any desire of command over herself.\\nthe slightest mention of anything relative to willoughby\\noverpowered her in an instant; and though her family\\nwere most anxiously attentive to her comfort, it was\\nimpossible for them, if they spoke at all, to keep clear\\nof every subject which her feelings connected with him.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 16\\n\\n\\nmarianne would have thought herself very inexcusable\\nhad she been able to sleep at all the first night\\nafter parting from willoughby.  she would have been\\nashamed to look her family in the face the next morning,\\nhad she not risen from her bed in more need of repose\\nthan when she lay down in it.  but the feelings which\\nmade such composure a disgrace, left her in no danger\\nof incurring it.  she was awake the whole night, and she\\nwept the greatest part of it.  she got up with a headache,\\nwas unable to talk, and unwilling to take any nourishment;\\ngiving pain every moment to her mother and sisters,\\nand forbidding all attempt at consolation from either.\\nher sensibility was potent enough!\\n\\nwhen breakfast was over she walked out by herself,\\nand wandered about the village of allenham, indulging the\\nrecollection of past enjoyment and crying over the present\\nreverse for the chief of the morning.\\n\\nthe evening passed off in the equal indulgence of feeling.\\nshe played over every favourite song that she had been used\\nto play to willoughby, every air in which their voices\\nhad been oftenest joined, and sat at the instrument gazing\\non every line of music that he had written out for her,\\ntill her heart was so heavy that no farther sadness\\ncould be gained; and this nourishment of grief was every\\nday applied.  she spent whole hours at the pianoforte\\nalternately singing and crying; her voice often totally\\nsuspended by her tears.  in books too, as well as in music,\\nshe courted the misery which a contrast between the past\\nand present was certain of giving.  she read nothing\\nbut what they had been used to read together.\\n\\nsuch violence of affliction indeed could not be supported\\nfor ever; it sunk within a few days into a calmer melancholy;\\nbut these employments, to which she daily recurred,\\nher solitary walks and silent meditations, still produced\\noccasional effusions of sorrow as lively as ever.\\n\\nno letter from willoughby came; and none seemed expected\\nby marianne.  her mother was surprised, and elinor again\\nbecame uneasy.  but mrs. dashwood could find explanations\\nwhenever she wanted them, which at least satisfied herself.\\n\\n\"remember, elinor,\" said she, \"how very often sir john\\nfetches our letters himself from the post, and carries them\\nto it.  we have already agreed that secrecy may be necessary,\\nand we must acknowledge that it could not be maintained if\\ntheir correspondence were to pass through sir john\\'s hands.\"\\n\\nelinor could not deny the truth of this, and she tried\\nto find in it a motive sufficient for their silence.\\nbut there was one method so direct, so simple, and in\\nher opinion so eligible of knowing the real state\\nof the affair, and of instantly removing all mystery,\\nthat she could not help suggesting it to her mother.\\n\\n\"why do you not ask marianne at once,\" said she,\\n\"whether she is or she is not engaged to willoughby?  from you,\\nher mother, and so kind, so indulgent a mother, the question\\ncould not give offence.  it would be the natural result\\nof your affection for her.  she used to be all unreserve,\\nand to you more especially.\"\\n\\n\"i would not ask such a question for the world.\\nsupposing it possible that they are not engaged,\\nwhat distress would not such an enquiry inflict!  at any\\nrate it would be most ungenerous.  i should never deserve\\nher confidence again, after forcing from her a confession\\nof what is meant at present to be unacknowledged to any one.\\ni know marianne\\'s heart: i know that she dearly loves me,\\nand that i shall not be the last to whom the affair is made\\nknown,\\nwhen circumstances make the revealment of it eligible.\\ni would not attempt to force the confidence of any one;\\nof a child much less; because a sense of duty would prevent\\nthe denial which her wishes might direct.\"\\n\\nelinor thought this generosity overstrained,\\nconsidering her sister\\'s youth, and urged the matter farther,\\nbut in vain; common sense, common care, common prudence,\\nwere all sunk in mrs. dashwood\\'s romantic delicacy.\\n\\nit was several days before willoughby\\'s name\\nwas mentioned before marianne by any of her family;\\nsir john and mrs. jennings, indeed, were not so nice;\\ntheir witticisms added pain to many a painful hour;--\\nbut one evening, mrs. dashwood, accidentally taking up a\\nvolume of shakespeare, exclaimed,\\n\\n\"we have never finished hamlet, marianne; our dear\\nwilloughby went away before we could get through it.\\nwe will put it by, that when he comes again...but it may\\nbe months, perhaps, before that happens.\"\\n\\n\"months!\" cried marianne, with strong surprise.\\n\"no--nor many weeks.\"\\n\\nmrs. dashwood was sorry for what she had said;\\nbut it gave elinor pleasure, as it produced a reply\\nfrom marianne so expressive of confidence in willoughby\\nand knowledge of his intentions.\\n\\none morning, about a week after his leaving the country,\\nmarianne was prevailed on to join her sisters in their\\nusual walk, instead of wandering away by herself.\\nhitherto she had carefully avoided every companion in\\nher rambles.  if her sisters intended to walk on the downs,\\nshe directly stole away towards the lanes; if they talked\\nof the valley, she was as speedy in climbing the hills,\\nand could never be found when the others set off.\\nbut at length she was secured by the exertions of elinor,\\nwho greatly disapproved such continual seclusion.  they walked\\nalong the road through the valley, and chiefly in silence,\\nfor marianne\\'s mind could not be controlled, and elinor,\\nsatisfied with gaining one point, would not then attempt more.\\nbeyond the entrance of the valley, where the country,\\nthough still rich, was less wild and more open, a long\\nstretch of the road which they had travelled on first coming\\nto barton, lay before them; and on reaching that point,\\nthey stopped to look around them, and examine a prospect\\nwhich formed the distance of their view from the cottage,\\nfrom a spot which they had never happened to reach in any\\nof their walks before.\\n\\namongst the objects in the scene, they soon discovered\\nan animated one; it was a man on horseback riding towards them.\\nin a few minutes they could distinguish him to be a gentleman;\\nand in a moment afterwards marianne rapturously exclaimed,\\n\\n\"it is he; it is indeed;--i know it is!\"--and was\\nhastening to meet him, when elinor cried out,\\n\\n\"indeed, marianne, i think you are mistaken.  it is\\nnot willoughby.  the person is not tall enough for him,\\nand has not his air.\"\\n\\n\"he has, he has,\" cried marianne, \"i am sure he has.\\nhis air, his coat, his horse.  i knew how soon he would come.\"\\n\\nshe walked eagerly on as she spoke; and elinor,\\nto screen marianne from particularity, as she felt almost\\ncertain of its not being willoughby, quickened her\\npace and kept up with her.  they were soon within\\nthirty yards of the gentleman.  marianne looked again;\\nher heart sunk within her; and abruptly turning round,\\nshe was hurrying back, when the voices of both her sisters\\nwere raised to detain her; a third, almost as well known\\nas willoughby\\'s, joined them in begging her to stop,\\nand she turned round with surprise to see and welcome\\nedward ferrars.\\n\\nhe was the only person in the world who could\\nat that moment be forgiven for not being willoughby;\\nthe only one who could have gained a smile from her;\\nbut she dispersed her tears to smile on him, and in her\\nsister\\'s happiness forgot for a time her own disappointment.\\n\\nhe dismounted, and giving his horse to his servant,\\nwalked back with them to barton, whither he was purposely\\ncoming to visit them.\\n\\nhe was welcomed by them all with great cordiality,\\nbut especially by marianne, who showed more warmth of\\nregard in her reception of him than even elinor herself.\\nto marianne, indeed, the meeting between edward and her sister\\nwas but a continuation of that unaccountable coldness which she\\nhad often observed at norland in their mutual behaviour.\\non edward\\'s side, more particularly, there was a deficiency\\nof all that a lover ought to look and say on such an occasion.\\nhe was confused, seemed scarcely sensible of pleasure\\nin seeing them, looked neither rapturous nor gay,\\nsaid little but what was forced from him by questions,\\nand distinguished elinor by no mark of affection.\\nmarianne saw and listened with increasing surprise.\\nshe began almost to feel a dislike of edward; and it ended,\\nas every feeling must end with her, by carrying back her\\nthoughts to willoughby, whose manners formed a contrast\\nsufficiently striking to those of his brother elect.\\n\\nafter a short silence which succeeded the first\\nsurprise and enquiries of meeting, marianne asked\\nedward if he came directly from london.  no, he had\\nbeen in devonshire a fortnight.\\n\\n\"a fortnight!\" she repeated, surprised at his being\\nso long in the same county with elinor without seeing\\nher before.\\n\\nhe looked rather distressed as he added, that he\\nhad been staying with some friends near plymouth.\\n\\n\"have you been lately in sussex?\" said elinor.\\n\\n\"i was at norland about a month ago.\"\\n\\n\"and how does dear, dear norland look?\" cried marianne.\\n\\n\"dear, dear norland,\" said elinor, \"probably looks\\nmuch as it always does at this time of the year.\\nthe woods and walks thickly covered with dead leaves.\"\\n\\n\"oh,\" cried marianne, \"with what transporting sensation\\nhave i formerly seen them fall!  how have i delighted,\\nas i walked, to see them driven in showers about me\\nby the wind!  what feelings have they, the season, the air\\naltogether inspired!  now there is no one to regard them.\\nthey are seen only as a nuisance, swept hastily off,\\nand driven as much as possible from the sight.\"\\n\\n\"it is not every one,\" said elinor, \"who has your\\npassion for dead leaves.\"\\n\\n\"no; my feelings are not often shared, not often\\nunderstood.  but sometimes they are.\"--as she said this,\\nshe sunk into a reverie for a few moments;--but rousing\\nherself again, \"now, edward,\" said she, calling his attention\\nto the prospect, \"here is barton valley.  look up to it,\\nand be tranquil if you can.  look at those hills!\\ndid you ever see their equals?  to the left is barton park,\\namongst those woods and plantations.  you may see the end\\nof the house.  and there, beneath that farthest hill,\\nwhich rises with such grandeur, is our cottage.\"\\n\\n\"it is a beautiful country,\" he replied; \"but these\\nbottoms must be dirty in winter.\"\\n\\n\"how can you think of dirt, with such objects before you?\"\\n\\n\"because,\" replied he, smiling, \"among the rest of the\\nobjects before me, i see a very dirty lane.\"\\n\\n\"how strange!\" said marianne to herself as she walked on.\\n\\n\"have you an agreeable neighbourhood here?  are the\\nmiddletons pleasant people?\"\\n\\n\"no, not all,\" answered marianne; \"we could not\\nbe more unfortunately situated.\"\\n\\n\"marianne,\" cried her sister, \"how can you say so? how can\\nyou be so unjust?  they are a very respectable family, mr.\\nferrars;\\nand towards us have behaved in the friendliest manner.  have you\\nforgot, marianne, how many pleasant days we have owed to them?\"\\n\\n\"no,\" said marianne, in a low voice, \"nor how many\\npainful moments.\"\\n\\nelinor took no notice of this; and directing\\nher attention to their visitor, endeavoured to support\\nsomething like discourse with him, by talking of their\\npresent residence, its conveniences, &c. extorting from him\\noccasional questions and remarks.  his coldness and reserve\\nmortified her severely; she was vexed and half angry;\\nbut resolving to regulate her behaviour to him by the past\\nrather than the present, she avoided every appearance\\nof resentment or displeasure, and treated him as she\\nthought he ought to be treated from the family connection.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 17\\n\\n\\nmrs. dashwood was surprised only for a moment at\\nseeing him; for his coming to barton was, in her opinion,\\nof all things the most natural.  her joy and expression\\nof regard long outlived her wonder.  he received the kindest\\nwelcome from her; and shyness, coldness, reserve could not\\nstand against such a reception.  they had begun to fail him\\nbefore he entered the house, and they were quite overcome\\nby the captivating manners of mrs. dashwood.  indeed a man\\ncould not very well be in love with either of her daughters,\\nwithout extending the passion to her; and elinor had the\\nsatisfaction of seeing him soon become more like himself.\\nhis affections seemed to reanimate towards them all,\\nand his interest in their welfare again became perceptible.\\nhe was not in spirits, however; he praised their house,\\nadmired its prospect, was attentive, and kind; but still\\nhe was not in spirits.  the whole family perceived it,\\nand mrs. dashwood, attributing it to some want of liberality\\nin his mother, sat down to table indignant against all\\nselfish parents.\\n\\n\"what are mrs. ferrars\\'s views for you at present, edward?\"\\nsaid she, when dinner was over and they had drawn round\\nthe fire; \"are you still to be a great orator in spite of\\nyourself?\"\\n\\n\"no. i hope my mother is now convinced that i have\\nno more talents than inclination for a public life!\"\\n\\n\"but how is your fame to be established? for famous you\\nmust be to satisfy all your family; and with no inclination\\nfor expense, no affection for strangers, no profession,\\nand no assurance, you may find it a difficult matter.\"\\n\\n\"i shall not attempt it.  i have no wish to be\\ndistinguished; and have every reason to hope i never shall.\\nthank heaven! i cannot be forced into genius and eloquence.\"\\n\\n\"you have no ambition, i well know.  your wishes\\nare all moderate.\"\\n\\n\"as moderate as those of the rest of the world,\\ni believe.  i wish as well as every body else to be\\nperfectly happy; but, like every body else it must be\\nin my own way.  greatness will not make me so.\"\\n\\n\"strange that it would!\" cried marianne.  \"what have\\nwealth or grandeur to do with happiness?\"\\n\\n\"grandeur has but little,\" said elinor, \"but wealth\\nhas much to do with it.\"\\n\\n\"elinor, for shame!\" said marianne, \"money can only\\ngive happiness where there is nothing else to give it.\\nbeyond a competence, it can afford no real satisfaction,\\nas far as mere self is concerned.\"\\n\\n\"perhaps,\" said elinor, smiling, \"we may come\\nto the same point.  your competence and my wealth\\nare very much alike, i dare say; and without them,\\nas the world goes now, we shall both agree that every\\nkind of external comfort must be wanting.  your ideas\\nare only more noble than mine.  come, what is your competence?\"\\n\\n\"about eighteen hundred or two thousand a year;\\nnot more than that.\"\\n\\nelinor laughed.  \"two thousand a year! one is my\\nwealth! i guessed how it would end.\"\\n\\n\"and yet two thousand a-year is a very moderate income,\"\\nsaid marianne.  \"a family cannot well be maintained on\\na smaller.  i am sure i am not extravagant in my demands.\\na proper establishment of servants, a carriage, perhaps two,\\nand hunters, cannot be supported on less.\"\\n\\nelinor smiled again, to hear her sister describing\\nso accurately their future expenses at combe magna.\\n\\n\"hunters!\" repeated edward--\"but why must you have\\nhunters?  every body does not hunt.\"\\n\\nmarianne coloured as she replied, \"but most people do.\"\\n\\n\"i wish,\" said margaret, striking out a novel thought,\\n\"that somebody would give us all a large fortune apiece!\"\\n\\n\"oh that they would!\" cried marianne, her eyes\\nsparkling with animation, and her cheeks glowing\\nwith the delight of such imaginary happiness.\\n\\n\"we are all unanimous in that wish, i suppose,\"\\nsaid elinor, \"in spite of the insufficiency of wealth.\"\\n\\n\"oh dear!\" cried margaret, \"how happy i should be!\\ni wonder what i should do with it!\"\\n\\nmarianne looked as if she had no doubt on that point.\\n\\n\"i should be puzzled to spend so large a fortune myself,\"\\nsaid mrs. dashwood, \"if my children were all to be rich\\nmy help.\"\\n\\n\"you must begin your improvements on this house,\"\\nobserved elinor, \"and your difficulties will soon vanish.\"\\n\\n\"what magnificent orders would travel from this family\\nto london,\" said edward, \"in such an event!  what a happy\\nday for booksellers, music-sellers, and print-shops!  you,\\nmiss dashwood, would give a general commission for every\\nnew print of merit to be sent you--and as for marianne,\\ni know her greatness of soul, there would not be music enough\\nin london to content her.  and books!--thomson, cowper,\\nscott--she would buy them all over and over again: she\\nwould buy up every copy, i believe, to prevent their\\nfalling into unworthy hands; and she would have every\\nbook that tells her how to admire an old twisted tree.\\nshould not you, marianne?  forgive me, if i am very saucy.\\nbut i was willing to shew you that i had not forgot our\\nold disputes.\"\\n\\n\"i love to be reminded of the past, edward--whether it\\nbe melancholy or gay, i love to recall it--and you\\nwill never offend me by talking of former times.\\nyou are very right in supposing how my money would be\\nspent--some of it, at least--my loose cash would certainly\\nbe employed in improving my collection of music and books.\"\\n\\n\"and the bulk of your fortune would be laid out\\nin annuities on the authors or their heirs.\"\\n\\n\"no, edward, i should have something else to do\\nwith it.\"\\n\\n\"perhaps, then, you would bestow it as a reward on that\\nperson who wrote the ablest defence of your favourite maxim,\\nthat no one can ever be in love more than once in their\\nlife--your opinion on that point is unchanged, i presume?\"\\n\\n\"undoubtedly. at my time of life opinions are tolerably fixed.\\nit is not likely that i should now see or hear any thing to\\nchange them.\"\\n\\n\"marianne is as steadfast as ever, you see,\" said elinor,\\n\"she is not at all altered.\"\\n\\n\"she is only grown a little more grave than she was.\"\\n\\n\"nay, edward,\" said marianne, \"you need not reproach me.\\nyou are not very gay yourself.\"\\n\\n\"why should you think so!\" replied he, with a sigh.\\n\"but gaiety never was a part of my character.\"\\n\\n\"nor do i think it a part of marianne\\'s,\" said elinor;\\n\"i should hardly call her a lively girl--she is very earnest,\\nvery eager in all she does--sometimes talks a great deal\\nand always with animation--but she is not often really merry.\"\\n\\n\"i believe you are right,\" he replied, \"and yet i\\nhave always set her down as a lively girl.\"\\n\\n\"i have frequently detected myself in such kind of mistakes,\"\\nsaid elinor, \"in a total misapprehension of character in some\\npoint or other: fancying people so much more gay or grave,\\nor ingenious or stupid than they really are, and i can\\nhardly tell why or in what the deception originated.\\nsometimes one is guided by what they say of themselves,\\nand very frequently by what other people say of them,\\nwithout giving oneself time to deliberate and judge.\"\\n\\n\"but i thought it was right, elinor,\" said marianne,\\n\"to be guided wholly by the opinion of other people.\\ni thought our judgments were given us merely to be subservient\\nto those of neighbours.  this has always been your doctrine,\\ni am sure.\"\\n\\n\"no, marianne, never.  my doctrine has never aimed\\nat the subjection of the understanding.  all i have\\never attempted to influence has been the behaviour.\\nyou must not confound my meaning.  i am guilty, i confess,\\nof having often wished you to treat our acquaintance\\nin general with greater attention; but when have i advised\\nyou to adopt their sentiments or to conform to their\\njudgment in serious matters?\"\\n\\n\"you have not been able to bring your sister over to your\\nplan of general civility,\" said edward to elinor, \"do you gain\\nno ground?\"\\n\\n\"quite the contrary,\" replied elinor,\\nlooking expressively at marianne.\\n\\n\"my judgment,\" he returned, \"is all on your side\\nof the question; but i am afraid my practice is much\\nmore on your sister\\'s.  i never wish to offend, but i\\nam so foolishly shy, that i often seem negligent,\\nwhen i am only kept back by my natural awkwardness.\\ni have frequently thought that i must have been intended\\nby nature to be fond of low company, i am so little at\\nmy ease among strangers of gentility!\"\\n\\n\"marianne has not shyness to excuse any inattention\\nof hers,\" said elinor.\\n\\n\"she knows her own worth too well for false shame,\"\\nreplied edward.  \"shyness is only the effect of a sense\\nof inferiority in some way or other.  if i could persuade\\nmyself that my manners were perfectly easy and graceful,\\ni should not be shy.\"\\n\\n\"but you would still be reserved,\" said marianne,\\n\"and that is worse.\"\\n\\nedward started--\"reserved! am i reserved, marianne?\"\\n\\n\"yes, very.\"\\n\\n\"i do not understand you,\" replied he, colouring.\\n\"reserved!--how, in what manner?  what am i to tell you?\\nwhat can you suppose?\"\\n\\nelinor looked surprised at his emotion; but trying\\nto laugh off the subject, she said to him, \"do not you\\nknow my sister well enough to understand what she means?\\ndo not you know she calls every one reserved who does not\\ntalk as fast, and admire what she admires as rapturously\\nas herself?\"\\n\\nedward made no answer.  his gravity and thoughtfulness\\nreturned on him in their fullest extent--and he sat\\nfor some time silent and dull.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 18\\n\\n\\nelinor saw, with great uneasiness the low spirits\\nof her friend.  his visit afforded her but a very\\npartial satisfaction, while his own enjoyment in it\\nappeared so imperfect.  it was evident that he was unhappy;\\nshe wished it were equally evident that he still\\ndistinguished her by the same affection which once\\nshe had felt no doubt of inspiring; but hitherto the\\ncontinuance of his preference seemed very uncertain;\\nand the reservedness of his manner towards her contradicted\\none moment what a more animated look had intimated the preceding\\none.\\n\\nhe joined her and marianne in the breakfast-room\\nthe next morning before the others were down; and marianne,\\nwho was always eager to promote their happiness as far\\nas she could, soon left them to themselves.  but before she\\nwas half way upstairs she heard the parlour door open, and,\\nturning round, was astonished to see edward himself come out.\\n\\n\"i am going into the village to see my horses,\"\\nsaid be, \"as you are not yet ready for breakfast; i shall\\nbe back again presently.\"\\n\\n                    ***\\n\\nedward returned to them with fresh admiration\\nof the surrounding country; in his walk to the village,\\nhe had seen many parts of the valley to advantage;\\nand the village itself, in a much higher situation than\\nthe cottage, afforded a general view of the whole, which had\\nexceedingly pleased him.  this was a subject which ensured\\nmarianne\\'s attention, and she was beginning to describe\\nher own admiration of these scenes, and to question him more\\nminutely on the objects that had particularly struck him,\\nwhen edward interrupted her by saying, \"you must not\\nenquire too far, marianne--remember i have no knowledge\\nin the picturesque, and i shall offend you by my ignorance\\nand want of taste if we come to particulars.  i shall call\\nhills steep, which ought to be bold; surfaces strange\\nand uncouth, which ought to be irregular and rugged;\\nand distant objects out of sight, which ought only to be\\nindistinct through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere.\\nyou must be satisfied with such admiration as i can\\nhonestly give.  i call it a very fine country--the\\nhills are steep, the woods seem full of fine timber,\\nand the valley looks comfortable and snug--with rich\\nmeadows and several neat farm houses scattered here\\nand there.  it exactly answers my idea of a fine country,\\nbecause it unites beauty with utility--and i dare say it\\nis a picturesque one too, because you admire it; i can\\neasily believe it to be full of rocks and promontories,\\ngrey moss and brush wood, but these are all lost on me.\\ni know nothing of the picturesque.\"\\n\\n\"i am afraid it is but too true,\" said marianne;\\n\"but why should you boast of it?\"\\n\\n\"i suspect,\" said elinor, \"that to avoid one kind\\nof affectation, edward here falls into another.  because he\\nbelieves many people pretend to more admiration of the beauties\\nof nature than they really feel, and is disgusted with\\nsuch pretensions, he affects greater indifference and less\\ndiscrimination in viewing them himself than he possesses.\\nhe is fastidious and will have an affectation of his own.\"\\n\\n\"it is very true,\" said marianne, \"that admiration\\nof landscape scenery is become a mere jargon.\\nevery body pretends to feel and tries to describe with\\nthe taste and elegance of him who first defined what\\npicturesque beauty was.  i detest jargon of every kind,\\nand sometimes i have kept my feelings to myself,\\nbecause i could find no language to describe them\\nin but what was worn and hackneyed out of all sense and meaning.\"\\n\\n\"i am convinced,\" said edward, \"that you really feel\\nall the delight in a fine prospect which you profess\\nto feel.  but, in return, your sister must allow me\\nto feel no more than i profess.  i like a fine prospect,\\nbut not on picturesque principles.  i do not like crooked,\\ntwisted, blasted trees.  i admire them much more if they\\nare tall, straight, and flourishing.  i do not like ruined,\\ntattered cottages.  i am not fond of nettles or thistles,\\nor heath blossoms.  i have more pleasure in a snug\\nfarm-house than a watch-tower--and a troop of tidy,\\nhappy villages please me better than the finest banditti\\nin the world.\"\\n\\nmarianne looked with amazement at edward,\\nwith compassion at her sister.  elinor only laughed.\\n\\nthe subject was continued no farther; and marianne\\nremained thoughtfully silent, till a new object suddenly\\nengaged her attention.  she was sitting by edward, and\\nin taking his tea from mrs. dashwood, his hand passed\\nso directly before her, as to make a ring, with a plait\\nof hair in the centre, very conspicuous on one of his fingers.\\n\\n\"i never saw you wear a ring before, edward,\" she cried.\\n\"is that fanny\\'s hair? i remember her promising to give\\nyou some.  but i should have thought her hair had been darker.\"\\n\\nmarianne spoke inconsiderately what she really felt--\\nbut when she saw how much she had pained edward, her own\\nvexation at her want of thought could not be surpassed\\nby his.  he coloured very deeply, and giving a momentary\\nglance at elinor, replied, \"yes; it is my sister\\'s hair.\\nthe setting always casts a different shade on it,\\nyou know.\"\\n\\nelinor had met his eye, and looked conscious likewise.\\nthat the hair was her own, she instantaneously felt as\\nwell satisfied as marianne; the only difference in their\\nconclusions was, that what marianne considered as a free\\ngift from her sister, elinor was conscious must have been\\nprocured by some theft or contrivance unknown to herself.\\nshe was not in a humour, however, to regard it as an affront,\\nand affecting to take no notice of what passed,\\nby instantly talking of something else, she internally\\nresolved henceforward to catch every opportunity of eyeing\\nthe hair and of satisfying herself, beyond all doubt,\\nthat it was exactly the shade of her own.\\n\\nedward\\'s embarrassment lasted some time, and it\\nended in an absence of mind still more settled.\\nhe was particularly grave the whole morning.\\nmarianne severely censured herself for what she had said;\\nbut her own forgiveness might have been more speedy,\\nhad she known how little offence it had given her sister.\\n\\nbefore the middle of the day, they were visited by sir\\njohn and mrs. jennings, who, having heard of the arrival\\nof a gentleman at the cottage, came to take a survey\\nof the guest.  with the assistance of his mother-in-law,\\nsir john was not long in discovering that the name of\\nferrars began with an f. and this prepared a future mine\\nof raillery against the devoted elinor, which nothing but\\nthe newness of their acquaintance with edward could have\\nprevented from being immediately sprung.  but, as it was,\\nshe only learned, from some very significant looks, how far\\ntheir penetration, founded on margaret\\'s instructions, extended.\\n\\nsir john never came to the dashwoods without either\\ninviting them to dine at the park the next day, or to drink\\ntea with them that evening.  on the present occasion,\\nfor the better entertainment of their visitor, towards\\nwhose amusement he felt himself bound to contribute,\\nhe wished to engage them for both.\\n\\n\"you must drink tea with us to night,\" said he,\\n\"for we shall be quite alone--and tomorrow you must\\nabsolutely dine with us, for we shall be a large party.\"\\n\\nmrs. jennings enforced the necessity.  \"and who knows\\nbut you may raise a dance,\" said she.  \"and that will\\ntempt you, miss marianne.\"\\n\\n\"a dance!\" cried marianne.  \"impossible! who is to dance?\"\\n\\n\"who! why yourselves, and the careys, and whitakers\\nto be sure.--what! you thought nobody could dance\\nbecause a certain person that shall be nameless is gone!\"\\n\\n\"i wish with all my soul,\" cried sir john,\\n\"that willoughby were among us again.\"\\n\\nthis, and marianne\\'s blushing, gave new suspicions\\nto edward.  \"and who is willoughby?\" said he, in a low voice,\\nto miss dashwood, by whom he was sitting.\\n\\nshe gave him a brief reply.  marianne\\'s countenance\\nwas more communicative.  edward saw enough to comprehend,\\nnot only the meaning of others, but such of marianne\\'s\\nexpressions as had puzzled him before; and when their\\nvisitors left them, he went immediately round her, and said,\\nin a whisper, \"i have been guessing.  shall i tell you\\nmy guess?\"\\n\\n\"what do you mean?\"\\n\\n\"shall i tell you.\"\\n\\n\"certainly.\"\\n\\n\"well then; i guess that mr. willoughby hunts.\"\\n\\nmarianne was surprised and confused, yet she could\\nnot help smiling at the quiet archness of his manner,\\nand after a moment\\'s silence, said,\\n\\n\"oh, edward! how can you?--but the time will come\\ni hope...i am sure you will like him.\"\\n\\n\"i do not doubt it,\" replied he, rather astonished\\nat her earnestness and warmth; for had he not imagined it\\nto be a joke for the good of her acquaintance in general,\\nfounded only on a something or a nothing between mr. willoughby\\nand herself, he would not have ventured to mention it.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 19\\n\\n\\nedward remained a week at the cottage; he was earnestly\\npressed by mrs. dashwood to stay longer; but, as if he\\nwere bent only on self-mortification, he seemed resolved\\nto be gone when his enjoyment among his friends was at\\nthe height.  his spirits, during the last two or three days,\\nthough still very unequal, were greatly improved--he grew\\nmore and more partial to the house and environs--never\\nspoke of going away without a sigh--declared his time\\nto be wholly disengaged--even doubted to what place he\\nshould go when he left them--but still, go he must.\\nnever had any week passed so quickly--he could hardly\\nbelieve it to be gone.  he said so repeatedly; other things\\nhe said too, which marked the turn of his feelings and gave\\nthe lie to his actions.  he had no pleasure at norland;\\nhe detested being in town; but either to norland or london,\\nhe must go.  he valued their kindness beyond any thing,\\nand his greatest happiness was in being with them.\\nyet, he must leave them at the end of a week, in spite\\nof their wishes and his own, and without any restraint\\non his time.\\n\\nelinor placed all that was astonishing in this\\nway of acting to his mother\\'s account; and it was\\nhappy for her that he had a mother whose character\\nwas so imperfectly known to her, as to be the general\\nexcuse for every thing strange on the part of her son.\\ndisappointed, however, and vexed as she was, and sometimes\\ndispleased with his uncertain behaviour to herself,\\nshe was very well disposed on the whole to regard his actions\\nwith all the candid allowances and generous qualifications,\\nwhich had been rather more painfully extorted from her,\\nfor willoughby\\'s service, by her mother.  his want of spirits,\\nof openness, and of consistency, were most usually\\nattributed to his want of independence, and his better\\nknowledge of mrs. ferrars\\'s disposition and designs.\\nthe shortness of his visit, the steadiness of his purpose\\nin leaving them, originated in the same fettered inclination,\\nthe same inevitable necessity of temporizing with his mother.\\nthe old well-established grievance of duty against will,\\nparent against child, was the cause of all.  she would have\\nbeen glad to know when these difficulties were to cease,\\nthis opposition was to yield,--when mrs. ferrars would\\nbe reformed, and her son be at liberty to be happy.\\nbut from such vain wishes she was forced to turn for comfort\\nto the renewal of her confidence in edward\\'s affection,\\nto the remembrance of every mark of regard in look or word\\nwhich fell from him while at barton, and above all\\nto that flattering proof of it which he constantly wore\\nround his finger.\\n\\n\"i think, edward,\" said mrs. dashwood, as they were\\nat breakfast the last morning, \"you would be a happier man\\nif you had any profession to engage your time and give\\nan interest to your plans and actions.  some inconvenience\\nto your friends, indeed, might result from it--you\\nwould not be able to give them so much of your time.\\nbut (with a smile) you would be materially benefited\\nin one particular at least--you would know where to go\\nwhen you left them.\"\\n\\n\"i do assure you,\" he replied, \"that i have long\\nthought on this point, as you think now.  it has been,\\nand is, and probably will always be a heavy misfortune\\nto me, that i have had no necessary business to engage me,\\nno profession to give me employment, or afford me any\\nthing like independence.  but unfortunately my own nicety,\\nand the nicety of my friends, have made me what i am,\\nan idle, helpless being.  we never could agree in our\\nchoice of a profession.  i always preferred the church,\\nas i still do.  but that was not smart enough for my family.\\nthey recommended the army.  that was a great deal\\ntoo smart for me.  the law was allowed to be genteel\\nenough; many young men, who had chambers in the temple,\\nmade a very good appearance in the first circles,\\nand drove about town in very knowing gigs.  but i had\\nno inclination for the law, even in this less abstruse\\nstudy of it, which my family approved.  as for the navy,\\nit had fashion on its side, but i was too old when the\\nsubject was first started to enter it--and, at length,\\nas there was no necessity for my having any profession\\nat all, as i might be as dashing and expensive without\\na red coat on my back as with one, idleness was pronounced\\non the whole to be most advantageous and honourable,\\nand a young man of eighteen is not in general so earnestly\\nbent on being busy as to resist the solicitations of his\\nfriends to do nothing.  i was therefore entered at oxford\\nand have been properly idle ever since.\"\\n\\n\"the consequence of which, i suppose, will be,\"\\nsaid mrs. dashwood, \"since leisure has not promoted\\nyour own happiness, that your sons will be brought up\\nto as many pursuits, employments, professions, and trades\\nas columella\\'s.\"\\n\\n\"they will be brought up,\" said he, in a serious accent,\\n\"to be as unlike myself as is possible.  in feeling,\\nin action, in condition, in every thing.\"\\n\\n\"come, come; this is all an effusion of immediate\\nwant of spirits, edward.  you are in a melancholy humour,\\nand fancy that any one unlike yourself must be happy.\\nbut remember that the pain of parting from friends\\nwill be felt by every body at times, whatever be their\\neducation or state.  know your own happiness.  you want\\nnothing but patience--or give it a more fascinating name,\\ncall it hope.  your mother will secure to you, in time,\\nthat independence you are so anxious for; it is her duty,\\nand it will, it must ere long become her happiness to\\nprevent your whole youth from being wasted in discontent.\\nhow much may not a few months do?\"\\n\\n\"i think,\" replied edward, \"that i may defy many\\nmonths to produce any good to me.\"\\n\\nthis desponding turn of mind, though it could not\\nbe communicated to mrs. dashwood, gave additional pain\\nto them all in the parting, which shortly took place,\\nand left an uncomfortable impression on elinor\\'s\\nfeelings especially, which required some trouble and time\\nto subdue.  but as it was her determination to subdue it,\\nand to prevent herself from appearing to suffer more than\\nwhat all her family suffered on his going away, she did\\nnot adopt the method so judiciously employed by marianne,\\non a similar occasion, to augment and fix her sorrow,\\nby seeking silence, solitude and idleness.  their means\\nwere as different as their objects, and equally suited\\nto the advancement of each.\\n\\nelinor sat down to her drawing-table as soon as he\\nwas out of the house, busily employed herself the whole day,\\nneither sought nor avoided the mention of his name,\\nappeared to interest herself almost as much as ever in the\\ngeneral concerns of the family, and if, by this conduct,\\nshe did not lessen her own grief, it was at least prevented\\nfrom unnecessary increase, and her mother and sisters\\nwere spared much solicitude on her account.\\n\\nsuch behaviour as this, so exactly the reverse\\nof her own, appeared no more meritorious to marianne,\\nthan her own had seemed faulty to her.  the business\\nof self-command she settled very easily;--with strong\\naffections it was impossible, with calm ones it could\\nhave no merit.  that her sister\\'s affections were calm,\\nshe dared not deny, though she blushed to acknowledge it;\\nand of the strength of her own, she gave a very striking proof,\\nby still loving and respecting that sister, in spite\\nof this mortifying conviction.\\n\\nwithout shutting herself up from her family,\\nor leaving the house in determined solitude to avoid them,\\nor lying awake the whole night to indulge meditation,\\nelinor found every day afforded her leisure enough\\nto think of edward, and of edward\\'s behaviour, in every\\npossible variety which the different state of her spirits\\nat different times could produce,--with tenderness,\\npity, approbation, censure, and doubt.  there were moments\\nin abundance, when, if not by the absence of her mother\\nand sisters, at least by the nature of their employments,\\nconversation was forbidden among them, and every effect\\nof solitude was produced.  her mind was inevitably\\nat liberty; her thoughts could not be chained elsewhere;\\nand the past and the future, on a subject so interesting,\\nmust be before her, must force her attention, and engross\\nher memory, her reflection, and her fancy.\\n\\nfrom a reverie of this kind, as she sat at her\\ndrawing-table, she was roused one morning, soon after\\nedward\\'s leaving them, by the arrival of company.\\nshe happened to be quite alone.  the closing of the\\nlittle gate, at the entrance of the green court in front\\nof the house, drew her eyes to the window, and she saw\\na large party walking up to the door.  amongst them\\nwere sir john and lady middleton and mrs. jennings,\\nbut there were two others, a gentleman and lady, who were\\nquite unknown to her.  she was sitting near the window,\\nand as soon as sir john perceived her, he left the rest\\nof the party to the ceremony of knocking at the door,\\nand stepping across the turf, obliged her to open the\\ncasement to speak to him, though the space was so short\\nbetween the door and the window, as to make it hardly\\npossible to speak at one without being heard at the other.\\n\\n\"well,\" said he, \"we have brought you some strangers.\\nhow do you like them?\"\\n\\n\"hush! they will hear you.\"\\n\\n\"never mind if they do.  it is only the palmers.\\ncharlotte is very pretty, i can tell you.  you may see her\\nif you look this way.\"\\n\\nas elinor was certain of seeing her in a couple\\nof minutes, without taking that liberty, she begged\\nto be excused.\\n\\n\"where is marianne? has she run away because we\\nare come? i see her instrument is open.\"\\n\\n\"she is walking, i believe.\"\\n\\nthey were now joined by mrs. jennings, who had not\\npatience enough to wait till the door was opened before\\nshe told her story.  she came hallooing to the window,\\n\"how do you do, my dear?  how does mrs. dashwood do?\\nand where are your sisters?  what! all alone! you\\nwill be glad of a little company to sit with you.\\ni have brought my other son and daughter to see you.\\nonly think of their coming so suddenly!  i thought i heard\\na carriage last night, while we were drinking our tea,\\nbut it never entered my head that it could be them.\\ni thought of nothing but whether it might not be colonel\\nbrandon come back again; so i said to sir john, i do think\\ni hear a carriage; perhaps it is colonel brandon come\\nback again\"--\\n\\nelinor was obliged to turn from her, in the middle\\nof her story, to receive the rest of the party; lady\\nmiddleton introduced the two strangers; mrs. dashwood\\nand margaret came down stairs at the same time, and they\\nall sat down to look at one another, while mrs. jennings\\ncontinued her story as she walked through the passage\\ninto the parlour, attended by sir john.\\n\\nmrs. palmer was several years younger than lady\\nmiddleton, and totally unlike her in every respect.\\nshe was short and plump, had a very pretty face,\\nand the finest expression of good humour in it that could\\npossibly be.  her manners were by no means so elegant\\nas her sister\\'s, but they were much more prepossessing.\\nshe came in with a smile, smiled all the time of her visit,\\nexcept when she laughed, and smiled when she went away.\\nher husband was a grave looking young man of five or six\\nand twenty, with an air of more fashion and sense than\\nhis wife, but of less willingness to please or be pleased.\\nhe entered the room with a look of self-consequence,\\nslightly bowed to the ladies, without speaking a word,\\nand, after briefly surveying them and their apartments,\\ntook up a newspaper from the table, and continued to read it\\nas long as he staid.\\n\\nmrs. palmer, on the contrary, who was strongly endowed\\nby nature with a turn for being uniformly civil and happy,\\nwas hardly seated before her admiration of the parlour\\nand every thing in it burst forth.\\n\\n\"well! what a delightful room this is! i never\\nsaw anything so charming!  only think, mamma, how it\\nis improved since i was here last! i always thought it\\nsuch a sweet place, ma\\'am! (turning to mrs. dashwood)\\nbut you have made it so charming!  only look, sister,\\nhow delightful every thing is! how i should like such\\na house for myself!  should not you, mr. palmer?\"\\n\\nmr. palmer made her no answer, and did not even raise\\nhis eyes from the newspaper.\\n\\n\"mr. palmer does not hear me,\" said she, laughing;\\n\"he never does sometimes.  it is so ridiculous!\"\\n\\nthis was quite a new idea to mrs. dashwood; she had\\nnever been used to find wit in the inattention of any one,\\nand could not help looking with surprise at them both.\\n\\nmrs. jennings, in the meantime, talked on as loud\\nas she could, and continued her account of their surprise,\\nthe evening before, on seeing their friends, without\\nceasing till every thing was told.  mrs. palmer laughed\\nheartily at the recollection of their astonishment,\\nand every body agreed, two or three times over, that it\\nhad been quite an agreeable surprise.\\n\\n\"you may believe how glad we all were to see them,\"\\nadded mrs. jennings, leaning forward towards elinor,\\nand speaking in a low voice as if she meant to be heard\\nby no one else, though they were seated on different sides\\nof the room; \"but, however, i can\\'t help wishing they had\\nnot travelled quite so fast, nor made such a long journey\\nof it, for they came all round by london upon account\\nof some business, for you know (nodding significantly and\\npointing to her daughter) it was wrong in her situation.\\ni wanted her to stay at home and rest this morning,\\nbut she would come with us; she longed so much to see\\nyou all!\"\\n\\nmrs. palmer laughed, and said it would not do her\\nany harm.\\n\\n\"she expects to be confined in february,\"\\ncontinued mrs. jennings.\\n\\nlady middleton could no longer endure such a conversation,\\nand therefore exerted herself to ask mr. palmer if there\\nwas any news in the paper.\\n\\n\"no, none at all,\" he replied, and read on.\\n\\n\"here comes marianne,\" cried sir john.  \"now, palmer,\\nyou shall see a monstrous pretty girl.\"\\n\\nhe immediately went into the passage, opened the front door,\\nand ushered her in himself.  mrs. jennings asked her,\\nas soon as she appeared, if she had not been to allenham;\\nand mrs. palmer laughed so heartily at the question,\\nas to show she understood it.  mr. palmer looked up\\non her entering the room, stared at her some minutes,\\nand then returned to his newspaper.  mrs. palmer\\'s eye\\nwas now caught by the drawings which hung round the room.\\nshe got up to examine them.\\n\\n\"oh! dear, how beautiful these are!  well! how delightful!\\ndo but look, mama, how sweet! i declare they are quite charming;\\ni could look at them for ever.\" and then sitting down again,\\nshe very soon forgot that there were any such things in the room.\\n\\nwhen lady middleton rose to go away, mr. palmer\\nrose also, laid down the newspaper, stretched himself\\nand looked at them all around.\\n\\n\"my love, have you been asleep?\" said his wife, laughing.\\n\\nhe made her no answer; and only observed, after again\\nexamining the room, that it was very low pitched,\\nand that the ceiling was crooked.  he then made his bow,\\nand departed with the rest.\\n\\nsir john had been very urgent with them all to\\nspend the next day at the park.  mrs. dashwood, who did\\nnot chuse to dine with them oftener than they dined\\nat the cottage, absolutely refused on her own account;\\nher daughters might do as they pleased.  but they had no\\ncuriosity to see how mr. and mrs. palmer ate their dinner,\\nand no expectation of pleasure from them in any other way.\\nthey attempted, therefore, likewise, to excuse themselves;\\nthe weather was uncertain, and not likely to be good.\\nbut sir john would not be satisfied--the carriage should\\nbe sent for them and they must come.  lady middleton too,\\nthough she did not press their mother, pressed them.\\nmrs. jennings and mrs. palmer joined their entreaties, all\\nseemed equally anxious to avoid a family party; and the young\\nladies were obliged to yield.\\n\\n\"why should they ask us?\" said marianne, as soon as they\\nwere gone.  \"the rent of this cottage is said to be low;\\nbut we have it on very hard terms, if we are to dine\\nat the park whenever any one is staying either with them,\\nor with us.\"\\n\\n\"they mean no less to be civil and kind to us now,\"\\nsaid elinor, \"by these frequent invitations, than by\\nthose which we received from them a few weeks ago.\\nthe alteration is not in them, if their parties are grown\\ntedious and dull.  we must look for the change elsewhere.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 20\\n\\n\\nas the miss dashwoods entered the drawing-room of the park\\nthe next day, at one door, mrs. palmer came running in at\\nthe other, looking as good humoured and merry as before.\\nshe took them all most affectionately by the hand,\\nand expressed great delight in seeing them again.\\n\\n\"i am so glad to see you!\" said she, seating herself\\nbetween elinor and marianne, \"for it is so bad a day i was\\nafraid you might not come, which would be a shocking thing,\\nas we go away again tomorrow. we must go, for the westons\\ncome to us next week you know.  it was quite a sudden thing\\nour coming at all, and i knew nothing of it till the carriage\\nwas coming to the door, and then mr. palmer asked me if i\\nwould go with him to barton.  he is so droll! he never\\ntells me any thing! i am so sorry we cannot stay longer;\\nhowever we shall meet again in town very soon, i hope.\"\\n\\nthey were obliged to put an end to such an expectation.\\n\\n\"not go to town!\" cried mrs. palmer, with a laugh,\\n\"i shall be quite disappointed if you do not.  i could\\nget the nicest house in world for you, next door to ours,\\nin hanover-square.  you must come, indeed.  i am sure\\ni shall be very happy to chaperon you at any time till\\ni am confined, if mrs. dashwood should not like to go\\ninto public.\"\\n\\nthey thanked her; but were obliged to resist all\\nher entreaties.\\n\\n\"oh, my love,\" cried mrs. palmer to her husband,\\nwho just then entered the room--\"you must help me to\\npersuade the miss dashwoods to go to town this winter.\"\\n\\nher love made no answer; and after slightly bowing\\nto the ladies, began complaining of the weather.\\n\\n\"how horrid all this is!\" said he.  \"such weather\\nmakes every thing and every body disgusting.  dullness\\nis as much produced within doors as without, by rain.\\nit makes one detest all one\\'s acquaintance.  what the\\ndevil does sir john mean by not having a billiard room\\nin his house?  how few people know what comfort is!  sir\\njohn is as stupid as the weather.\"\\n\\nthe rest of the company soon dropt in.\\n\\n\"i am afraid, miss marianne,\" said sir john, \"you have\\nnot been able to take your usual walk to allenham today.\"\\n\\nmarianne looked very grave and said nothing.\\n\\n\"oh, don\\'t be so sly before us,\" said mrs. palmer;\\n\"for we know all about it, i assure you; and i admire your\\ntaste very much, for i think he is extremely handsome.\\nwe do not live a great way from him in the country, you know.\\nnot above ten miles, i dare say.\"\\n\\n\"much nearer thirty,\" said her husband.\\n\\n\"ah, well! there is not much difference.\\ni never was at his house; but they say it is a sweet\\npretty place.\"\\n\\n\"as vile a spot as i ever saw in my life,\"\\nsaid mr. palmer.\\n\\nmarianne remained perfectly silent, though her\\ncountenance betrayed her interest in what was said.\\n\\n\"is it very ugly?\" continued mrs. palmer--\"then it\\nmust be some other place that is so pretty i suppose.\"\\n\\nwhen they were seated in the dining room, sir john\\nobserved with regret that they were only eight all together.\\n\\n\"my dear,\" said he to his lady, \"it is very provoking\\nthat we should be so few.  why did not you ask the gilberts\\nto come to us today?\"\\n\\n\"did not i tell you, sir john, when you spoke to me\\nabout it before, that it could not be done?  they dined\\nwith us last.\"\\n\\n\"you and i, sir john,\" said mrs. jennings,\\n\"should not stand upon such ceremony.\"\\n\\n\"then you would be very ill-bred,\" cried mr. palmer.\\n\\n\"my love you contradict every body,\" said his wife\\nwith her usual laugh.  \"do you know that you are quite rude?\"\\n\\n\"i did not know i contradicted any body in calling\\nyour mother ill-bred.\"\\n\\n\"ay, you may abuse me as you please,\" said the good-natured\\nold lady, \"you have taken charlotte off my hands, and cannot\\ngive her back again.  so there i have the whip hand of you.\"\\n\\ncharlotte laughed heartily to think that her\\nhusband could not get rid of her; and exultingly said,\\nshe did not care how cross he was to her, as they must\\nlive together.  it was impossible for any one to be more\\nthoroughly good-natured, or more determined to be happy\\nthan mrs. palmer.  the studied indifference, insolence,\\nand discontent of her husband gave her no pain;\\nand when he scolded or abused her, she was highly diverted.\\n\\n\"mr. palmer is so droll!\" said she, in a whisper,\\nto elinor.  \"he is always out of humour.\"\\n\\nelinor was not inclined, after a little observation,\\nto give him credit for being so genuinely and unaffectedly\\nill-natured or ill-bred as he wished to appear.\\nhis temper might perhaps be a little soured by finding,\\nlike many others of his sex, that through some unaccountable\\nbias in favour of beauty, he was the husband of a very silly\\nwoman,--but she knew that this kind of blunder was too\\ncommon for any sensible man to be lastingly hurt by it.--\\nit was rather a wish of distinction, she believed,\\nwhich produced his contemptuous treatment of every body,\\nand his general abuse of every thing before him.\\nit was the desire of appearing superior to other people.\\nthe motive was too common to be wondered at; but the means,\\nhowever they might succeed by establishing his superiority\\nin ill-breeding, were not likely to attach any one to him\\nexcept his wife.\\n\\n\"oh, my dear miss dashwood,\" said mrs. palmer soon afterwards,\\n\"i have got such a favour to ask of you and your sister.\\nwill you come and spend some time at cleveland this\\nchristmas?  now, pray do,--and come while the westons are\\nwith us.  you cannot think how happy i shall be!  it will\\nbe quite delightful!--my love,\" applying to her husband,\\n\"don\\'t you long to have the miss dashwoods come to cleveland?\"\\n\\n\"certainly,\" he replied, with a sneer--\"i came\\ninto devonshire with no other view.\"\\n\\n\"there now,\"--said his lady, \"you see mr. palmer\\nexpects you; so you cannot refuse to come.\"\\n\\nthey both eagerly and resolutely declined her invitation.\\n\\n\"but indeed you must and shall come.  i am sure you\\nwill like it of all things.  the westons will be with us,\\nand it will be quite delightful.  you cannot think\\nwhat a sweet place cleveland is; and we are so gay now,\\nfor mr. palmer is always going about the country canvassing\\nagainst the election; and so many people came to dine\\nwith us that i never saw before, it is quite charming!  but,\\npoor fellow! it is very fatiguing to him! for he is forced\\nto make every body like him.\"\\n\\nelinor could hardly keep her countenance as she\\nassented to the hardship of such an obligation.\\n\\n\"how charming it will be,\" said charlotte, \"when he\\nis in parliament!--won\\'t it? how i shall laugh!  it will\\nbe so ridiculous to see all his letters directed to him\\nwith an m.p.--but do you know, he says, he will never frank\\nfor me?  he declares he won\\'t.  don\\'t you, mr. palmer?\"\\n\\nmr. palmer took no notice of her.\\n\\n\"he cannot bear writing, you know,\" she continued--\\n\"he says it is quite shocking.\"\\n\\n\"no,\" said he, \"i never said any thing so irrational.\\ndon\\'t palm all your abuses of languages upon me.\"\\n\\n\"there now; you see how droll he is.  this is always\\nthe way with him!  sometimes he won\\'t speak to me for half\\na day together, and then he comes out with something\\nso droll--all about any thing in the world.\"\\n\\nshe surprised elinor very much as they returned\\ninto the drawing-room, by asking her whether she did\\nnot like mr. palmer excessively.\\n\\n\"certainly,\" said elinor; \"he seems very agreeable.\"\\n\\n\"well--i am so glad you do.  i thought you would,\\nhe is so pleasant; and mr. palmer is excessively pleased\\nwith you and your sisters i can tell you, and you can\\'t\\nthink how disappointed he will be if you don\\'t come\\nto cleveland.--i can\\'t imagine why you should object\\nto it.\"\\n\\nelinor was again obliged to decline her invitation;\\nand by changing the subject, put a stop to her entreaties.\\nshe thought it probable that as they lived in the\\nsame county, mrs. palmer might be able to give some\\nmore particular account of willoughby\\'s general\\ncharacter, than could be gathered from the middletons\\'\\npartial acquaintance with him; and she was eager to gain\\nfrom any one, such a confirmation of his merits as might\\nremove the possibility of fear from marianne.  she began\\nby inquiring if they saw much of mr. willoughby at cleveland,\\nand whether they were intimately acquainted with him.\\n\\n\"oh dear, yes; i know him extremely well,\"\\nreplied mrs. palmer;--\"not that i ever spoke\\nto him, indeed; but i have seen him for ever in town.\\nsomehow or other i never happened to be staying at barton\\nwhile he was at allenham.  mama saw him here once before;--\\nbut i was with my uncle at weymouth.  however, i dare say\\nwe should have seen a great deal of him in somersetshire,\\nif it had not happened very unluckily that we should never\\nhave been in the country together.  he is very little\\nat combe, i believe; but if he were ever so much there,\\ni do not think mr. palmer would visit him, for he is\\nin the opposition, you know, and besides it is such a\\nway off.  i know why you inquire about him, very well;\\nyour sister is to marry him.  i am monstrous glad of it,\\nfor then i shall have her for a neighbour you know.\"\\n\\n\"upon my word,\" replied elinor, \"you know much\\nmore of the matter than i do, if you have any reason\\nto expect such a match.\"\\n\\n\"don\\'t pretend to deny it, because you know it is\\nwhat every body talks of.  i assure you i heard of it\\nin my way through town.\"\\n\\n\"my dear mrs. palmer!\"\\n\\n\"upon my honour i did.--i met colonel brandon\\nmonday morning in bond-street, just before we left town,\\nand he told me of it directly.\"\\n\\n\"you surprise me very much.  colonel brandon tell\\nyou of it!  surely you must be mistaken.  to give such\\nintelligence to a person who could not be interested in it,\\neven if it were true, is not what i should expect colonel\\nbrandon to do.\"\\n\\n\"but i do assure you it was so, for all that,\\nand i will tell you how it happened.  when we met him,\\nhe turned back and walked with us; and so we began talking\\nof my brother and sister, and one thing and another,\\nand i said to him, \\'so, colonel, there is a new family\\ncome to barton cottage, i hear, and mama sends me word\\nthey are very pretty, and that one of them is going to be\\nmarried to mr. willoughby of combe magna.  is it true,\\npray? for of course you must know, as you have been in\\ndevonshire so lately.\\'\"\\n\\n\"and what did the colonel say?\"\\n\\n\"oh--he did not say much; but he looked as if he\\nknew it to be true, so from that moment i set it down\\nas certain.  it will be quite delightful, i declare!\\nwhen is it to take place?\"\\n\\n\"mr. brandon was very well i hope?\"\\n\\n\"oh! yes, quite well; and so full of your praises,\\nhe did nothing but say fine things of you.\"\\n\\n\"i am flattered by his commendation.  he seems\\nan excellent man; and i think him uncommonly pleasing.\"\\n\\n\"so do i.--he is such a charming man, that it\\nis quite a pity he should be so grave and so dull.\\nmamma says he was in love with your sister too.--\\ni assure you it was a great compliment if he was, for he\\nhardly ever falls in love with any body.\"\\n\\n\"is mr. willoughby much known in your part\\nof somersetshire?\" said elinor.\\n\\n\"oh! yes, extremely well; that is, i do not believe\\nmany people are acquainted with him, because combe magna\\nis so far off; but they all think him extremely agreeable\\ni assure you.  nobody is more liked than mr. willoughby\\nwherever he goes, and so you may tell your sister.\\nshe is a monstrous lucky girl to get him, upon my honour;\\nnot but that he is much more lucky in getting her,\\nbecause she is so very handsome and agreeable, that nothing\\ncan be good enough for her.  however, i don\\'t think\\nher hardly at all handsomer than you, i assure you;\\nfor i think you both excessively pretty, and so does\\nmr. palmer too i am sure, though we could not get him\\nto own it last night.\"\\n\\nmrs. palmer\\'s information respecting willoughby\\nwas not very material; but any testimony in his favour,\\nhowever small, was pleasing to her.\\n\\n\"i am so glad we are got acquainted at last,\"\\ncontinued charlotte.--\"and now i hope we shall always be\\ngreat friends.  you can\\'t think how much i longed to see you!\\nit is so delightful that you should live at the cottage!\\nnothing can be like it, to be sure!  and i am so glad\\nyour sister is going to be well married!  i hope you will\\nbe a great deal at combe magna.  it is a sweet place,\\nby all accounts.\"\\n\\n\"you have been long acquainted with colonel brandon,\\nhave not you?\"\\n\\n\"yes, a great while; ever since my sister married.--\\nhe was a particular friend of sir john\\'s. i believe,\"\\nshe added in a low voice, \"he would have been very\\nglad to have had me, if he could.  sir john and lady\\nmiddleton wished it very much.  but mama did not think\\nthe match good enough for me, otherwise sir john would\\nhave mentioned it to the colonel, and we should have been\\nmarried immediately.\"\\n\\n\"did not colonel brandon know of sir john\\'s proposal\\nto your mother before it was made?  had he never owned\\nhis affection to yourself?\"\\n\\n\"oh, no; but if mama had not objected to it,\\ni dare say he would have liked it of all things.\\nhe had not seen me then above twice, for it was before\\ni left school.  however, i am much happier as i am.\\nmr. palmer is the kind of man i like.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 21\\n\\n\\nthe palmers returned to cleveland the next day,\\nand the two families at barton were again left to entertain\\neach other.  but this did not last long; elinor had hardly\\ngot their last visitors out of her head, had hardly done\\nwondering at charlotte\\'s being so happy without a cause,\\nat mr. palmer\\'s acting so simply, with good abilities,\\nand at the strange unsuitableness which often existed between\\nhusband and wife, before sir john\\'s and mrs. jennings\\'s\\nactive zeal in the cause of society, procured her some\\nother new acquaintance to see and observe.\\n\\nin a morning\\'s excursion to exeter, they had met with\\ntwo young ladies, whom mrs. jennings had the satisfaction\\nof discovering to be her relations, and this was enough\\nfor sir john to invite them directly to the park,\\nas soon as their present engagements at exeter were over.\\ntheir engagements at exeter instantly gave way before\\nsuch an invitation, and lady middleton was thrown into\\nno little alarm on the return of sir john, by hearing\\nthat she was very soon to receive a visit from two girls\\nwhom she had never seen in her life, and of whose elegance,--\\nwhose tolerable gentility even, she could have no proof;\\nfor the assurances of her husband and mother on that subject\\nwent for nothing at all.  their being her relations too\\nmade it so much the worse; and mrs. jennings\\'s attempts\\nat consolation were therefore unfortunately founded,\\nwhen she advised her daughter not to care about their being\\nso fashionable; because they were all cousins and must put\\nup with one another.  as it was impossible, however, now to\\nprevent their coming, lady middleton resigned herself to the\\nidea of it, with all the philosophy of a well-bred woman,\\ncontenting herself with merely giving her husband a gentle\\nreprimand on the subject five or six times every day.\\n\\nthe young ladies arrived: their appearance was by\\nno means ungenteel or unfashionable.  their dress was\\nvery smart, their manners very civil, they were delighted\\nwith the house, and in raptures with the furniture,\\nand they happened to be so doatingly fond of children\\nthat lady middleton\\'s good opinion was engaged in their\\nfavour before they had been an hour at the park.\\nshe declared them to be very agreeable girls indeed,\\nwhich for her ladyship was enthusiastic admiration.\\nsir john\\'s confidence in his own judgment rose with this\\nanimated praise, and he set off directly for the cottage\\nto tell the miss dashwoods of the miss steeles\\' arrival,\\nand to assure them of their being the sweetest girls\\nin the world.  from such commendation as this, however,\\nthere was not much to be learned; elinor well knew\\nthat the sweetest girls in the world were to be met\\nwith in every part of england, under every possible\\nvariation of form, face, temper and understanding.\\nsir john wanted the whole family to walk to the park directly\\nand look at his guests.  benevolent, philanthropic man!  it\\nwas painful to him even to keep a third cousin to himself.\\n\\n\"do come now,\" said he--\"pray come--you must come--i\\ndeclare you shall come--you can\\'t think how you will\\nlike them.  lucy is monstrous pretty, and so good humoured\\nand agreeable!  the children are all hanging about her already,\\nas if she was an old acquaintance.  and they both long\\nto see you of all things, for they have heard at exeter\\nthat you are the most beautiful creatures in the world;\\nand i have told them it is all very true, and a great\\ndeal more.  you will be delighted with them i am sure.\\nthey have brought the whole coach full of playthings\\nfor the children.  how can you be so cross as not to come?\\nwhy they are your cousins, you know, after a fashion.\\nyou are my cousins, and they are my wife\\'s, so you must\\nbe related.\"\\n\\nbut sir john could not prevail.  he could only obtain\\na promise of their calling at the park within a day or two,\\nand then left them in amazement at their indifference,\\nto walk home and boast anew of their attractions to the\\nmiss steeles, as he had been already boasting of the miss\\nsteeles to them.\\n\\nwhen their promised visit to the park and consequent\\nintroduction to these young ladies took place, they found\\nin the appearance of the eldest, who was nearly thirty,\\nwith a very plain and not a sensible face, nothing to admire;\\nbut in the other, who was not more than two or three\\nand twenty, they acknowledged considerable beauty; her\\nfeatures were pretty, and she had a sharp quick eye,\\nand a smartness of air, which though it did not give\\nactual elegance or grace, gave distinction to her person.--\\ntheir manners were particularly civil, and elinor soon\\nallowed them credit for some kind of sense, when she\\nsaw with what constant and judicious attention they\\nwere making themselves agreeable to lady middleton.\\nwith her children they were in continual raptures,\\nextolling their beauty, courting their notice, and humouring\\ntheir whims; and such of their time as could be spared from\\nthe importunate demands which this politeness made on it,\\nwas spent in admiration of whatever her ladyship was doing,\\nif she happened to be doing any thing, or in taking patterns\\nof some elegant new dress, in which her appearance\\nthe day before had thrown them into unceasing delight.\\nfortunately for those who pay their court through\\nsuch foibles, a fond mother, though, in pursuit of praise\\nfor her children, the most rapacious of human beings,\\nis likewise the most credulous; her demands are exorbitant;\\nbut she will swallow any thing; and the excessive\\naffection and endurance of the miss steeles towards\\nher offspring were viewed therefore by lady middleton\\nwithout the smallest surprise or distrust.  she saw with\\nmaternal complacency all the impertinent encroachments\\nand mischievous tricks to which her cousins submitted.\\nshe saw their sashes untied, their hair pulled about\\ntheir ears, their work-bags searched, and their knives\\nand scissors stolen away, and felt no doubt of its being\\na reciprocal enjoyment.  it suggested no other surprise\\nthan that elinor and marianne should sit so composedly by,\\nwithout claiming a share in what was passing.\\n\\n\"john is in such spirits today!\" said she, on his\\ntaking miss steeles\\'s pocket handkerchief, and throwing\\nit out of window--\"he is full of monkey tricks.\"\\n\\nand soon afterwards, on the second boy\\'s violently\\npinching one of the same lady\\'s fingers, she fondly observed,\\n\"how playful william is!\"\\n\\n\"and here is my sweet little annamaria,\" she added,\\ntenderly caressing a little girl of three years old,\\nwho had not made a noise for the last two minutes;\\n\"and she is always so gentle and quiet--never was there\\nsuch a quiet little thing!\"\\n\\nbut unfortunately in bestowing these embraces,\\na pin in her ladyship\\'s head dress slightly scratching\\nthe child\\'s neck, produced from this pattern of gentleness\\nsuch violent screams, as could hardly be outdone by any\\ncreature professedly noisy.  the mother\\'s consternation\\nwas excessive; but it could not surpass the alarm of the\\nmiss steeles, and every thing was done by all three,\\nin so critical an emergency, which affection could suggest\\nas likely to assuage the agonies of the little sufferer.\\nshe was seated in her mother\\'s lap, covered with kisses,\\nher wound bathed with lavender-water, by one of the\\nmiss steeles, who was on her knees to attend her,\\nand her mouth stuffed with sugar plums by the other.\\nwith such a reward for her tears, the child was too wise\\nto cease crying.  she still screamed and sobbed lustily,\\nkicked her two brothers for offering to touch her, and all\\ntheir united soothings were ineffectual till lady middleton\\nluckily remembering that in a scene of similar distress\\nlast week, some apricot marmalade had been successfully\\napplied for a bruised temple, the same remedy was eagerly\\nproposed for this unfortunate scratch, and a slight\\nintermission of screams in the young lady on hearing it,\\ngave them reason to hope that it would not be rejected.--\\nshe was carried out of the room therefore in her\\nmother\\'s arms, in quest of this medicine, and as the\\ntwo boys chose to follow, though earnestly entreated\\nby their mother to stay behind, the four young ladies\\nwere left in a quietness which the room had not known for\\nmany hours.\\n\\n\"poor little creatures!\" said miss steele, as soon\\nas they were gone.  \"it might have been a very sad accident.\"\\n\\n\"yet i hardly know how,\" cried marianne, \"unless it\\nhad been under totally different circumstances.\\nbut this is the usual way of heightening alarm, where there\\nis nothing to be alarmed at in reality.\"\\n\\n\"what a sweet woman lady middleton is!\" said lucy steele.\\n\\nmarianne was silent; it was impossible for her to say\\nwhat she did not feel, however trivial the occasion;\\nand upon elinor therefore the whole task of telling lies\\nwhen politeness required it, always fell.  she did her\\nbest when thus called on, by speaking of lady middleton\\nwith more warmth than she felt, though with far less than\\nmiss lucy.\\n\\n\"and sir john too,\" cried the elder sister,\\n\"what a charming man he is!\"\\n\\nhere too, miss dashwood\\'s commendation, being only\\nsimple and just, came in without any eclat.  she merely\\nobserved that he was perfectly good humoured and friendly.\\n\\n\"and what a charming little family they have!  i\\nnever saw such fine children in my life.--i declare i\\nquite doat upon them already, and indeed i am always\\ndistractedly fond of children.\"\\n\\n\"i should guess so,\" said elinor, with a smile,\\n\"from what i have witnessed this morning.\"\\n\\n\"i have a notion,\" said lucy, \"you think the little\\nmiddletons rather too much indulged; perhaps they may be the\\noutside of enough; but it is so natural in lady middleton;\\nand for my part, i love to see children full of life\\nand spirits; i cannot bear them if they are tame and quiet.\"\\n\\n\"i confess,\" replied elinor, \"that while i am at\\nbarton park, i never think of tame and quiet children\\nwith any abhorrence.\"\\n\\na short pause succeeded this speech, which was first\\nbroken by miss steele, who seemed very much disposed\\nfor conversation, and who now said rather abruptly,\\n\"and how do you like devonshire, miss dashwood?  i suppose\\nyou were very sorry to leave sussex.\"\\n\\nin some surprise at the familiarity of this question,\\nor at least of the manner in which it was spoken,\\nelinor replied that she was.\\n\\n\"norland is a prodigious beautiful place, is not it?\"\\nadded miss steele.\\n\\n\"we have heard sir john admire it excessively,\"\\nsaid lucy, who seemed to think some apology necessary\\nfor the freedom of her sister.\\n\\n\"i think every one must admire it,\" replied elinor,\\n\"who ever saw the place; though it is not to be supposed\\nthat any one can estimate its beauties as we do.\"\\n\\n\"and had you a great many smart beaux there?  i\\nsuppose you have not so many in this part of the world;\\nfor my part, i think they are a vast addition always.\"\\n\\n\"but why should you think,\" said lucy, looking ashamed\\nof her sister, \"that there are not as many genteel young\\nmen in devonshire as sussex?\"\\n\\n\"nay, my dear, i\\'m sure i don\\'t pretend to say that there\\nan\\'t.  i\\'m sure there\\'s a vast many smart beaux in exeter;\\nbut you know, how could i tell what smart beaux there\\nmight be about norland; and i was only afraid the miss\\ndashwoods might find it dull at barton, if they had not\\nso many as they used to have.  but perhaps you young ladies\\nmay not care about the beaux, and had as lief be without\\nthem as with them.  for my part, i think they are vastly\\nagreeable, provided they dress smart and behave civil.\\nbut i can\\'t bear to see them dirty and nasty.  now there\\'s\\nmr. rose at exeter, a prodigious smart young man,\\nquite a beau, clerk to mr. simpson, you know, and yet if you\\ndo but meet him of a morning, he is not fit to be seen.--\\ni suppose your brother was quite a beau, miss dashwood,\\nbefore he married, as he was so rich?\"\\n\\n\"upon my word,\" replied elinor, \"i cannot tell you,\\nfor i do not perfectly comprehend the meaning of the word.\\nbut this i can say, that if he ever was a beau before\\nhe married, he is one still for there is not the smallest\\nalteration in him.\"\\n\\n\"oh! dear! one never thinks of married men\\'s being\\nbeaux--they have something else to do.\"\\n\\n\"lord! anne,\" cried her sister, \"you can talk of\\nnothing but beaux;--you will make miss dashwood believe you\\nthink of nothing else.\" and then to turn the discourse,\\nshe began admiring the house and the furniture.\\n\\nthis specimen of the miss steeles was enough.\\nthe vulgar freedom and folly of the eldest left\\nher no recommendation, and as elinor was not blinded\\nby the beauty, or the shrewd look of the youngest,\\nto her want of real elegance and artlessness, she left\\nthe house without any wish of knowing them better.\\n\\nnot so the miss steeles.--they came from exeter, well\\nprovided with admiration for the use of sir john middleton,\\nhis family, and all his relations, and no niggardly\\nproportion was now dealt out to his fair cousins, whom they\\ndeclared to be the most beautiful, elegant, accomplished,\\nand agreeable girls they had ever beheld, and with whom\\nthey were particularly anxious to be better acquainted.--\\nand to be better acquainted therefore, elinor soon found\\nwas their inevitable lot, for as sir john was entirely\\non the side of the miss steeles, their party would be\\ntoo strong for opposition, and that kind of intimacy\\nmust be submitted to, which consists of sitting an hour\\nor two together in the same room almost every day.\\nsir john could do no more; but he did not know that any\\nmore was required: to be together was, in his opinion,\\nto be intimate, and while his continual schemes for their\\nmeeting were effectual, he had not a doubt of their being\\nestablished friends.\\n\\nto do him justice, he did every thing in his power\\nto promote their unreserve, by making the miss steeles\\nacquainted with whatever he knew or supposed of his cousins\\'\\nsituations in the most delicate particulars,--and elinor\\nhad not seen them more than twice, before the eldest of\\nthem wished her joy on her sister\\'s having been so lucky\\nas to make a conquest of a very smart beau since she\\ncame to barton.\\n\\n\"\\'twill be a fine thing to have her married so young\\nto be sure,\" said she, \"and i hear he is quite a beau,\\nand prodigious handsome.  and i hope you may have as good\\nluck yourself soon,--but perhaps you may have a friend\\nin the corner already.\"\\n\\nelinor could not suppose that sir john would be more\\nnice in proclaiming his suspicions of her regard for edward,\\nthan he had been with respect to marianne; indeed it was\\nrather his favourite joke of the two, as being somewhat\\nnewer and more conjectural; and since edward\\'s visit,\\nthey had never dined together without his drinking to her\\nbest affections with so much significancy and so many nods\\nand winks, as to excite general attention.  the letter f--\\nhad been likewise invariably brought forward, and found\\nproductive of such countless jokes, that its character\\nas the wittiest letter in the alphabet had been long\\nestablished with elinor.\\n\\nthe miss steeles, as she expected, had now all the\\nbenefit of these jokes, and in the eldest of them they\\nraised a curiosity to know the name of the gentleman\\nalluded to, which, though often impertinently expressed,\\nwas perfectly of a piece with her general inquisitiveness\\ninto the concerns of their family.  but sir john did not\\nsport long with the curiosity which he delighted to raise,\\nfor he had at least as much pleasure in telling the name,\\nas miss steele had in hearing it.\\n\\n\"his name is ferrars,\" said he, in a very audible whisper;\\n\"but pray do not tell it, for it\\'s a great secret.\"\\n\\n\"ferrars!\" repeated miss steele; \"mr. ferrars is\\nthe happy man, is he? what! your sister-in-law\\'s brother,\\nmiss dashwood? a very agreeable young man to be sure;\\ni know him very well.\"\\n\\n\"how can you say so, anne?\" cried lucy, who generally\\nmade an amendment to all her sister\\'s assertions.\\n\"though we have seen him once or twice at my uncle\\'s, it\\nis rather too much to pretend to know him very well.\"\\n\\nelinor heard all this with attention and surprise.\\n\"and who was this uncle?  where did he live?  how came\\nthey acquainted?\"  she wished very much to have the subject\\ncontinued, though she did not chuse to join in it herself;\\nbut nothing more of it was said, and for the first time\\nin her life, she thought mrs. jennings deficient either\\nin curiosity after petty information, or in a disposition\\nto communicate it.  the manner in which miss steele had\\nspoken of edward, increased her curiosity; for it struck\\nher as being rather ill-natured, and suggested the suspicion\\nof that lady\\'s knowing, or fancying herself to know something\\nto his disadvantage.--but her curiosity was unavailing,\\nfor no farther notice was taken of mr. ferrars\\'s name by\\nmiss steele when alluded to, or even openly mentioned by sir\\njohn.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 22\\n\\n\\nmarianne, who had never much toleration for any\\nthing like impertinence, vulgarity, inferiority of parts,\\nor even difference of taste from herself, was at\\nthis time particularly ill-disposed, from the state\\nof her spirits, to be pleased with the miss steeles,\\nor to encourage their advances; and to the invariable\\ncoldness of her behaviour towards them, which checked every\\nendeavour at intimacy on their side, elinor principally\\nattributed that preference of herself which soon became\\nevident in the manners of both, but especially of lucy,\\nwho missed no opportunity of engaging her in conversation,\\nor of striving to improve their acquaintance by an easy\\nand frank communication of her sentiments.\\n\\nlucy was naturally clever; her remarks were often\\njust and amusing; and as a companion for half an hour\\nelinor frequently found her agreeable; but her powers\\nhad received no aid from education: she was ignorant\\nand illiterate; and her deficiency of all mental improvement,\\nher want of information in the most common particulars,\\ncould not be concealed from miss dashwood, in spite of her\\nconstant endeavour to appear to advantage.  elinor saw,\\nand pitied her for, the neglect of abilities which education\\nmight have rendered so respectable; but she saw, with less\\ntenderness of feeling, the thorough want of delicacy,\\nof rectitude, and integrity of mind, which her attentions,\\nher assiduities, her flatteries at the park betrayed;\\nand she could have no lasting satisfaction in the company\\nof a person who joined insincerity with ignorance;\\nwhose want of instruction prevented their meeting\\nin conversation on terms of equality, and whose conduct\\ntoward others made every shew of attention and deference\\ntowards herself perfectly valueless.\\n\\n\"you will think my question an odd one, i dare say,\"\\nsaid lucy to her one day, as they were walking together\\nfrom the park to the cottage--\"but pray, are you\\npersonally acquainted with your sister-in-law\\'s mother,\\nmrs. ferrars?\"\\n\\nelinor did think the question a very odd one,\\nand her countenance expressed it, as she answered that she\\nhad never seen mrs. ferrars.\\n\\n\"indeed!\" replied lucy; \"i wonder at that, for i\\nthought you must have seen her at norland sometimes.\\nthen, perhaps, you cannot tell me what sort of a woman\\nshe is?\"\\n\\n\"no,\" returned elinor, cautious of giving her real\\nopinion of edward\\'s mother, and not very desirous\\nof satisfying what seemed impertinent curiosity--\\n\"i know nothing of her.\"\\n\\n\"i am sure you think me very strange, for enquiring\\nabout her in such a way,\" said lucy, eyeing elinor attentively\\nas she spoke; \"but perhaps there may be reasons--i wish\\ni might venture; but however i hope you will do me the justice\\nof believing that i do not mean to be impertinent.\"\\n\\nelinor made her a civil reply, and they walked on\\nfor a few minutes in silence.  it was broken by lucy,\\nwho renewed the subject again by saying, with some\\nhesitation,\\n\\n\"i cannot bear to have you think me impertinently curious.\\ni am sure i would rather do any thing in the world than be\\nthought so by a person whose good opinion is so well worth\\nhaving as yours.  and i am sure i should not have the smallest\\nfear of trusting you; indeed, i should be very glad of your\\nadvice how to manage in such and uncomfortable situation\\nas i am; but, however, there is no occasion to trouble you.\\ni am sorry you do not happen to know mrs. ferrars.\"\\n\\n\"i am sorry i do not,\" said elinor, in great astonishment,\\n\"if it could be of any use to you to know my opinion of her.\\nbut really i never understood that you were at all connected\\nwith that family, and therefore i am a little surprised,\\ni confess, at so serious an inquiry into her character.\"\\n\\n\"i dare say you are, and i am sure i do not at all\\nwonder at it.  but if i dared tell you all, you would not be\\nso much surprised.  mrs. ferrars is certainly nothing to me\\nat present--but the time may come--how soon it will come\\nmust depend upon herself--when we may be very intimately\\nconnected.\"\\n\\nshe looked down as she said this, amiably bashful,\\nwith only one side glance at her companion to observe its\\neffect on her.\\n\\n\"good heavens!\" cried elinor, \"what do you mean?\\nare you acquainted with mr. robert ferrars?  can you be?\"\\nand she did not feel much delighted with the idea of such\\na sister-in-law.\\n\\n\"no,\" replied lucy, \"not to mr. robert ferrars--i\\nnever saw him in my life; but,\" fixing her eyes upon elinor,\\n\"to his eldest brother.\"\\n\\nwhat felt elinor at that moment? astonishment,\\nthat would have been as painful as it was strong, had not\\nan immediate disbelief of the assertion attended it.\\nshe turned towards lucy in silent amazement, unable to divine\\nthe reason or object of such a declaration; and though\\nher complexion varied, she stood firm in incredulity,\\nand felt in no danger of an hysterical fit, or a swoon.\\n\\n\"you may well be surprised,\" continued lucy;\\n\"for to be sure you could have had no idea of it before;\\nfor i dare say he never dropped the smallest hint of it\\nto you or any of your family; because it was always meant\\nto be a great secret, and i am sure has been faithfully\\nkept so by me to this hour.  not a soul of all my relations\\nknow of it but anne, and i never should have mentioned\\nit to you, if i had not felt the greatest dependence\\nin the world upon your secrecy; and i really thought my\\nbehaviour in asking so many questions about mrs. ferrars\\nmust seem so odd, that it ought to be explained.\\nand i do not think mr. ferrars can be displeased,\\nwhen he knows i have trusted you, because i know he has\\nthe highest opinion in the world of all your family,\\nand looks upon yourself and the other miss dashwoods quite\\nas his own sisters.\"--she paused.\\n\\nelinor for a few moments remained silent.\\nher astonishment at what she heard was at first too\\ngreat for words; but at length forcing herself to speak,\\nand to speak cautiously, she said, with calmness of manner,\\nwhich tolerably well concealed her surprise and solicitude--\\n\"may i ask if your engagement is of long standing?\"\\n\\n\"we have been engaged these four years.\"\\n\\n\"four years!\"\\n\\n\"yes.\"\\n\\nelinor, though greatly shocked, still felt unable\\nto believe it.\\n\\n\"i did not know,\" said she, \"that you were even\\nacquainted till the other day.\"\\n\\n\"our acquaintance, however, is of many years date.\\nhe was under my uncle\\'s care, you know, a considerable while.\"\\n\\n\"your uncle!\"\\n\\n\"yes; mr. pratt.  did you never hear him talk\\nof mr. pratt?\"\\n\\n\"i think i have,\" replied elinor, with an exertion\\nof spirits, which increased with her increase of emotion.\\n\\n\"he was four years with my uncle, who lives at longstaple,\\nnear plymouth.  it was there our acquaintance begun,\\nfor my sister and me was often staying with my uncle,\\nand it was there our engagement was formed, though not till\\na year after he had quitted as a pupil; but he was almost\\nalways with us afterwards.  i was very unwilling to enter\\ninto it, as you may imagine, without the knowledge and\\napprobation of his mother; but i was too young, and loved\\nhim too well, to be so prudent as i ought to have been.--\\nthough you do not know him so well as me, miss dashwood,\\nyou must have seen enough of him to be sensible he is\\nvery capable of making a woman sincerely attached to him.\"\\n\\n\"certainly,\" answered elinor, without knowing what\\nshe said; but after a moment\\'s reflection, she added,\\nwith revived security of edward\\'s honour and love,\\nand her companion\\'s falsehood--\"engaged to mr. edward\\nferrars!--i confess myself so totally surprised at\\nwhat you tell me, that really--i beg your pardon;\\nbut surely there must be some mistake of person or name.\\nwe cannot mean the same mr. ferrars.\"\\n\\n\"we can mean no other,\" cried lucy, smiling.  \"mr. edward\\nferrars, the eldest son of mrs. ferrars, of park street,\\nand brother of your sister-in-law, mrs. john dashwood,\\nis the person i mean; you must allow that i am not likely\\nto be deceived as to the name of the man on who all my happiness\\ndepends.\"\\n\\n\"it is strange,\" replied elinor, in a most painful perplexity,\\n\"that i should never have heard him even mention your name.\"\\n\\n\"no; considering our situation, it was not strange.\\nour first care has been to keep the matter secret.--\\nyou knew nothing of me, or my family, and, therefore,\\nthere could be no occasion for ever mentioning my name\\nto you; and, as he was always particularly afraid of his\\nsister\\'s suspecting any thing, that was reason enough\\nfor his not mentioning it.\"\\n\\nshe was silent.--elinor\\'s security sunk; but her\\nself-command did not sink with it.\\n\\n\"four years you have been engaged,\" said she\\nwith a firm voice.\\n\\n\"yes; and heaven knows how much longer we may have\\nto wait.  poor edward!  it puts him quite out of heart.\"\\nthen taking a small miniature from her pocket, she added,\\n\"to prevent the possibility of mistake, be so good as to look\\nat this face.  it does not do him justice, to be sure,\\nbut yet i think you cannot be deceived as to the person\\nit was drew for.--i have had it above these three years.\"\\n\\nshe put it into her hands as she spoke; and when elinor\\nsaw the painting, whatever other doubts her fear of a\\ntoo hasty decision, or her wish of detecting falsehood\\nmight suffer to linger in her mind, she could have none of\\nits being edward\\'s face.  she returned it almost instantly,\\nacknowledging the likeness.\\n\\n\"i have never been able,\" continued lucy, \"to give\\nhim my picture in return, which i am very much vexed at,\\nfor he has been always so anxious to get it!  but i am\\ndetermined to set for it the very first opportunity.\"\\n\\n\"you are quite in the right,\" replied elinor calmly.\\nthey then proceeded a few paces in silence.  lucy spoke first.\\n\\n\"i am sure,\" said she, \"i have no doubt in the world\\nof your faithfully keeping this secret, because you must\\nknow of what importance it is to us, not to have it reach\\nhis mother; for she would never approve of it, i dare say.\\ni shall have no fortune, and i fancy she is an exceeding\\nproud woman.\"\\n\\n\"i certainly did not seek your confidence,\" said elinor;\\n\"but you do me no more than justice in imagining that i\\nmay be depended on.  your secret is safe with me;\\nbut pardon me if i express some surprise at so unnecessary\\na communication.  you must at least have felt that my\\nbeing acquainted with it could not add to its safety.\"\\n\\nas she said this, she looked earnestly at lucy,\\nhoping to discover something in her countenance; perhaps the\\nfalsehood of the greatest part of what she had been saying;\\nbut lucy\\'s countenance suffered no change.\\n\\n\"i was afraid you would think i was taking a great\\nliberty with you,\" said she, \"in telling you all this.\\ni have not known you long to be sure, personally at least,\\nbut i have known you and all your family by description\\na great while; and as soon as i saw you, i felt almost as if\\nyou was an old acquaintance.  besides in the present case,\\ni really thought some explanation was due to you after my\\nmaking such particular inquiries about edward\\'s mother;\\nand i am so unfortunate, that i have not a creature whose\\nadvice i can ask.  anne is the only person that knows of it,\\nand she has no judgment at all; indeed, she does me a great\\ndeal more harm than good, for i am in constant fear of her\\nbetraying me.  she does not know how to hold her tongue,\\nas you must perceive, and i am sure i was in the greatest\\nfright in the world t\\'other day, when edward\\'s name was\\nmentioned by sir john, lest she should out with it all.\\nyou can\\'t think how much i go through in my mind from\\nit altogether.  i only wonder that i am alive after what\\ni have suffered for edward\\'s sake these last four years.\\nevery thing in such suspense and uncertainty; and seeing\\nhim so seldom--we can hardly meet above twice a-year.\\ni am sure i wonder my heart is not quite broke.\"\\n\\nhere she took out her handkerchief; but elinor did\\nnot feel very compassionate.\\n\\n\"sometimes.\" continued lucy, after wiping her eyes,\\n\"i think whether it would not be better for us both\\nto break off the matter entirely.\"  as she said this,\\nshe looked directly at her companion.  \"but then\\nat other times i have not resolution enough for it.--\\ni cannot bear the thoughts of making him so miserable,\\nas i know the very mention of such a thing would do.\\nand on my own account too--so dear as he is to me--i don\\'t\\nthink i could be equal to it.  what would you advise\\nme to do in such a case, miss dashwood?  what would you\\ndo yourself?\"\\n\\n\"pardon me,\" replied elinor, startled by the question;\\n\"but i can give you no advice under such circumstances.\\nyour own judgment must direct you.\"\\n\\n\"to be sure,\" continued lucy, after a few minutes\\nsilence on both sides, \"his mother must provide for him\\nsometime or other; but poor edward is so cast down by it!\\ndid you not think him dreadful low-spirited when he was at\\nbarton?  he was so miserable when he left us at longstaple,\\nto go to you, that i was afraid you would think him quite ill.\"\\n\\n\"did he come from your uncle\\'s, then, when he visited us?\"\\n\\n\"oh, yes; he had been staying a fortnight with us.\\ndid you think he came directly from town?\"\\n\\n\"no,\" replied elinor, most feelingly sensible of\\nevery fresh circumstance in favour of lucy\\'s veracity;\\n\"i remember he told us, that he had been staying\\na fortnight with some friends near plymouth.\"\\nshe remembered too, her own surprise at the time,\\nat his mentioning nothing farther of those friends,\\nat his total silence with respect even to their names.\\n\\n\"did not you think him sadly out of spirits?\"\\nrepeated lucy.\\n\\n\"we did, indeed, particularly so when he first arrived.\"\\n\\n\"i begged him to exert himself for fear you\\nshould suspect what was the matter; but it made him\\nso melancholy, not being able to stay more than a\\nfortnight with us, and seeing me so much affected.--\\npoor fellow!--i am afraid it is just the same with him now;\\nfor he writes in wretched spirits.  i heard from him just\\nbefore i left exeter;\" taking a letter from her pocket\\nand carelessly showing the direction to elinor.\\n\"you know his hand, i dare say, a charming one it is;\\nbut that is not written so well as usual.--he was tired,\\ni dare say, for he had just filled the sheet to me as full\\nas possible.\"\\n\\nelinor saw that it was his hand, and she could doubt\\nno longer.  this picture, she had allowed herself to believe,\\nmight have been accidentally obtained; it might not have\\nbeen edward\\'s gift; but a correspondence between them\\nby letter, could subsist only under a positive engagement,\\ncould be authorised by nothing else; for a few moments, she\\nwas almost overcome--her heart sunk within her, and she could\\nhardly stand; but exertion was indispensably necessary;\\nand she struggled so resolutely against the oppression\\nof her feelings, that her success was speedy, and for\\nthe time complete.\\n\\n\"writing to each other,\" said lucy, returning the\\nletter into her pocket, \"is the only comfort we have\\nin such long separations.  yes, i have one other comfort\\nin his picture, but poor edward has not even that.\\nif he had but my picture, he says he should be easy.\\ni gave him a lock of my hair set in a ring when he was at\\nlongstaple last, and that was some comfort to him, he said,\\nbut not equal to a picture.  perhaps you might notice\\nthe ring when you saw him?\"\\n\\n\"i did,\" said elinor, with a composure of voice,\\nunder which was concealed an emotion and distress beyond\\nany thing she had ever felt before.  she was mortified,\\nshocked, confounded.\\n\\nfortunately for her, they had now reached the cottage,\\nand the conversation could be continued no farther.\\nafter sitting with them a few minutes, the miss steeles\\nreturned to the park, and elinor was then at liberty\\nto think and be wretched.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[at this point in the first and second editions, volume 1 ends.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 23\\n\\n\\nhowever small elinor\\'s general dependence on\\nlucy\\'s veracity might be, it was impossible for her\\non serious reflection to suspect it in the present case,\\nwhere no temptation could be answerable to the folly\\nof inventing a falsehood of such a description.  what lucy\\nhad asserted to be true, therefore, elinor could not,\\ndared not longer doubt; supported as it was too on every\\nside by such probabilities and proofs, and contradicted\\nby nothing but her own wishes.  their opportunity of\\nacquaintance in the house of mr. pratt was a foundation\\nfor the rest, at once indisputable and alarming; and edward\\'s\\nvisit near plymouth, his melancholy state of mind,\\nhis dissatisfaction at his own prospects, his uncertain\\nbehaviour towards herself, the intimate knowledge of the\\nmiss steeles as to norland and their family connections,\\nwhich had often surprised her, the picture, the letter,\\nthe ring, formed altogether such a body of evidence,\\nas overcame every fear of condemning him unfairly,\\nand established as a fact, which no partiality could\\nset aside, his ill-treatment of herself.--her resentment\\nof such behaviour, her indignation at having been its dupe,\\nfor a short time made her feel only for herself;\\nbut other ideas, other considerations, soon arose.\\nhad edward been intentionally deceiving her?  had he feigned\\na regard for her which he did not feel?  was his engagement\\nto lucy an engagement of the heart?  no; whatever it might\\nonce have been, she could not believe it such at present.\\nhis affection was all her own.  she could not be deceived\\nin that.  her mother, sisters, fanny, all had been\\nconscious of his regard for her at norland; it was not\\nan illusion of her own vanity.  he certainly loved her.\\nwhat a softener of the heart was this persuasion!  how much\\ncould it not tempt her to forgive!  he had been blamable,\\nhighly blamable, in remaining at norland after he first\\nfelt her influence over him to be more than it ought\\nto be.  in that, he could not be defended; but if he\\nhad injured her, how much more had he injured himself;\\nif her case were pitiable, his was hopeless.\\nhis imprudence had made her miserable for a while; but it\\nseemed to have deprived himself of all chance of ever\\nbeing otherwise.  she might in time regain tranquillity;\\nbut he, what had he to look forward to?  could he\\never be tolerably happy with lucy steele; could he,\\nwere his affection for herself out of the question,\\nwith his integrity, his delicacy, and well-informed mind,\\nbe satisfied with a wife like her--illiterate, artful,\\nand selfish?\\n\\nthe youthful infatuation of nineteen would naturally\\nblind him to every thing but her beauty and good nature;\\nbut the four succeeding years--years, which if rationally\\nspent, give such improvement to the understanding, must\\nhave opened his eyes to her defects of education,\\nwhile the same period of time, spent on her side\\nin inferior society and more frivolous pursuits,\\nhad perhaps robbed her of that simplicity which might\\nonce have given an interesting character to her beauty.\\n\\nif in the supposition of his seeking to marry herself,\\nhis difficulties from his mother had seemed great,\\nhow much greater were they now likely to be, when\\nthe object of his engagement was undoubtedly inferior\\nin connections, and probably inferior in fortune to herself.\\nthese difficulties, indeed, with a heart so alienated\\nfrom lucy, might not press very hard upon his patience;\\nbut melancholy was the state of the person by whom the\\nexpectation of family opposition and unkindness, could\\nbe felt as a relief!\\n\\nas these considerations occurred to her in painful\\nsuccession, she wept for him, more than for herself.\\nsupported by the conviction of having done nothing to\\nmerit her present unhappiness, and consoled by the belief\\nthat edward had done nothing to forfeit her esteem,\\nshe thought she could even now, under the first smart\\nof the heavy blow, command herself enough to guard every\\nsuspicion of the truth from her mother and sisters.\\nand so well was she able to answer her own expectations,\\nthat when she joined them at dinner only two hours\\nafter she had first suffered the extinction of all her\\ndearest hopes, no one would have supposed from the\\nappearance of the sisters, that elinor was mourning\\nin secret over obstacles which must divide her for ever\\nfrom the object of her love, and that marianne was\\ninternally dwelling on the perfections of a man, of whose\\nwhole heart she felt thoroughly possessed, and whom she\\nexpected to see in every carriage which drove near their house.\\n\\nthe necessity of concealing from her mother and\\nmarianne, what had been entrusted in confidence to herself,\\nthough it obliged her to unceasing exertion, was no\\naggravation of elinor\\'s distress.  on the contrary\\nit was a relief to her, to be spared the communication\\nof what would give such affliction to them, and to be\\nsaved likewise from hearing that condemnation of edward,\\nwhich would probably flow from the excess of their partial\\naffection for herself, and which was more than she felt\\nequal to support.\\n\\nfrom their counsel, or their conversation, she knew\\nshe could receive no assistance, their tenderness and\\nsorrow must add to her distress, while her self-command\\nwould neither receive encouragement from their example\\nnor from their praise.  she was stronger alone,\\nand her own good sense so well supported her, that her\\nfirmness was as unshaken, her appearance of cheerfulness\\nas invariable, as with regrets so poignant and so fresh,\\nit was possible for them to be.\\n\\nmuch as she had suffered from her first conversation\\nwith lucy on the subject, she soon felt an earnest wish\\nof renewing it; and this for more reasons than one.\\nshe wanted to hear many particulars of their engagement\\nrepeated again, she wanted more clearly to understand\\nwhat lucy really felt for edward, whether there were any\\nsincerity in her declaration of tender regard for him,\\nand she particularly wanted to convince lucy, by her\\nreadiness to enter on the matter again, and her calmness\\nin conversing on it, that she was no otherwise interested\\nin it than as a friend, which she very much feared\\nher involuntary agitation, in their morning discourse,\\nmust have left at least doubtful.  that lucy was disposed\\nto be jealous of her appeared very probable: it was plain\\nthat edward had always spoken highly in her praise,\\nnot merely from lucy\\'s assertion, but from her venturing\\nto trust her on so short a personal acquaintance,\\nwith a secret so confessedly and evidently important.\\nand even sir john\\'s joking intelligence must have had\\nsome weight.  but indeed, while elinor remained so well\\nassured within herself of being really beloved by edward,\\nit required no other consideration of probabilities\\nto make it natural that lucy should be jealous;\\nand that she was so, her very confidence was a proof.\\nwhat other reason for the disclosure of the affair could\\nthere be, but that elinor might be informed by it of lucy\\'s\\nsuperior claims on edward, and be taught to avoid him\\nin future?  she had little difficulty in understanding thus\\nmuch of her rival\\'s intentions, and while she was firmly\\nresolved to act by her as every principle of honour and\\nhonesty directed, to combat her own affection for edward\\nand to see him as little as possible; she could not deny\\nherself the comfort of endeavouring to convince lucy\\nthat her heart was unwounded.  and as she could now have\\nnothing more painful to hear on the subject than had already\\nbeen told, she did not mistrust her own ability of going\\nthrough a repetition of particulars with composure.\\n\\nbut it was not immediately that an opportunity\\nof doing so could be commanded, though lucy was as well\\ndisposed as herself to take advantage of any that occurred;\\nfor the weather was not often fine enough to allow\\nof their joining in a walk, where they might most easily\\nseparate themselves from the others; and though they\\nmet at least every other evening either at the park\\nor cottage, and chiefly at the former, they could\\nnot be supposed to meet for the sake of conversation.\\nsuch a thought would never enter either sir john or lady\\nmiddleton\\'s head; and therefore very little leisure\\nwas ever given for a general chat, and none at all for\\nparticular discourse.  they met for the sake of eating,\\ndrinking, and laughing together, playing at cards,\\nor consequences, or any other game that was sufficiently noisy.\\n\\none or two meetings of this kind had taken place,\\nwithout affording elinor any chance of engaging lucy\\nin private, when sir john called at the cottage one morning,\\nto beg, in the name of charity, that they would all\\ndine with lady middleton that day, as he was obliged\\nto attend the club at exeter, and she would otherwise be\\nquite alone, except her mother and the two miss steeles.\\nelinor, who foresaw a fairer opening for the point she\\nhad in view, in such a party as this was likely to be,\\nmore at liberty among themselves under the tranquil\\nand well-bred direction of lady middleton than when\\nher husband united them together in one noisy purpose,\\nimmediately accepted the invitation; margaret, with her\\nmother\\'s permission, was equally compliant, and marianne,\\nthough always unwilling to join any of their parties,\\nwas persuaded by her mother, who could not bear to have her\\nseclude herself from any chance of amusement, to go likewise.\\n\\nthe young ladies went, and lady middleton was happily\\npreserved from the frightful solitude which had threatened her.\\nthe insipidity of the meeting was exactly such as elinor\\nhad expected; it produced not one novelty of thought\\nor expression, and nothing could be less interesting\\nthan the whole of their discourse both in the dining\\nparlour and drawing room: to the latter, the children\\naccompanied them, and while they remained there, she was\\ntoo well convinced of the impossibility of engaging lucy\\'s\\nattention to attempt it.  they quitted it only with the\\nremoval of the tea-things.  the card-table was then placed,\\nand elinor began to wonder at herself for having ever\\nentertained a hope of finding time for conversation\\nat the park.  they all rose up in preparation for a round game.\\n\\n\"i am glad,\" said lady middleton to lucy,\\n\"you are not going to finish poor little annamaria\\'s\\nbasket this evening; for i am sure it must hurt your\\neyes to work filigree by candlelight.  and we will make\\nthe dear little love some amends for her disappointment\\nto-morrow, and then i hope she will not much mind it.\"\\n\\nthis hint was enough, lucy recollected herself instantly\\nand replied, \"indeed you are very much mistaken,\\nlady middleton; i am only waiting to know whether you can\\nmake your party without me, or i should have been at my\\nfiligree already.  i would not disappoint the little angel\\nfor all the world: and if you want me at the card-table now,\\ni am resolved to finish the basket after supper.\"\\n\\n\"you are very good, i hope it won\\'t hurt your eyes--\\nwill you ring the bell for some working candles?\\nmy poor little girl would be sadly disappointed, i know,\\nif the basket was not finished tomorrow, for though i\\ntold her it certainly would not, i am sure she depends\\nupon having it done.\"\\n\\nlucy directly drew her work table near her\\nand reseated herself with an alacrity and cheerfulness\\nwhich seemed to infer that she could taste no greater\\ndelight than in making a filigree basket for a spoilt child.\\n\\nlady middleton proposed a rubber of casino to the others.\\nno one made any objection but marianne, who with her usual\\ninattention to the forms of general civility, exclaimed,\\n\"your ladyship will have the goodness to excuse me--you\\nknow i detest cards.  i shall go to the piano-forte;\\ni have not touched it since it was tuned.\"  and without\\nfarther ceremony, she turned away and walked to the instrument.\\n\\nlady middleton looked as if she thanked heaven\\nthat she had never made so rude a speech.\\n\\n\"marianne can never keep long from that instrument\\nyou know, ma\\'am,\" said elinor, endeavouring to smooth\\naway the offence; \"and i do not much wonder at it; for it\\nis the very best toned piano-forte i ever heard.\"\\n\\nthe remaining five were now to draw their cards.\\n\\n\"perhaps,\" continued elinor, \"if i should happen\\nto cut out, i may be of some use to miss lucy steele,\\nin rolling her papers for her; and there is so much still\\nto be done to the basket, that it must be impossible\\ni think for her labour singly, to finish it this evening.\\ni should like the work exceedingly, if she would allow\\nme a share in it.\"\\n\\n\"indeed i shall be very much obliged to you\\nfor your help,\" cried lucy, \"for i find there is more\\nto be done to it than i thought there was; and it would\\nbe a shocking thing to disappoint dear annamaria after all.\"\\n\\n\"oh! that would be terrible, indeed,\" said miss steele--\\n\"dear little soul, how i do love her!\"\\n\\n\"you are very kind,\" said lady middleton to elinor;\\n\"and as you really like the work, perhaps you will be\\nas well pleased not to cut in till another rubber,\\nor will you take your chance now?\"\\n\\nelinor joyfully profited by the first of these proposals,\\nand thus by a little of that address which marianne\\ncould never condescend to practise, gained her own end,\\nand pleased lady middleton at the same time.  lucy made room\\nfor her with ready attention, and the two fair rivals were\\nthus seated side by side at the same table, and, with the\\nutmost harmony, engaged in forwarding the same work.\\nthe pianoforte at which marianne, wrapped up in her own\\nmusic and her own thoughts, had by this time forgotten\\nthat any body was in the room besides herself, was luckily\\nso near them that miss dashwood now judged she might safely,\\nunder the shelter of its noise, introduce the interesting\\nsubject, without any risk of being heard at the card-table.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 24\\n\\n\\nin a firm, though cautious tone, elinor thus began.\\n\\n\"i should be undeserving of the confidence you have\\nhonoured me with, if i felt no desire for its continuance,\\nor no farther curiosity on its subject.  i will\\nnot apologize therefore for bringing it forward again.\"\\n\\n\"thank you,\" cried lucy warmly, \"for breaking\\nthe ice; you have set my heart at ease by it; for i was\\nsomehow or other afraid i had offended you by what i\\ntold you that monday.\"\\n\\n\"offended me! how could you suppose so? believe me,\"\\nand elinor spoke it with the truest sincerity,\\n\"nothing could be farther from my intention than to give\\nyou such an idea.  could you have a motive for the trust,\\nthat was not honourable and flattering to me?\"\\n\\n\"and yet i do assure you,\" replied lucy, her little\\nsharp eyes full of meaning, \"there seemed to me to be\\na coldness and displeasure in your manner that made me\\nquite uncomfortable.  i felt sure that you was angry with me;\\nand have been quarrelling with myself ever since, for having\\ntook such a liberty as to trouble you with my affairs.\\nbut i am very glad to find it was only my own fancy,\\nand that you really do not blame me.  if you knew what a\\nconsolation it was to me to relieve my heart speaking to you\\nof what i am always thinking of every moment of my life,\\nyour compassion would make you overlook every thing else\\ni am sure.\"\\n\\n\"indeed, i can easily believe that it was a very great\\nrelief to you, to acknowledge your situation to me, and be\\nassured that you shall never have reason to repent it.\\nyour case is a very unfortunate one; you seem to me to\\nbe surrounded with difficulties, and you will have need\\nof all your mutual affection to support you under them.\\nmr. ferrars, i believe, is entirely dependent on his mother.\"\\n\\n\"he has only two thousand pounds of his own; it would\\nbe madness to marry upon that, though for my own part,\\ni could give up every prospect of more without a sigh.\\ni have been always used to a very small income, and could\\nstruggle with any poverty for him; but i love him too well\\nto be the selfish means of robbing him, perhaps, of all that\\nhis mother might give him if he married to please her.\\nwe must wait, it may be for many years.  with almost every\\nother man in the world, it would be an alarming prospect;\\nbut edward\\'s affection and constancy nothing can deprive me of\\ni know.\"\\n\\n\"that conviction must be every thing to you;\\nand he is undoubtedly supported by the same trust in your\\'s.\\nif the strength of your reciprocal attachment had failed,\\nas between many people, and under many circumstances\\nit naturally would during a four years\\' engagement,\\nyour situation would have been pitiable, indeed.\"\\n\\nlucy here looked up; but elinor was careful\\nin guarding her countenance from every expression\\nthat could give her words a suspicious tendency.\\n\\n\"edward\\'s love for me,\" said lucy, \"has been pretty\\nwell put to the test, by our long, very long absence\\nsince we were first engaged, and it has stood the trial\\nso well, that i should be unpardonable to doubt it now.\\ni can safely say that he has never gave me one moment\\'s\\nalarm on that account from the first.\"\\n\\nelinor hardly knew whether to smile or sigh\\nat this assertion.\\n\\nlucy went on.  \"i am rather of a jealous temper too\\nby nature, and from our different situations in life,\\nfrom his being so much more in the world than me, and our\\ncontinual separation, i was enough inclined for suspicion,\\nto have found out the truth in an instant, if there had been\\nthe slightest alteration in his behaviour to me when we met,\\nor any lowness of spirits that i could not account for,\\nor if he had talked more of one lady than another,\\nor seemed in any respect less happy at longstaple than he\\nused to be.  i do not mean to say that i am particularly\\nobservant or quick-sighted in general, but in such a case\\ni am sure i could not be deceived.\"\\n\\n\"all this,\" thought elinor, \"is very pretty;\\nbut it can impose upon neither of us.\"\\n\\n\"but what,\" said she after a short silence,\\n\"are your views? or have you none but that of waiting for\\nmrs. ferrars\\'s death, which is a melancholy and shocking\\nextremity?--is her son determined to submit to this,\\nand to all the tediousness of the many years of suspense\\nin which it may involve you, rather than run the risk\\nof her displeasure for a while by owning the truth?\"\\n\\n\"if we could be certain that it would be only\\nfor a while!  but mrs. ferrars is a very headstrong\\nproud woman, and in her first fit of anger upon hearing\\nit, would very likely secure every thing to robert,\\nand the idea of that, for edward\\'s sake, frightens away\\nall my inclination for hasty measures.\"\\n\\n\"and for your own sake too, or you are carrying\\nyour disinterestedness beyond reason.\"\\n\\nlucy looked at elinor again, and was silent.\\n\\n\"do you know mr. robert ferrars?\" asked elinor.\\n\\n\"not at all--i never saw him; but i fancy he\\nis very unlike his brother--silly and a great coxcomb.\"\\n\\n\"a great coxcomb!\" repeated miss steele, whose ear had\\ncaught those words by a sudden pause in marianne\\'s music.--\\n\"oh, they are talking of their favourite beaux, i dare say.\"\\n\\n\"no sister,\" cried lucy, \"you are mistaken there, our\\nfavourite beaux are not great coxcombs.\"\\n\\n\"i can answer for it that miss dashwood\\'s is not,\"\\nsaid mrs. jennings, laughing heartily; \"for he is one\\nof the modestest, prettiest behaved young men i ever saw;\\nbut as for lucy, she is such a sly little creature,\\nthere is no finding out who she likes.\"\\n\\n\"oh,\" cried miss steele, looking significantly round\\nat them, \"i dare say lucy\\'s beau is quite as modest\\nand pretty behaved as miss dashwood\\'s.\"\\n\\nelinor blushed in spite of herself.  lucy bit her lip,\\nand looked angrily at her sister.  a mutual silence took\\nplace for some time.  lucy first put an end to it by saying\\nin a lower tone, though marianne was then giving them\\nthe powerful protection of a very magnificent concerto--\\n\\n\"i will honestly tell you of one scheme which has\\nlately come into my head, for bringing matters to bear;\\nindeed i am bound to let you into the secret, for you\\nare a party concerned.  i dare say you have seen enough\\nof edward to know that he would prefer the church to every\\nother profession; now my plan is that he should take\\norders as soon as he can, and then through your interest,\\nwhich i am sure you would be kind enough to use out of\\nfriendship for him, and i hope out of some regard to me,\\nyour brother might be persuaded to give him norland living;\\nwhich i understand is a very good one, and the present\\nincumbent not likely to live a great while.  that would\\nbe enough for us to marry upon, and we might trust to time\\nand chance for the rest.\"\\n\\n\"i should always be happy,\" replied elinor, \"to show\\nany mark of my esteem and friendship for mr. ferrars;\\nbut do you not perceive that my interest on such an\\noccasion would be perfectly unnecessary?  he is brother\\nto mrs. john dashwood--that must be recommendation enough\\nto her husband.\"\\n\\n\"but mrs. john dashwood would not much approve\\nof edward\\'s going into orders.\"\\n\\n\"then i rather suspect that my interest would\\ndo very little.\"\\n\\nthey were again silent for many minutes.  at length\\nlucy exclaimed with a deep sigh,\\n\\n\"i believe it would be the wisest way to put an end\\nto the business at once by dissolving the engagement.\\nwe seem so beset with difficulties on every side,\\nthat though it would make us miserable for a time,\\nwe should be happier perhaps in the end.  but you will\\nnot give me your advice, miss dashwood?\"\\n\\n\"no,\" answered elinor, with a smile, which concealed\\nvery agitated feelings, \"on such a subject i certainly\\nwill not.  you know very well that my opinion would have\\nno weight with you, unless it were on the side of your wishes.\"\\n\\n\"indeed you wrong me,\" replied lucy, with great\\nsolemnity; \"i know nobody of whose judgment i think\\nso highly as i do of yours; and i do really believe,\\nthat if you was to say to me, \\'i advise you by all means\\nto put an end to your engagement with edward ferrars,\\nit will be more for the happiness of both of you,\\'\\ni should resolve upon doing it immediately.\"\\n\\nelinor blushed for the insincerity of edward\\'s\\nfuture wife, and replied, \"this compliment would effectually\\nfrighten me from giving any opinion on the subject\\nhad i formed one.  it raises my influence much too high;\\nthe power of dividing two people so tenderly attached\\nis too much for an indifferent person.\"\\n\\n\"\\'tis because you are an indifferent person,\" said lucy,\\nwith some pique, and laying a particular stress on those words,\\n\"that your judgment might justly have such weight with me.\\nif you could be supposed to be biased in any respect\\nby your own feelings, your opinion would not be worth having.\"\\n\\nelinor thought it wisest to make no answer to this,\\nlest they might provoke each other to an unsuitable increase\\nof ease and unreserve; and was even partly determined\\nnever to mention the subject again.  another pause\\ntherefore of many minutes\\' duration, succeeded this speech,\\nand lucy was still the first to end it.\\n\\n\"shall you be in town this winter, miss dashwood?\"\\nsaid she with all her accustomary complacency.\\n\\n\"certainly not.\"\\n\\n\"i am sorry for that,\" returned the other,\\nwhile her eyes brightened at the information,\\n\"it would have gave me such pleasure to meet you there!\\nbut i dare say you will go for all that.  to be sure,\\nyour brother and sister will ask you to come to them.\"\\n\\n\"it will not be in my power to accept their invitation\\nif they do.\"\\n\\n\"how unlucky that is! i had quite depended upon\\nmeeting you there.  anne and me are to go the latter end\\nof january to some relations who have been wanting us to\\nvisit them these several years!  but i only go for the sake\\nof seeing edward.  he will be there in february, otherwise\\nlondon would have no charms for me; i have not spirits for it.\"\\n\\nelinor was soon called to the card-table by the\\nconclusion of the first rubber, and the confidential\\ndiscourse of the two ladies was therefore at an end,\\nto which both of them submitted without any reluctance,\\nfor nothing had been said on either side to make them\\ndislike each other less than they had done before;\\nand elinor sat down to the card table with the melancholy\\npersuasion that edward was not only without affection\\nfor the person who was to be his wife; but that he had\\nnot even the chance of being tolerably happy in marriage,\\nwhich sincere affection on her side would have given,\\nfor self-interest alone could induce a woman to keep a man\\nto an engagement, of which she seemed so thoroughly aware\\nthat he was weary.\\n\\nfrom this time the subject was never revived by elinor,\\nand when entered on by lucy, who seldom missed an opportunity\\nof introducing it, and was particularly careful to inform\\nher confidante, of her happiness whenever she received a letter\\nfrom edward, it was treated by the former with calmness\\nand caution, and dismissed as soon as civility would allow;\\nfor she felt such conversations to be an indulgence which\\nlucy did not deserve, and which were dangerous to herself.\\n\\nthe visit of the miss steeles at barton park was\\nlengthened far beyond what the first invitation implied.\\ntheir favour increased; they could not be spared;\\nsir john would not hear of their going; and in spite\\nof their numerous and long arranged engagements in exeter,\\nin spite of the absolute necessity of returning to fulfill\\nthem immediately, which was in full force at the end\\nof every week, they were prevailed on to stay nearly two\\nmonths at the park, and to assist in the due celebration\\nof that festival which requires a more than ordinary\\nshare of private balls and large dinners to proclaim\\nits importance.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 25\\n\\n\\nthough mrs. jennings was in the habit of spending a large\\nportion of the year at the houses of her children and friends,\\nshe was not without a settled habitation of her own.\\nsince the death of her husband, who had traded with success\\nin a less elegant part of the town, she had resided every\\nwinter in a house in one of the streets near portman square.\\ntowards this home, she began on the approach of january\\nto turn her thoughts, and thither she one day abruptly,\\nand very unexpectedly by them, asked the elder misses\\ndashwood to accompany her.  elinor, without observing\\nthe varying complexion of her sister, and the animated look\\nwhich spoke no indifference to the plan, immediately gave\\na grateful but absolute denial for both, in which she\\nbelieved herself to be speaking their united inclinations.\\nthe reason alleged was their determined resolution\\nof not leaving their mother at that time of the year.\\nmrs. jennings received the refusal with some surprise,\\nand repeated her invitation immediately.\\n\\n\"oh, lord! i am sure your mother can spare you\\nvery well, and i do beg you will favour me with\\nyour company, for i\\'ve quite set my heart upon it.\\ndon\\'t fancy that you will be any inconvenience to me,\\nfor i shan\\'t put myself at all out of my way for you.\\nit will only be sending betty by the coach, and i\\nhope i can afford that.  we three shall be able to go\\nvery well in my chaise; and when we are in town,\\nif you do not like to go wherever i do, well and good,\\nyou may always go with one of my daughters.  i am sure\\nyour mother will not object to it; for i have had such\\ngood luck in getting my own children off my hands that she\\nwill think me a very fit person to have the charge of you;\\nand if i don\\'t get one of you at least well married\\nbefore i have done with you, it shall not be my fault.\\ni shall speak a good word for you to all the young men,\\nyou may depend upon it.\"\\n\\n\"i have a notion,\" said sir john, \"that miss marianne\\nwould not object to such a scheme, if her elder sister\\nwould come into it.  it is very hard indeed that she\\nshould not have a little pleasure, because miss dashwood\\ndoes not wish it.  so i would advise you two, to set off\\nfor town, when you are tired of barton, without saying\\na word to miss dashwood about it.\"\\n\\n\"nay,\" cried mrs. jennings, \"i am sure i shall be\\nmonstrous glad of miss marianne\\'s company, whether miss\\ndashwood will go or not, only the more the merrier say i,\\nand i thought it would be more comfortable for them to\\nbe together; because, if they got tired of me, they might talk\\nto one another, and laugh at my old ways behind my back.\\nbut one or the other, if not both of them, i must have.\\nlord bless me! how do you think i can live poking by myself,\\ni who have been always used till this winter to have\\ncharlotte with me.  come, miss marianne, let us strike\\nhands upon the bargain, and if miss dashwood will change\\nher mind by and bye, why so much the better.\"\\n\\n\"i thank you, ma\\'am, sincerely thank you,\" said marianne,\\nwith warmth: \"your invitation has insured my gratitude for ever,\\nand it would give me such happiness, yes, almost the greatest\\nhappiness i am capable of, to be able to accept it.\\nbut my mother, my dearest, kindest mother,--i feel the\\njustice of what elinor has urged, and if she were to be\\nmade less happy, less comfortable by our absence--oh! no,\\nnothing should tempt me to leave her.  it should not,\\nmust not be a struggle.\"\\n\\nmrs. jennings repeated her assurance that mrs. dashwood\\ncould spare them perfectly well; and elinor, who now\\nunderstood her sister, and saw to what indifference to\\nalmost every thing else she was carried by her eagerness\\nto be with willoughby again, made no farther direct\\nopposition to the plan, and merely referred it to her\\nmother\\'s decision, from whom however she scarcely expected\\nto receive any support in her endeavour to prevent a visit,\\nwhich she could not approve of for marianne, and which\\non her own account she had particular reasons to avoid.\\nwhatever marianne was desirous of, her mother would be eager\\nto promote--she could not expect to influence the latter\\nto cautiousness of conduct in an affair respecting which she\\nhad never been able to inspire her with distrust; and she\\ndared not explain the motive of her own disinclination\\nfor going to london.  that marianne, fastidious as she was,\\nthoroughly acquainted with mrs. jennings\\' manners,\\nand invariably disgusted by them, should overlook every\\ninconvenience of that kind, should disregard whatever\\nmust be most wounding to her irritable feelings, in her\\npursuit of one object, was such a proof, so strong,\\nso full, of the importance of that object to her, as elinor,\\nin spite of all that had passed, was not prepared to witness.\\n\\non being informed of the invitation, mrs. dashwood,\\npersuaded that such an excursion would be productive\\nof much amusement to both her daughters, and perceiving\\nthrough all her affectionate attention to herself,\\nhow much the heart of marianne was in it, would not hear\\nof their declining the offer upon her account; insisted on\\ntheir both accepting it directly; and then began to foresee,\\nwith her usual cheerfulness, a variety of advantages that\\nwould accrue to them all, from this separation.\\n\\n\"i am delighted with the plan,\" she cried,\\n\"it is exactly what i could wish.  margaret and i shall\\nbe as much benefited by it as yourselves.  when you\\nand the middletons are gone, we shall go on so quietly\\nand happily together with our books and our music! you\\nwill find margaret so improved when you come back again!\\ni have a little plan of alteration for your bedrooms too,\\nwhich may now be performed without any inconvenience\\nto any one.  it is very right that you should go to town;\\ni would have every young woman of your condition in life\\nacquainted with the manners and amusements of london.\\nyou will be under the care of a motherly good sort\\nof woman, of whose kindness to you i can have no doubt.\\nand in all probability you will see your brother,\\nand whatever may be his faults, or the faults of his wife,\\nwhen i consider whose son he is, i cannot bear to have you so\\nwholly estranged from each other.\"\\n\\n\"though with your usual anxiety for our happiness,\"\\nsaid elinor, \"you have been obviating every impediment\\nto the present scheme which occurred to you, there is\\nstill one objection which, in my opinion, cannot be so\\neasily removed.\"\\n\\nmarianne\\'s countenance sunk.\\n\\n\"and what,\" said mrs. dashwood, \"is my dear prudent\\nelinor going to suggest?  what formidable obstacle is she\\nnow to bring forward?  do let me hear a word about the\\nexpense of it.\"\\n\\n\"my objection is this; though i think very well of\\nmrs. jennings\\'s heart, she is not a woman whose society\\ncan afford us pleasure, or whose protection will give\\nus consequence.\"\\n\\n\"that is very true,\" replied her mother, \"but of\\nher society, separately from that of other people,\\nyou will scarcely have any thing at all, and you will\\nalmost always appear in public with lady middleton.\"\\n\\n\"if elinor is frightened away by her dislike of\\nmrs. jennings,\" said marianne, \"at least it need not prevent\\nmy accepting her invitation.  i have no such scruples,\\nand i am sure i could put up with every unpleasantness\\nof that kind with very little effort.\"\\n\\nelinor could not help smiling at this display of\\nindifference towards the manners of a person, to whom she\\nhad often had difficulty in persuading marianne to behave\\nwith tolerable politeness; and resolved within herself,\\nthat if her sister persisted in going, she would\\ngo likewise, as she did not think it proper that marianne\\nshould be left to the sole guidance of her own judgment,\\nor that mrs. jennings should be abandoned to the mercy\\nof marianne for all the comfort of her domestic hours.\\nto this determination she was the more easily reconciled,\\nby recollecting that edward ferrars, by lucy\\'s account,\\nwas not to be in town before february; and that\\ntheir visit, without any unreasonable abridgement,\\nmight be previously finished.\\n\\n\"i will have you both go,\" said mrs. dashwood;\\n\"these objections are nonsensical.  you will have much\\npleasure in being in london, and especially in being together;\\nand if elinor would ever condescend to anticipate enjoyment,\\nshe would foresee it there from a variety of sources;\\nshe would, perhaps, expect some from improving her\\nacquaintance with her sister-in-law\\'s family.\"\\n\\nelinor had often wished for an opportunity of\\nattempting to weaken her mother\\'s dependence on the\\nattachment of edward and herself, that the shock might\\nbe less when the whole truth were revealed, and now\\non this attack, though almost hopeless of success,\\nshe forced herself to begin her design by saying,\\nas calmly as she could, \"i like edward ferrars very much,\\nand shall always be glad to see him; but as to the rest\\nof the family, it is a matter of perfect indifference\\nto me, whether i am ever known to them or not.\"\\n\\nmrs. dashwood smiled, and said nothing.\\nmarianne lifted up her eyes in astonishment, and elinor\\nconjectured that she might as well have held her tongue.\\n\\nafter very little farther discourse, it was finally\\nsettled that the invitation should be fully accepted.\\nmrs. jennings received the information with a great\\ndeal of joy, and many assurances of kindness and care;\\nnor was it a matter of pleasure merely to her.  sir john\\nwas delighted; for to a man, whose prevailing anxiety\\nwas the dread of being alone, the acquisition of two,\\nto the number of inhabitants in london, was something.\\neven lady middleton took the trouble of being delighted,\\nwhich was putting herself rather out of her way;\\nand as for the miss steeles, especially lucy, they had\\nnever been so happy in their lives as this intelligence\\nmade them.\\n\\nelinor submitted to the arrangement which counteracted\\nher wishes with less reluctance than she had expected\\nto feel.  with regard to herself, it was now a matter\\nof unconcern whether she went to town or not, and when\\nshe saw her mother so thoroughly pleased with the plan,\\nand her sister exhilarated by it in look, voice, and manner,\\nrestored to all her usual animation, and elevated to more\\nthan her usual gaiety, she could not be dissatisfied\\nwith the cause, and would hardly allow herself to distrust\\nthe consequence.\\n\\nmarianne\\'s joy was almost a degree beyond happiness,\\nso great was the perturbation of her spirits and her\\nimpatience to be gone.  her unwillingness to quit her\\nmother was her only restorative to calmness; and at the\\nmoment of parting her grief on that score was excessive.\\nher mother\\'s affliction was hardly less, and elinor\\nwas the only one of the three, who seemed to consider\\nthe separation as any thing short of eternal.\\n\\ntheir departure took place in the first week in january.\\nthe middletons were to follow in about a week.  the miss\\nsteeles kept their station at the park, and were to quit\\nit only with the rest of the family.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 26\\n\\n\\nelinor could not find herself in the carriage with mrs. jennings,\\nand beginning a journey to london under her protection,\\nand as her guest, without wondering at her own situation,\\nso short had their acquaintance with that lady been,\\nso wholly unsuited were they in age and disposition,\\nand so many had been her objections against such a measure\\nonly a few days before! but these objections had all,\\nwith that happy ardour of youth which marianne and her mother\\nequally shared, been overcome or overlooked; and elinor,\\nin spite of every occasional doubt of willoughby\\'s constancy,\\ncould not witness the rapture of delightful expectation\\nwhich filled the whole soul and beamed in the eyes\\nof marianne, without feeling how blank was her own prospect,\\nhow cheerless her own state of mind in the comparison,\\nand how gladly she would engage in the solicitude of\\nmarianne\\'s situation to have the same animating object\\nin view, the same possibility of hope.  a short, a very\\nshort time however must now decide what willoughby\\'s\\nintentions were; in all probability he was already in town.\\nmarianne\\'s eagerness to be gone declared her dependence\\non finding him there; and elinor was resolved not only upon\\ngaining every new light as to his character which her\\nown observation or the intelligence of others could give her,\\nbut likewise upon watching his behaviour to her sister\\nwith such zealous attention, as to ascertain what he was\\nand what he meant, before many meetings had taken place.\\nshould the result of her observations be unfavourable,\\nshe was determined at all events to open the eyes\\nof her sister; should it be otherwise, her exertions\\nwould be of a different nature--she must then learn\\nto avoid every selfish comparison, and banish every regret\\nwhich might lessen her satisfaction in the happiness of marianne.\\n\\nthey were three days on their journey, and marianne\\'s\\nbehaviour as they travelled was a happy specimen of what\\nfuture complaisance and companionableness to mrs. jennings\\nmight be expected to be.  she sat in silence almost all\\nthe way, wrapt in her own meditations, and scarcely ever\\nvoluntarily speaking, except when any object of picturesque\\nbeauty within their view drew from her an exclamation\\nof delight exclusively addressed to her sister.  to atone\\nfor this conduct therefore, elinor took immediate possession\\nof the post of civility which she had assigned herself,\\nbehaved with the greatest attention to mrs. jennings,\\ntalked with her, laughed with her, and listened to her\\nwhenever she could; and mrs. jennings on her side\\ntreated them both with all possible kindness, was solicitous\\non every occasion for their ease and enjoyment, and only\\ndisturbed that she could not make them choose their own\\ndinners at the inn, nor extort a confession of their\\npreferring salmon to cod, or boiled fowls to veal cutlets.\\nthey reached town by three o\\'clock the third day, glad to\\nbe released, after such a journey, from the confinement\\nof a carriage, and ready to enjoy all the luxury of a good fire.\\n\\nthe house was handsome, and handsomely fitted up,\\nand the young ladies were immediately put in possession\\nof a very comfortable apartment.  it had formerly\\nbeen charlotte\\'s, and over the mantelpiece still hung\\na landscape in coloured silks of her performance,\\nin proof of her having spent seven years at a great school\\nin town to some effect.\\n\\nas dinner was not to be ready in less than two\\nhours from their arrival, elinor determined to employ\\nthe interval in writing to her mother, and sat down for\\nthat purpose.  in a few moments marianne did the same.\\n\"i am writing home, marianne,\" said elinor; \"had not you\\nbetter defer your letter for a day or two?\"\\n\\n\"i am not going to write to my mother,\"\\nreplied marianne, hastily, and as if wishing to avoid\\nany farther inquiry.  elinor said no more; it immediately\\nstruck her that she must then be writing to willoughby;\\nand the conclusion which as instantly followed was,\\nthat, however mysteriously they might wish to conduct\\nthe affair, they must be engaged.  this conviction,\\nthough not entirely satisfactory, gave her pleasure,\\nand she continued her letter with greater alacrity.\\nmarianne\\'s was finished in a very few minutes;\\nin length it could be no more than a note; it was then\\nfolded up, sealed, and directed with eager rapidity.\\nelinor thought she could distinguish a large w in\\nthe direction; and no sooner was it complete than marianne,\\nringing the bell, requested the footman who answered it\\nto get that letter conveyed for her to the two-penny post.\\nthis decided the matter at once.\\n\\nher spirits still continued very high; but there\\nwas a flutter in them which prevented their giving much\\npleasure to her sister, and this agitation increased as\\nthe evening drew on.  she could scarcely eat any dinner,\\nand when they afterwards returned to the drawing room,\\nseemed anxiously listening to the sound of every carriage.\\n\\nit was a great satisfaction to elinor that mrs. jennings,\\nby being much engaged in her own room, could see little\\nof what was passing.  the tea things were brought in,\\nand already had marianne been disappointed more than once\\nby a rap at a neighbouring door, when a loud one was suddenly\\nheard which could not be mistaken for one at any other house,\\nelinor felt secure of its announcing willoughby\\'s approach,\\nand marianne, starting up, moved towards the door.\\nevery thing was silent; this could not be borne many seconds;\\nshe opened the door, advanced a few steps towards the stairs,\\nand after listening half a minute, returned into the room\\nin all the agitation which a conviction of having heard\\nhim would naturally produce; in the ecstasy of her\\nfeelings at that instant she could not help exclaiming,\\n\"oh, elinor, it is willoughby, indeed it is!\" and seemed\\nalmost ready to throw herself into his arms, when colonel\\nbrandon appeared.\\n\\nit was too great a shock to be borne with calmness,\\nand she immediately left the room.  elinor was disappointed too;\\nbut at the same time her regard for colonel brandon ensured\\nhis welcome with her; and she felt particularly hurt that\\na man so partial to her sister should perceive that she\\nexperienced nothing but grief and disappointment in seeing him.\\nshe instantly saw that it was not unnoticed by him,\\nthat he even observed marianne as she quitted the room,\\nwith such astonishment and concern, as hardly left him\\nthe recollection of what civility demanded towards herself.\\n\\n\"is your sister ill?\" said he.\\n\\nelinor answered in some distress that she was,\\nand then talked of head-aches, low spirits, and over fatigues;\\nand of every thing to which she could decently attribute\\nher sister\\'s behaviour.\\n\\nhe heard her with the most earnest attention,\\nbut seeming to recollect himself, said no more on the subject,\\nand began directly to speak of his pleasure at seeing them\\nin london, making the usual inquiries about their journey,\\nand the friends they had left behind.\\n\\nin this calm kind of way, with very little interest\\non either side, they continued to talk, both of them out\\nof spirits, and the thoughts of both engaged elsewhere.\\nelinor wished very much to ask whether willoughby were\\nthen in town, but she was afraid of giving him pain\\nby any enquiry after his rival; and at length, by way\\nof saying something, she asked if he had been in london\\never since she had seen him last.  \"yes,\" he replied,\\nwith some embarrassment, \"almost ever since; i have been\\nonce or twice at delaford for a few days, but it has never\\nbeen in my power to return to barton.\"\\n\\nthis, and the manner in which it was said,\\nimmediately brought back to her remembrance all the\\ncircumstances of his quitting that place, with the\\nuneasiness and suspicions they had caused to mrs. jennings,\\nand she was fearful that her question had implied\\nmuch more curiosity on the subject than she had ever felt.\\n\\nmrs. jennings soon came in.  \"oh! colonel,\" said she,\\nwith her usual noisy cheerfulness, \"i am monstrous glad\\nto see you--sorry i could not come before--beg your\\npardon, but i have been forced to look about me a little,\\nand settle my matters; for it is a long while since i\\nhave been at home, and you know one has always a world\\nof little odd things to do after one has been away for\\nany time; and then i have had cartwright to settle with--\\nlord, i have been as busy as a bee ever since dinner!\\nbut pray, colonel, how came you to conjure out that i should\\nbe in town today?\"\\n\\n\"i had the pleasure of hearing it at mr. palmer\\'s,\\nwhere i have been dining.\"\\n\\n\"oh, you did; well, and how do they all do at their\\nhouse?  how does charlotte do?  i warrant you she is a fine\\nsize by this time.\"\\n\\n\"mrs. palmer appeared quite well, and i am commissioned\\nto tell you, that you will certainly see her to-morrow.\"\\n\\n\"ay, to be sure, i thought as much.  well, colonel,\\ni have brought two young ladies with me, you see--that is,\\nyou see but one of them now, but there is another somewhere.\\nyour friend, miss marianne, too--which you will not be\\nsorry to hear.  i do not know what you and mr. willoughby\\nwill do between you about her.  ay, it is a fine thing\\nto be young and handsome.  well! i was young once, but i\\nnever was very handsome--worse luck for me.  however, i got\\na very good husband, and i don\\'t know what the greatest\\nbeauty can do more.  ah! poor man! he has been dead\\nthese eight years and better.  but colonel, where have\\nyou been to since we parted?  and how does your business\\ngo on?  come, come, let\\'s have no secrets among friends.\"\\n\\nhe replied with his accustomary mildness to all\\nher inquiries, but without satisfying her in any.\\nelinor now began to make the tea, and marianne was\\nobliged to appear again.\\n\\nafter her entrance, colonel brandon became\\nmore thoughtful and silent than he had been before,\\nand mrs. jennings could not prevail on him to stay long.\\nno other visitor appeared that evening, and the ladies\\nwere unanimous in agreeing to go early to bed.\\n\\nmarianne rose the next morning with recovered spirits\\nand happy looks.  the disappointment of the evening before\\nseemed forgotten in the expectation of what was to happen\\nthat day.  they had not long finished their breakfast before\\nmrs. palmer\\'s barouche stopped at the door, and in a few\\nminutes she came laughing into the room: so delighted\\nto see them all, that it was hard to say whether she\\nreceived most pleasure from meeting her mother or the miss\\ndashwoods again.  so surprised at their coming to town,\\nthough it was what she had rather expected all along;\\nso angry at their accepting her mother\\'s invitation\\nafter having declined her own, though at the same time\\nshe would never have forgiven them if they had not come!\\n\\n\"mr. palmer will be so happy to see you,\"\\nsaid she; \"what do you think he said when he heard\\nof your coming with mamma?  i forget what it was now,\\nbut it was something so droll!\"\\n\\nafter an hour or two spent in what her mother called\\ncomfortable chat, or in other words, in every variety of inquiry\\nconcerning all their acquaintance on mrs. jennings\\'s side,\\nand in laughter without cause on mrs. palmer\\'s, it was\\nproposed by the latter that they should all accompany\\nher to some shops where she had business that morning,\\nto which mrs. jennings and elinor readily consented,\\nas having likewise some purchases to make themselves;\\nand marianne, though declining it at first was induced\\nto go likewise.\\n\\nwherever they went, she was evidently always on\\nthe watch.  in bond street especially, where much of\\ntheir business lay, her eyes were in constant inquiry;\\nand in whatever shop the party were engaged, her mind was\\nequally abstracted from every thing actually before them,\\nfrom all that interested and occupied the others.\\nrestless and dissatisfied every where, her sister could\\nnever obtain her opinion of any article of purchase,\\nhowever it might equally concern them both: she received\\nno pleasure from anything; was only impatient to be at\\nhome again, and could with difficulty govern her vexation\\nat the tediousness of mrs. palmer, whose eye was caught\\nby every thing pretty, expensive, or new; who was wild\\nto buy all, could determine on none, and dawdled away her\\ntime in rapture and indecision.\\n\\nit was late in the morning before they returned home;\\nand no sooner had they entered the house than marianne flew\\neagerly up stairs, and when elinor followed, she found\\nher turning from the table with a sorrowful countenance,\\nwhich declared that no willoughby had been there.\\n\\n\"has no letter been left here for me since we went out?\"\\nsaid she to the footman who then entered with the parcels.\\nshe was answered in the negative.  \"are you quite sure\\nof it?\" she replied.  \"are you certain that no servant,\\nno porter has left any letter or note?\"\\n\\nthe man replied that none had.\\n\\n\"how very odd!\" said she, in a low and disappointed\\nvoice, as she turned away to the window.\\n\\n\"how odd, indeed!\" repeated elinor within herself,\\nregarding her sister with uneasiness.  \"if she had not\\nknown him to be in town she would not have written to him,\\nas she did; she would have written to combe magna;\\nand if he is in town, how odd that he should neither\\ncome nor write!  oh! my dear mother, you must be wrong\\nin permitting an engagement between a daughter so young,\\na man so little known, to be carried on in so doubtful,\\nso mysterious a manner!  i long to inquire; and how will my\\ninterference be borne.\"\\n\\nshe determined, after some consideration, that if\\nappearances continued many days longer as unpleasant as they\\nnow were, she would represent in the strongest manner\\nto her mother the necessity of some serious enquiry into the\\naffair.\\n\\nmrs. palmer and two elderly ladies of mrs. jennings\\'s\\nintimate acquaintance, whom she had met and invited\\nin the morning, dined with them.  the former left them\\nsoon after tea to fulfill her evening engagements;\\nand elinor was obliged to assist in making a whist table\\nfor the others.  marianne was of no use on these occasions,\\nas she would never learn the game; but though her time\\nwas therefore at her own disposal, the evening was by no\\nmeans more productive of pleasure to her than to elinor,\\nfor it was spent in all the anxiety of expectation and the\\npain of disappointment.  she sometimes endeavoured for a\\nfew minutes to read; but the book was soon thrown aside,\\nand she returned to the more interesting employment\\nof walking backwards and forwards across the room,\\npausing for a moment whenever she came to the window,\\nin hopes of distinguishing the long-expected rap.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 27\\n\\n\\n\"if this open weather holds much longer,\" said mrs. jennings,\\nwhen they met at breakfast the following morning,\\n\"sir john will not like leaving barton next week;\\n\\'tis a sad thing for sportsmen to lose a day\\'s pleasure.\\npoor souls!  i always pity them when they do; they seem\\nto take it so much to heart.\"\\n\\n\"that is true,\" cried marianne, in a cheerful voice,\\nand walking to the window as she spoke, to examine the day.\\n\"i had not thought of that.  this weather will keep many\\nsportsmen in the country.\"\\n\\nit was a lucky recollection, all her good spirits were\\nrestored by it.  \"it is charming weather for them indeed,\"\\nshe continued, as she sat down to the breakfast table\\nwith a happy countenance.  \"how much they must enjoy\\nit! but\" (with a little return of anxiety) \"it cannot\\nbe expected to last long.  at this time of the year,\\nand after such a series of rain, we shall certainly\\nhave very little more of it.  frosts will soon set in,\\nand in all probability with severity.  in another day\\nor two perhaps; this extreme mildness can hardly last\\nlonger--nay, perhaps it may freeze tonight!\"\\n\\n\"at any rate,\" said elinor, wishing to prevent\\nmrs. jennings from seeing her sister\\'s thoughts as clearly\\nas she did, \"i dare say we shall have sir john and lady\\nmiddleton in town by the end of next week.\"\\n\\n\"ay, my dear, i\\'ll warrant you we do.  mary always\\nhas her own way.\"\\n\\n\"and now,\" silently conjectured elinor, \"she will\\nwrite to combe by this day\\'s post.\"\\n\\nbut if she did, the letter was written and sent away\\nwith a privacy which eluded all her watchfulness to ascertain\\nthe fact.  whatever the truth of it might be, and far\\nas elinor was from feeling thorough contentment about it,\\nyet while she saw marianne in spirits, she could not be\\nvery uncomfortable herself.  and marianne was in spirits;\\nhappy in the mildness of the weather, and still happier\\nin her expectation of a frost.\\n\\nthe morning was chiefly spent in leaving cards at\\nthe houses of mrs. jennings\\'s acquaintance to inform\\nthem of her being in town; and marianne was all the time\\nbusy in observing the direction of the wind, watching the\\nvariations of the sky and imagining an alteration in the air.\\n\\n\"don\\'t you find it colder than it was in the morning,\\nelinor? there seems to me a very decided difference.\\ni can hardly keep my hands warm even in my muff.  it was\\nnot so yesterday, i think.  the clouds seem parting too,\\nthe sun will be out in a moment, and we shall have a\\nclear afternoon.\"\\n\\nelinor was alternately diverted and pained;\\nbut marianne persevered, and saw every night in the\\nbrightness of the fire, and every morning in the appearance\\nof the atmosphere, the certain symptoms of approaching frost.\\n\\nthe miss dashwoods had no greater reason to be\\ndissatisfied with mrs. jennings\\'s style of living, and set\\nof acquaintance, than with her behaviour to themselves,\\nwhich was invariably kind.  every thing in her household\\narrangements was conducted on the most liberal plan,\\nand excepting a few old city friends, whom, to lady\\nmiddleton\\'s regret, she had never dropped, she visited\\nno one to whom an introduction could at all discompose\\nthe feelings of her young companions.  pleased to find\\nherself more comfortably situated in that particular than\\nshe had expected, elinor was very willing to compound\\nfor the want of much real enjoyment from any of their\\nevening parties, which, whether at home or abroad,\\nformed only for cards, could have little to amuse her.\\n\\ncolonel brandon, who had a general invitation\\nto the house, was with them almost every day; he came\\nto look at marianne and talk to elinor, who often derived\\nmore satisfaction from conversing with him than from any\\nother daily occurrence, but who saw at the same time\\nwith much concern his continued regard for her sister.\\nshe feared it was a strengthening regard.  it grieved her\\nto see the earnestness with which he often watched marianne,\\nand his spirits were certainly worse than when at barton.\\n\\nabout a week after their arrival, it became\\ncertain that willoughby was also arrived.  his card\\nwas on the table when they came in from the morning\\'s drive.\\n\\n\"good god!\" cried marianne, \"he has been here while\\nwe were out.\"  elinor, rejoiced to be assured of his\\nbeing in london, now ventured to say, \"depend upon it,\\nhe will call again tomorrow.\"  but marianne seemed\\nhardly to hear her, and on mrs. jenning\\'s entrance,\\nescaped with the precious card.\\n\\nthis event, while it raised the spirits of elinor,\\nrestored to those of her sister all, and more than all,\\ntheir former agitation.  from this moment her mind was\\nnever quiet; the expectation of seeing him every hour\\nof the day, made her unfit for any thing.  she insisted\\non being left behind, the next morning, when the others\\nwent out.\\n\\nelinor\\'s thoughts were full of what might be passing\\nin berkeley street during their absence; but a moment\\'s\\nglance at her sister when they returned was enough to\\ninform her, that willoughby had paid no second visit there.\\na note was just then brought in, and laid on the table,\\n\\n\"for me!\" cried marianne, stepping hastily forward.\\n\\n\"no, ma\\'am, for my mistress.\"\\n\\nbut marianne, not convinced, took it instantly up.\\n\\n\"it is indeed for mrs. jennings; how provoking!\"\\n\\n\"you are expecting a letter, then?\" said elinor,\\nunable to be longer silent.\\n\\n\"yes, a little--not much.\"\\n\\nafter a short pause.  \"you have no confidence\\nin me, marianne.\"\\n\\n\"nay, elinor, this reproach from you--you who have\\nconfidence in no one!\"\\n\\n\"me!\" returned elinor in some confusion; \"indeed,\\nmarianne, i have nothing to tell.\"\\n\\n\"nor i,\" answered marianne with energy, \"our situations\\nthen are alike.  we have neither of us any thing to tell;\\nyou, because you do not communicate, and i, because\\ni conceal nothing.\"\\n\\nelinor, distressed by this charge of reserve in herself,\\nwhich she was not at liberty to do away, knew not how,\\nunder such circumstances, to press for greater openness\\nin marianne.\\n\\nmrs. jennings soon appeared, and the note being\\ngiven her, she read it aloud.  it was from lady middleton,\\nannouncing their arrival in conduit street the night before,\\nand requesting the company of her mother and cousins\\nthe following evening.  business on sir john\\'s part,\\nand a violent cold on her own, prevented their calling\\nin berkeley street.  the invitation was accepted;\\nbut when the hour of appointment drew near, necessary as\\nit was in common civility to mrs. jennings, that they\\nshould both attend her on such a visit, elinor had some\\ndifficulty in persuading her sister to go, for still\\nshe had seen nothing of willoughby; and therefore was\\nnot more indisposed for amusement abroad, than unwilling\\nto run the risk of his calling again in her absence.\\n\\nelinor found, when the evening was over,\\nthat disposition is not materially altered by a change\\nof abode, for although scarcely settled in town,\\nsir john had contrived to collect around him, nearly twenty\\nyoung people, and to amuse them with a ball.  this was\\nan affair, however, of which lady middleton did not approve.\\nin the country, an unpremeditated dance was very allowable;\\nbut in london, where the reputation of elegance was more\\nimportant and less easily attained, it was risking too much\\nfor the gratification of a few girls, to have it known that\\nlady middleton had given a small dance of eight or nine couple,\\nwith two violins, and a mere side-board collation.\\n\\nmr. and mrs. palmer were of the party; from the former,\\nwhom they had not seen before since their arrival in town,\\nas he was careful to avoid the appearance of any attention\\nto his mother-in-law, and therefore never came near her,\\nthey received no mark of recognition on their entrance.\\nhe looked at them slightly, without seeming to know\\nwho they were, and merely nodded to mrs. jennings from\\nthe other side of the room.  marianne gave one glance\\nround the apartment as she entered: it was enough--he\\nwas not there--and she sat down, equally ill-disposed\\nto receive or communicate pleasure.  after they had been\\nassembled about an hour, mr. palmer sauntered towards\\nthe miss dashwoods to express his surprise on seeing them\\nin town, though colonel brandon had been first informed\\nof their arrival at his house, and he had himself said\\nsomething very droll on hearing that they were to come.\\n\\n\"i thought you were both in devonshire,\" said he.\\n\\n\"did you?\" replied elinor.\\n\\n\"when do you go back again?\"\\n\\n\"i do not know.\" and thus ended their discourse.\\n\\nnever had marianne been so unwilling to dance\\nin her life, as she was that evening, and never so much\\nfatigued by the exercise.  she complained of it\\nas they returned to berkeley street.\\n\\n\"aye, aye,\" said mrs. jennings, \"we know the reason\\nof all that very well; if a certain person who shall\\nbe nameless, had been there, you would not have been a\\nbit tired: and to say the truth it was not very pretty\\nof him not to give you the meeting when he was invited.\"\\n\\n\"invited!\" cried marianne.\\n\\n\"so my daughter middleton told me, for it seems sir\\njohn met him somewhere in the street this morning.\"\\nmarianne said no more, but looked exceedingly hurt.\\nimpatient in this situation to be doing something\\nthat might lead to her sister\\'s relief, elinor resolved\\nto write the next morning to her mother, and hoped\\nby awakening her fears for the health of marianne,\\nto procure those inquiries which had been so long delayed;\\nand she was still more eagerly bent on this measure\\nby perceiving after breakfast on the morrow, that marianne\\nwas again writing to willoughby, for she could not suppose\\nit to be to any other person.\\n\\nabout the middle of the day, mrs. jennings went out by\\nherself on business, and elinor began her letter directly,\\nwhile marianne, too restless for employment, too anxious\\nfor conversation, walked from one window to the other,\\nor sat down by the fire in melancholy meditation.\\nelinor was very earnest in her application to her mother,\\nrelating all that had passed, her suspicions of\\nwilloughby\\'s inconstancy, urging her by every plea\\nof duty and affection to demand from marianne an account\\nof her real situation with respect to him.\\n\\nher letter was scarcely finished, when a rap\\nforetold a visitor, and colonel brandon was announced.\\nmarianne, who had seen him from the window, and who hated\\ncompany of any kind, left the room before he entered it.\\nhe looked more than usually grave, and though expressing\\nsatisfaction at finding miss dashwood alone, as if he\\nhad somewhat in particular to tell her, sat for some\\ntime without saying a word.  elinor, persuaded that he\\nhad some communication to make in which her sister\\nwas concerned, impatiently expected its opening.\\nit was not the first time of her feeling the same kind\\nof conviction; for, more than once before, beginning with\\nthe observation of \"your sister looks unwell to-day,\"\\nor \"your sister seems out of spirits,\" he had appeared\\non the point, either of disclosing, or of inquiring,\\nsomething particular about her.  after a pause of several\\nminutes, their silence was broken, by his asking her\\nin a voice of some agitation, when he was to congratulate\\nher on the acquisition of a brother?  elinor was not\\nprepared for such a question, and having no answer ready,\\nwas obliged to adopt the simple and common expedient,\\nof asking what he meant?  he tried to smile as he replied,\\n\"your sister\\'s engagement to mr. willoughby is very generally\\nknown.\"\\n\\n\"it cannot be generally known,\" returned elinor,\\n\"for her own family do not know it.\"\\n\\nhe looked surprised and said, \"i beg your pardon,\\ni am afraid my inquiry has been impertinent; but i had not\\nsupposed any secrecy intended, as they openly correspond,\\nand their marriage is universally talked of.\"\\n\\n\"how can that be? by whom can you have heard\\nit mentioned?\"\\n\\n\"by many--by some of whom you know nothing, by others\\nwith whom you are most intimate, mrs. jennings, mrs. palmer,\\nand the middletons.  but still i might not have believed it,\\nfor where the mind is perhaps rather unwilling to\\nbe convinced, it will always find something to support\\nits doubts, if i had not, when the servant let me in today,\\naccidentally seen a letter in his hand, directed to\\nmr. willoughby in your sister\\'s writing.  i came to inquire,\\nbut i was convinced before i could ask the question.\\nis every thing finally settled?  is it impossible to-?\\nbut i have no right, and i could have no chance of succeeding.\\nexcuse me, miss dashwood.  i believe i have been wrong\\nin saying so much, but i hardly know what to do, and on\\nyour prudence i have the strongest dependence.  tell me\\nthat it is all absolutely resolved on, that any attempt,\\nthat in short concealment, if concealment be possible,\\nis all that remains.\"\\n\\nthese words, which conveyed to elinor a direct avowal\\nof his love for her sister, affected her very much.\\nshe was not immediately able to say anything, and even\\nwhen her spirits were recovered, she debated for a short\\ntime, on the answer it would be most proper to give.\\nthe real state of things between willoughby and her sister\\nwas so little known to herself, that in endeavouring\\nto explain it, she might be as liable to say too much\\nas too little.  yet as she was convinced that marianne\\'s\\naffection for willoughby, could leave no hope of colonel\\nbrandon\\'s success, whatever the event of that affection\\nmight be, and at the same time wished to shield her conduct\\nfrom censure, she thought it most prudent and kind,\\nafter some consideration, to say more than she really knew\\nor believed.  she acknowledged, therefore, that though\\nshe had never been informed by themselves of the terms\\non which they stood with each other, of their mutual\\naffection she had no doubt, and of their correspondence\\nshe was not astonished to hear.\\n\\nhe listened to her with silent attention, and on\\nher ceasing to speak, rose directly from his seat,\\nand after saying in a voice of emotion, \"to your sister\\ni wish all imaginable happiness; to willoughby that he\\nmay endeavour to deserve her,\"--took leave, and went away.\\n\\nelinor derived no comfortable feelings from this\\nconversation, to lessen the uneasiness of her mind on\\nother points; she was left, on the contrary, with a\\nmelancholy impression of colonel brandon\\'s unhappiness,\\nand was prevented even from wishing it removed,\\nby her anxiety for the very event that must confirm it.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 28\\n\\n\\nnothing occurred during the next three or four days,\\nto make elinor regret what she had done, in applying\\nto her mother; for willoughby neither came nor wrote.\\nthey were engaged about the end of that time to attend\\nlady middleton to a party, from which mrs. jennings was\\nkept away by the indisposition of her youngest daughter;\\nand for this party, marianne, wholly dispirited,\\ncareless of her appearance, and seeming equally indifferent\\nwhether she went or staid, prepared, without one look\\nof hope or one expression of pleasure.  she sat by the\\ndrawing-room fire after tea, till the moment of lady\\nmiddleton\\'s arrival, without once stirring from her seat,\\nor altering her attitude, lost in her own thoughts,\\nand insensible of her sister\\'s presence; and when at\\nlast they were told that lady middleton waited for them\\nat the door, she started as if she had forgotten that\\nany one was expected.\\n\\nthey arrived in due time at the place of destination,\\nand as soon as the string of carriages before them\\nwould allow, alighted, ascended the stairs, heard their\\nnames announced from one landing-place to another in an\\naudible voice, and entered a room splendidly lit up,\\nquite full of company, and insufferably hot.  when they had\\npaid their tribute of politeness by curtsying to the lady\\nof the house, they were permitted to mingle in the crowd,\\nand take their share of the heat and inconvenience, to\\nwhich their arrival must necessarily add.  after some time\\nspent in saying little or doing less, lady middleton sat\\ndown to cassino, and as marianne was not in spirits for\\nmoving about, she and elinor luckily succeeding to chairs,\\nplaced themselves at no great distance from the table.\\n\\nthey had not remained in this manner long, before elinor\\nperceived willoughby, standing within a few yards\\nof them, in earnest conversation with a very fashionable\\nlooking young woman.  she soon caught his eye, and he\\nimmediately bowed, but without attempting to speak to her,\\nor to approach marianne, though he could not but see her;\\nand then continued his discourse with the same lady.\\nelinor turned involuntarily to marianne, to see whether\\nit could be unobserved by her.  at that moment she first\\nperceived him, and her whole countenance glowing with\\nsudden delight, she would have moved towards him instantly,\\nhad not her sister caught hold of her.\\n\\n\"good heavens!\" she exclaimed, \"he is there--he\\nis there--oh! why does he not look at me? why cannot\\ni speak to him?\"\\n\\n\"pray, pray be composed,\" cried elinor, \"and do\\nnot betray what you feel to every body present.\\nperhaps he has not observed you yet.\"\\n\\nthis however was more than she could believe herself;\\nand to be composed at such a moment was not only beyond\\nthe reach of marianne, it was beyond her wish.  she sat\\nin an agony of impatience which affected every feature.\\n\\nat last he turned round again, and regarded them both;\\nshe started up, and pronouncing his name in a tone\\nof affection, held out her hand to him.  he approached,\\nand addressing himself rather to elinor than marianne,\\nas if wishing to avoid her eye, and determined not to\\nobserve her attitude, inquired in a hurried manner after\\nmrs. dashwood, and asked how long they had been in town.\\nelinor was robbed of all presence of mind by such an address,\\nand was unable to say a word.  but the feelings of her sister\\nwere instantly expressed.  her face was crimsoned over,\\nand she exclaimed, in a voice of the greatest emotion,\\n\"good god! willoughby, what is the meaning of this?\\nhave you not received my letters?  will you not shake\\nhands with me?\"\\n\\nhe could not then avoid it, but her touch seemed\\npainful to him, and he held her hand only for a moment.\\nduring all this time he was evidently struggling for composure.\\nelinor watched his countenance and saw its expression\\nbecoming more tranquil.  after a moment\\'s pause, he spoke\\nwith calmness.\\n\\n\"i did myself the honour of calling in berkeley\\nstreet last tuesday, and very much regretted that i was\\nnot fortunate enough to find yourselves and mrs. jennings\\nat home.  my card was not lost, i hope.\"\\n\\n\"but have you not received my notes?\" cried marianne\\nin the wildest anxiety.  \"here is some mistake i am\\nsure--some dreadful mistake.  what can be the meaning\\nof it?  tell me, willoughby; for heaven\\'s sake tell me,\\nwhat is the matter?\"\\n\\nhe made no reply; his complexion changed and all his\\nembarrassment returned; but as if, on catching the eye\\nof the young lady with whom he had been previously talking,\\nhe felt the necessity of instant exertion, he recovered\\nhimself again, and after saying, \"yes, i had the pleasure\\nof receiving the information of your arrival in town,\\nwhich you were so good as to send me,\" turned hastily away\\nwith a slight bow and joined his friend.\\n\\nmarianne, now looking dreadfully white, and unable\\nto stand, sunk into her chair, and elinor, expecting every\\nmoment to see her faint, tried to screen her from the\\nobservation of others, while reviving her with lavender water.\\n\\n\"go to him, elinor,\" she cried, as soon as she\\ncould speak, \"and force him to come to me.  tell him\\ni must see him again--must speak to him instantly.--\\ni cannot rest--i shall not have a moment\\'s peace till this\\nis explained--some dreadful misapprehension or other.--\\noh go to him this moment.\"\\n\\n\"how can that be done? no, my dearest marianne,\\nyou must wait.  this is not the place for explanations.\\nwait only till tomorrow.\"\\n\\nwith difficulty however could she prevent her\\nfrom following him herself; and to persuade her to check\\nher agitation, to wait, at least, with the appearance\\nof composure, till she might speak to him with more privacy\\nand more effect, was impossible; for marianne continued\\nincessantly to give way in a low voice to the misery\\nof her feelings, by exclamations of wretchedness.\\nin a short time elinor saw willoughby quit the room by the\\ndoor towards the staircase, and telling marianne that he\\nwas gone, urged the impossibility of speaking to him again\\nthat evening, as a fresh argument for her to be calm.\\nshe instantly begged her sister would entreat lady\\nmiddleton to take them home, as she was too miserable\\nto stay a minute longer.\\n\\nlady middleton, though in the middle of a rubber,\\non being informed that marianne was unwell, was too\\npolite to object for a moment to her wish of going away,\\nand making over her cards to a friend, they departed\\nas soon the carriage could be found.  scarcely a word\\nwas spoken during their return to berkeley street.\\nmarianne was in a silent agony, too much oppressed even\\nfor tears; but as mrs. jennings was luckily not come home,\\nthey could go directly to their own room, where hartshorn\\nrestored her a little to herself.  she was soon undressed\\nand in bed, and as she seemed desirous of being alone,\\nher sister then left her, and while she waited the return\\nof mrs. jennings, had leisure enough for thinking over\\nthe past.\\n\\nthat some kind of engagement had subsisted\\nbetween willoughby and marianne she could not doubt,\\nand that willoughby was weary of it, seemed equally clear;\\nfor however marianne might still feed her own wishes,\\nshe could not attribute such behaviour to mistake\\nor misapprehension of any kind.  nothing but a thorough\\nchange of sentiment could account for it.  her indignation\\nwould have been still stronger than it was, had she\\nnot witnessed that embarrassment which seemed to speak\\na consciousness of his own misconduct, and prevented\\nher from believing him so unprincipled as to have been\\nsporting with the affections of her sister from the first,\\nwithout any design that would bear investigation.\\nabsence might have weakened his regard, and convenience\\nmight have determined him to overcome it, but that such\\na regard had formerly existed she could not bring herself\\nto doubt.\\n\\nas for marianne, on the pangs which so unhappy a meeting\\nmust already have given her, and on those still more\\nsevere which might await her in its probable consequence,\\nshe could not reflect without the deepest concern.\\nher own situation gained in the comparison; for while she\\ncould esteem edward as much as ever, however they might be\\ndivided in future, her mind might be always supported.\\nbut every circumstance that could embitter such an evil\\nseemed uniting to heighten the misery of marianne\\nin a final separation from willoughby--in an immediate\\nand irreconcilable rupture with him.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 29\\n\\n\\nbefore the house-maid had lit their fire the next day,\\nor the sun gained any power over a cold, gloomy morning\\nin january, marianne, only half dressed, was kneeling\\nagainst one of the window-seats for the sake of all\\nthe little light she could command from it, and writing\\nas fast as a continual flow of tears would permit her.\\nin this situation, elinor, roused from sleep by her agitation\\nand sobs, first perceived her; and after observing her\\nfor a few moments with silent anxiety, said, in a tone\\nof the most considerate gentleness,\\n\\n\"marianne, may i ask-?\"\\n\\n\"no, elinor,\" she replied, \"ask nothing; you will\\nsoon know all.\"\\n\\nthe sort of desperate calmness with which this was said,\\nlasted no longer than while she spoke, and was immediately\\nfollowed by a return of the same excessive affliction.\\nit was some minutes before she could go on with her letter,\\nand the frequent bursts of grief which still obliged her,\\nat intervals, to withhold her pen, were proofs enough of her\\nfeeling how more than probable it was that she was writing\\nfor the last time to willoughby.\\n\\nelinor paid her every quiet and unobtrusive attention\\nin her power; and she would have tried to sooth and\\ntranquilize her still more, had not marianne entreated her,\\nwith all the eagerness of the most nervous irritability,\\nnot to speak to her for the world.  in such circumstances,\\nit was better for both that they should not be long together;\\nand the restless state of marianne\\'s mind not only prevented\\nher from remaining in the room a moment after she was dressed,\\nbut requiring at once solitude and continual change of place,\\nmade her wander about the house till breakfast time, avoiding\\nthe sight of every body.\\n\\nat breakfast she neither ate, nor attempted to eat\\nany thing; and elinor\\'s attention was then all employed,\\nnot in urging her, not in pitying her, nor in appearing\\nto regard her, but in endeavouring to engage mrs. jenning\\'s\\nnotice entirely to herself.\\n\\nas this was a favourite meal with mrs. jennings,\\nit lasted a considerable time, and they were just setting\\nthemselves, after it, round the common working table, when a\\nletter was delivered to marianne, which she eagerly caught\\nfrom the servant, and, turning of a death-like paleness,\\ninstantly ran out of the room.  elinor, who saw as plainly\\nby this, as if she had seen the direction, that it must\\ncome from willoughby, felt immediately such a sickness\\nat heart as made her hardly able to hold up her head,\\nand sat in such a general tremour as made her fear it\\nimpossible to escape mrs. jenning\\'s notice.  that good lady,\\nhowever, saw only that marianne had received a letter\\nfrom willoughby, which appeared to her a very good joke,\\nand which she treated accordingly, by hoping, with a laugh,\\nthat she would find it to her liking.  of elinor\\'s distress,\\nshe was too busily employed in measuring lengths of worsted\\nfor her rug, to see any thing at all; and calmly continuing\\nher talk, as soon as marianne disappeared, she said,\\n\\n\"upon my word, i never saw a young woman so\\ndesperately in love in my life!  my girls were nothing\\nto her, and yet they used to be foolish enough; but as\\nfor miss marianne, she is quite an altered creature.\\ni hope, from the bottom of my heart, he won\\'t keep her\\nwaiting much longer, for it is quite grievous to see her\\nlook so ill and forlorn.  pray, when are they to be married?\"\\n\\nelinor, though never less disposed to speak than at\\nthat moment, obliged herself to answer such an attack\\nas this, and, therefore, trying to smile, replied, \"and have\\nyou really, ma\\'am, talked yourself into a persuasion\\nof my sister\\'s being engaged to mr. willoughby?  i thought\\nit had been only a joke, but so serious a question seems\\nto imply more; and i must beg, therefore, that you will not\\ndeceive yourself any longer.  i do assure you that nothing\\nwould surprise me more than to hear of their being going\\nto be married.\"\\n\\n\"for shame, for shame, miss dashwood! how can you\\ntalk so?  don\\'t we all know that it must be a match, that\\nthey were over head and ears in love with each other from\\nthe first moment they met?  did not i see them together\\nin devonshire every day, and all day long; and did not i\\nknow that your sister came to town with me on purpose\\nto buy wedding clothes?  come, come, this won\\'t do.\\nbecause you are so sly about it yourself, you think nobody\\nelse has any senses; but it is no such thing, i can tell you,\\nfor it has been known all over town this ever so long.\\ni tell every body of it and so does charlotte.\"\\n\\n\"indeed, ma\\'am,\" said elinor, very seriously,\\n\"you are mistaken.  indeed, you are doing a very unkind thing\\nin spreading the report, and you will find that you have\\nthough you will not believe me now.\"\\n\\nmrs. jennings laughed again, but elinor had not\\nspirits to say more, and eager at all events to know\\nwhat willoughby had written, hurried away to their room,\\nwhere, on opening the door, she saw marianne stretched on\\nthe bed, almost choked by grief, one letter in her hand,\\nand two or three others laying by her.  elinor drew near,\\nbut without saying a word; and seating herself on the bed,\\ntook her hand, kissed her affectionately several times,\\nand then gave way to a burst of tears, which at first\\nwas scarcely less violent than marianne\\'s. the latter,\\nthough unable to speak, seemed to feel all the tenderness\\nof this behaviour, and after some time thus spent in\\njoint affliction, she put all the letters into elinor\\'s hands;\\nand then covering her face with her handkerchief,\\nalmost screamed with agony.  elinor, who knew that such grief,\\nshocking as it was to witness it, must have its course,\\nwatched by her till this excess of suffering had somewhat\\nspent itself, and then turning eagerly to willoughby\\'s letter,\\nread as follows:\\n\\n                              \"bond street, january.\\n     \"my dear madam,\\n\\n     \"i have just had the honour of receiving your\\n     letter, for which i beg to return my sincere\\n     acknowledgments.  i am much concerned to find there\\n     was anything in my behaviour last night that did\\n     not meet your approbation; and though i am quite at\\n     a loss to discover in what point i could be so\\n     unfortunate as to offend you, i entreat your\\n     forgiveness of what i can assure you to have been\\n     perfectly unintentional.  i shall never reflect on\\n     my former acquaintance with your family in devonshire\\n     without the most grateful pleasure, and flatter\\n     myself it will not be broken by any mistake or\\n     misapprehension of my actions.  my esteem for your\\n     whole family is very sincere; but if i have been so\\n     unfortunate as to give rise to a belief of more than\\n     i felt, or meant to express, i shall reproach myself\\n     for not having been more guarded in my professions\\n     of that esteem.  that i should ever have meant more\\n     you will allow to be impossible, when you understand\\n     that my affections have been long engaged elsewhere,\\n     and it will not be many weeks, i believe, before\\n     this engagement is fulfilled.  it is with great\\n     regret that i obey your commands in returning the\\n     letters with which i have been honoured from you,\\n     and the lock of hair, which you so obligingly bestowed\\n     on me.\\n\\n     \"i am, dear madam,\\n               \"your most obedient\\n                    \"humble servant,\\n                                        \"john willoughby.\"\\n\\n\\nwith what indignation such a letter as this must\\nbe read by miss dashwood, may be imagined.  though aware,\\nbefore she began it, that it must bring a confession\\nof his inconstancy, and confirm their separation for ever,\\nshe was not aware that such language could be suffered\\nto announce it; nor could she have supposed willoughby\\ncapable of departing so far from the appearance of every\\nhonourable and delicate feeling--so far from the common\\ndecorum of a gentleman, as to send a letter so impudently\\ncruel: a letter which, instead of bringing with his desire\\nof a release any professions of regret, acknowledged no\\nbreach of faith, denied all peculiar affection whatever--\\na letter of which every line was an insult, and which\\nproclaimed its writer to be deep in hardened villainy.\\n\\nshe paused over it for some time with indignant\\nastonishment; then read it again and again; but every\\nperusal only served to increase her abhorrence of the man,\\nand so bitter were her feelings against him, that she\\ndared not trust herself to speak, lest she might wound\\nmarianne still deeper by treating their disengagement,\\nnot as a loss to her of any possible good but as an\\nescape from the worst and most irremediable of all\\nevils, a connection, for life, with an unprincipled man,\\nas a deliverance the most real, a blessing the most important.\\n\\nin her earnest meditations on the contents of the letter,\\non the depravity of that mind which could dictate it,\\nand probably, on the very different mind of a very different\\nperson, who had no other connection whatever with the affair\\nthan what her heart gave him with every thing that passed,\\nelinor forgot the immediate distress of her sister,\\nforgot that she had three letters on her lap yet unread,\\nand so entirely forgot how long she had been in the room,\\nthat when on hearing a carriage drive up to the door,\\nshe went to the window to see who could be coming so\\nunreasonably early, she was all astonishment to perceive\\nmrs. jennings\\'s chariot, which she knew had not been\\nordered till one.  determined not to quit marianne,\\nthough hopeless of contributing, at present, to her ease,\\nshe hurried away to excuse herself from attending\\nmrs. jennings, on account of her sister being indisposed.\\nmrs. jennings, with a thoroughly good-humoured concern\\nfor its cause, admitted the excuse most readily, and elinor,\\nafter seeing her safe off, returned to marianne, whom she\\nfound attempting to rise from the bed, and whom she reached\\njust in time to prevent her from falling on the floor,\\nfaint and giddy from a long want of proper rest and food;\\nfor it was many days since she had any appetite, and many\\nnights since she had really slept; and now, when her\\nmind was no longer supported by the fever of suspense,\\nthe consequence of all this was felt in an aching head,\\na weakened stomach, and a general nervous faintness.\\na glass of wine, which elinor procured for her directly,\\nmade her more comfortable, and she was at last able to express\\nsome sense of her kindness, by saying,\\n\\n\"poor elinor! how unhappy i make you!\"\\n\\n\"i only wish,\" replied her sister, \"there were\\nany thing i could do, which might be of comfort to you.\"\\n\\nthis, as every thing else would have been,\\nwas too much for marianne, who could only exclaim,\\nin the anguish of her heart, \"oh! elinor, i am miserable,\\nindeed,\" before her voice was entirely lost in sobs.\\n\\nelinor could no longer witness this torrent\\nof unresisted grief in silence.\\n\\n\"exert yourself, dear marianne,\" she cried,\\n\"if you would not kill yourself and all who love you.\\nthink of your mother; think of her misery while you suffer:\\nfor her sake you must exert yourself.\"\\n\\n\"i cannot, i cannot,\" cried marianne; \"leave me,\\nleave me, if i distress you; leave me, hate me, forget me!\\nbut do not torture me so.  oh! how easy for those,\\nwho have no sorrow of their own to talk of exertion!  happy,\\nhappy elinor, you cannot have an idea of what i suffer.\"\\n\\n\"do you call me happy, marianne?  ah! if you knew!--and\\ncan you believe me to be so, while i see you so wretched!\"\\n\\n\"forgive me, forgive me,\" throwing her arms round\\nher sister\\'s neck; \"i know you feel for me; i know what\\na heart you have; but yet you are--you must be happy;\\nedward loves you--what, oh what, can do away such happiness\\nas that?\"\\n\\n\"many, many circumstances,\" said elinor, solemnly.\\n\\n\"no, no, no,\" cried marianne wildly, \"he loves you,\\nand only you.  you can have no grief.\"\\n\\n\"i can have no pleasure while i see you in this state.\"\\n\\n\"and you will never see me otherwise.  mine is\\na misery which nothing can do away.\"\\n\\n\"you must not talk so, marianne.  have you no\\ncomforts? no friends?  is your loss such as leaves\\nno opening for consolation?  much as you suffer now,\\nthink of what you would have suffered if the discovery\\nof his character had been delayed to a later period--\\nif your engagement had been carried on for months and months,\\nas it might have been, before he chose to put an end to it.\\nevery additional day of unhappy confidence, on your side,\\nwould have made the blow more dreadful.\"\\n\\n\"engagement!\" cried marianne, \"there has been\\nno engagement.\"\\n\\n\"no engagement!\"\\n\\n\"no, he is not so unworthy as you believe him.\\nhe has broken no faith with me.\"\\n\\n\"but he told you that he loved you.\"\\n\\n\"yes--no--never absolutely.  it was every day implied,\\nbut never professedly declared.  sometimes i thought it\\nhad been--but it never was.\"\\n\\n\"yet you wrote to him?\"--\\n\\n\"yes--could that be wrong after all that had passed?--\\nbut i cannot talk.\"\\n\\nelinor said no more, and turning again to the three\\nletters which now raised a much stronger curiosity\\nthan before, directly ran over the contents of all.\\nthe first, which was what her sister had sent him\\non their arrival in town, was to this effect.\\n\\n                         berkeley street, january.\\n\\n     \"how surprised you will be, willoughby, on\\n     receiving this; and i think you will feel something\\n     more than surprise, when you know that

but i will not depend on it.  at any rate\\n     i shall expect you to-morrow. for the present, adieu.\\n\\n                                             \"m.d.\"\\n\\nher second note, which had been written on the morning\\nafter the dance at the middletons\\', was in these words:--\\n\\n     \"i cannot express my disappointment in having\\n     missed you the day before yesterday, nor my astonishment\\n     at not having received any answer to a note which\\n     i sent you above a week ago.  i have been expecting\\n     to hear from you, and still more to see you, every\\n     hour of the day.  pray call again as soon as possible,\\n     and explain the reason of my having expected this\\n     in vain.  you had better come earlier another time,\\n     because we are generally out by one.  we were last\\n     night at lady middleton\\'s, where there was a dance.\\n     i have been told that you were asked to be of the\\n     party.  but could it be so?  you must be very much\\n     altered indeed since we parted, if that could be\\n     the case, and you not there.  but i will not suppose\\n     this possible, and i hope very soon to receive your\\n     personal assurance of its being otherwise.\\n\\n                                            \"m.d.\"\\n\\nthe contents of her last note to him were these:--\\n\\n     \"what am i to imagine, willoughby, by your\\n     behaviour last night?  again i demand an explanation\\n     of it.  i was prepared to meet you with the pleasure\\n     which our separation naturally produced, with the\\n     familiarity which our intimacy at barton appeared\\n     to me to justify.  i was repulsed indeed! i have\\n     passed a wretched night in endeavouring to excuse\\n     a conduct which can scarcely be called less than\\n     insulting; but though i have not yet been able to\\n     form any reasonable apology for your behaviour,\\n     i am perfectly ready to hear your justification of\\n     it.  you have perhaps been misinformed, or purposely\\n     deceived, in something concerning me, which may have\\n     lowered me in your opinion.  tell me what it is,\\n     explain the grounds on which you acted, and i shall\\n     be satisfied, in being able to satisfy you.  it\\n     would grieve me indeed to be obliged to think ill\\n     of you; but if i am to do it, if i am to learn that\\n     you are not what we have hitherto believed you, that\\n     your regard for us all was insincere, that your\\n     behaviour to me was intended only to deceive, let\\n     it be told as soon as possible.  my feelings are at\\n     present in a state of dreadful indecision; i wish\\n     to acquit you, but certainty on either side will be\\n     ease to what i now suffer.  if your sentiments are\\n     no longer what they were, you will return my notes,\\n     and the lock of my hair which is in your possession.\\n\\n                                             \"m.d.\"\\n\\nthat such letters, so full of affection and confidence,\\ncould have been so answered, elinor, for willoughby\\'s sake,\\nwould have been unwilling to believe.  but her condemnation\\nof him did not blind her to the impropriety of their\\nhaving been written at all; and she was silently grieving\\nover the imprudence which had hazarded such unsolicited\\nproofs of tenderness, not warranted by anything preceding,\\nand most severely condemned by the event, when marianne,\\nperceiving that she had finished the letters, observed to\\nher that they contained nothing but what any one would\\nhave written in the same situation.\\n\\n\"i felt myself,\" she added, \"to be as solemnly\\nengaged to him, as if the strictest legal covenant\\nhad bound us to each other.\"\\n\\n\"i can believe it,\" said elinor; \"but unfortunately\\nhe did not feel the same.\"\\n\\n\"he did feel the same, elinor--for weeks and weeks he\\nfelt it.  i know he did.  whatever may have changed him now, (and\\nnothing but the blackest art employed against me can have done\\nit), i was once as dear to him as my own soul could wish.\\nthis lock of hair, which now he can so readily give up,\\nwas begged of me with the most earnest supplication.\\nhad you seen his look, his manner, had you heard his voice\\nat that moment!  have you forgot the last evening of our\\nbeing together at barton?  the morning that we parted\\ntoo!  when he told me that it might be many weeks before\\nwe met again--his distress--can i ever forget his distress?\"\\n\\nfor a moment or two she could say no more;\\nbut when this emotion had passed away, she added,\\nin a firmer tone,\\n\\n\"elinor, i have been cruelly used; but not by willoughby.\"\\n\\n\"dearest marianne, who but himself?  by whom can he\\nhave been instigated?\"\\n\\n\"by all the world, rather than by his own heart.\\ni could rather believe every creature of my acquaintance\\nleagued together to ruin me in his opinion, than believe\\nhis nature capable of such cruelty.  this woman of whom he\\nwrites--whoever she be--or any one, in short, but your own\\ndear self, mama, and edward, may have been so barbarous\\nto bely me.  beyond you three, is there a creature\\nin the world whom i would not rather suspect of evil\\nthan willoughby, whose heart i know so well?\"\\n\\nelinor would not contend, and only replied,\\n\"whoever may have been so detestably your enemy, let them\\nbe cheated of their malignant triumph, my dear sister,\\nby seeing how nobly the consciousness of your own\\ninnocence and good intentions supports your spirits.\\nit is a reasonable and laudable pride which resists\\nsuch malevolence.\"\\n\\n\"no, no,\" cried marianne, \"misery such as mine has\\nno pride.  i care not who knows that i am wretched.\\nthe triumph of seeing me so may be open to all the world.\\nelinor, elinor, they who suffer little may be proud and\\nindependent as they like--may resist insult, or return\\nmortification--but i cannot.  i must feel--i must be\\nwretched--and they are welcome to enjoy the consciousness\\nof it that can.\"\\n\\n\"but for my mother\\'s sake and mine--\"\\n\\n\"i would do more than for my own.  but to appear\\nhappy when i am so miserable--oh! who can require it?\"\\n\\nagain they were both silent.  elinor was employed\\nin walking thoughtfully from the fire to the window,\\nfrom the window to the fire, without knowing that she\\nreceived warmth from one, or discerning objects through\\nthe other; and marianne, seated at the foot of the bed,\\nwith her head leaning against one of its posts,\\nagain took up willoughby\\'s letter, and, after shuddering\\nover every sentence, exclaimed--\\n\\n\"it is too much! oh, willoughby, willoughby, could this\\nbe yours!  cruel, cruel--nothing can acquit you.  elinor,\\nnothing can.  whatever he might have heard against me--\\nought he not to have suspended his belief? ought he not to\\nhave told me of it, to have given me the power of clearing\\nmyself? \\'the lock of hair, (repeating it from the letter,)\\nwhich you so obligingly bestowed on me\\'--that is unpardonable.\\nwilloughby, where was your heart when you wrote those words?\\noh, barbarously insolent!--elinor, can he be justified?\"\\n\\n\"no, marianne, in no possible way.\"\\n\\n\"and yet this woman--who knows what her art may\\nhave been?--how long it may have been premeditated,\\nand how deeply contrived by her!--who is she?--who can\\nshe be?--whom did i ever hear him talk of as young and\\nattractive among his female acquaintance?--oh! no one,\\nno one--he talked to me only of myself.\"\\n\\nanother pause ensued; marianne was greatly agitated,\\nand it ended thus.\\n\\n\"elinor, i must go home.  i must go and comfort mama.\\ncan not we be gone to-morrow?\"\\n\\n\"to-morrow, marianne!\"\\n\\n\"yes, why should i stay here? i came only for\\nwilloughby\\'s sake--and now who cares for me? who regards me?\"\\n\\n\"it would be impossible to go to-morrow. we owe\\nmrs. jennings much more than civility; and civility of\\nthe commonest kind must prevent such a hasty removal as that.\"\\n\\n\"well then, another day or two, perhaps; but i cannot\\nstay here long, i cannot stay to endure the questions\\nand remarks of all these people.  the middletons and\\npalmers--how am i to bear their pity?  the pity of such\\na woman as lady middleton!  oh, what would he say to that!\"\\n\\nelinor advised her to lie down again, and for a\\nmoment she did so; but no attitude could give her ease;\\nand in restless pain of mind and body she moved from one\\nposture to another, till growing more and more hysterical,\\nher sister could with difficulty keep her on the bed at all,\\nand for some time was fearful of being constrained to call\\nfor assistance.  some lavender drops, however, which she\\nwas at length persuaded to take, were of use; and from\\nthat time till mrs. jennings returned, she continued\\non the bed quiet and motionless.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 30\\n\\n\\nmrs. jennings came immediately to their room on her return,\\nand without waiting to have her request of admittance answered,\\nopened the door and walked in with a look of real concern.\\n\\n\"how do you do my dear?\"--said she in a voice of great\\ncompassion to marianne, who turned away her face without\\nattempting to answer.\\n\\n\"how is she, miss dashwood?--poor thing! she looks very bad.--\\nno wonder.  ay, it is but too true.  he is to be married\\nvery soon--a good-for-nothing fellow!  i have no patience\\nwith him.  mrs. taylor told me of it half an hour ago,\\nand she was told it by a particular friend of miss\\ngrey herself, else i am sure i should not have believed it;\\nand i was almost ready to sink as it was.  well, said i,\\nall i can say is, that if this be true, he has used\\na young lady of my acquaintance abominably ill, and i\\nwish with all my soul his wife may plague his heart out.\\nand so i shall always say, my dear, you may depend on it.\\ni have no notion of men\\'s going on in this way; and if ever\\ni meet him again, i will give him such a dressing as he\\nhas not had this many a day.  but there is one comfort,\\nmy dear miss marianne; he is not the only young man\\nin the world worth having; and with your pretty face\\nyou will never want admirers.  well, poor thing!  i won\\'t\\ndisturb her any longer, for she had better have her cry\\nout at once and have done with.  the parrys and sandersons\\nluckily are coming tonight you know, and that will amuse her.\"\\n\\nshe then went away, walking on tiptoe out of the room,\\nas if she supposed her young friend\\'s affliction could\\nbe increased by noise.\\n\\nmarianne, to the surprise of her sister,\\ndetermined on dining with them.  elinor even advised\\nher against it.  but \"no, she would go down; she could\\nbear it very well, and the bustle about her would\\nbe less.\"  elinor, pleased to have her governed for a\\nmoment by such a motive, though believing it hardly\\npossible that she could sit out the dinner, said no more;\\nand adjusting her dress for her as well as she could,\\nwhile marianne still remained on the bed, was ready\\nto assist her into the dining room as soon as they were\\nsummoned to it.\\n\\nwhen there, though looking most wretchedly,\\nshe ate more and was calmer than her sister had expected.\\nhad she tried to speak, or had she been conscious of half\\nmrs. jennings\\'s well-meant but ill-judged attentions\\nto her, this calmness could not have been maintained;\\nbut not a syllable escaped her lips; and the abstraction\\nof her thoughts preserved her in ignorance of every thing\\nthat was passing before her.\\n\\nelinor, who did justice to mrs. jennings\\'s kindness,\\nthough its effusions were often distressing, and sometimes\\nalmost ridiculous, made her those acknowledgments,\\nand returned her those civilities, which her sister could\\nnot make or return for herself.  their good friend saw\\nthat marianne was unhappy, and felt that every thing\\nwas due to her which might make her at all less so.\\nshe treated her therefore, with all the indulgent fondness\\nof a parent towards a favourite child on the last day of\\nits holidays.  marianne was to have the best place by the fire,\\nwas to be tempted to eat by every delicacy in the house,\\nand to be amused by the relation of all the news of the day.\\nhad not elinor, in the sad countenance of her sister,\\nseen a check to all mirth, she could have been entertained\\nby mrs. jennings\\'s endeavours to cure a disappointment in love,\\nby a variety of sweetmeats and olives, and a good fire.\\nas soon, however, as the consciousness of all this was\\nforced by continual repetition on marianne, she could\\nstay no longer.  with a hasty exclamation of misery,\\nand a sign to her sister not to follow her, she directly got\\nup and hurried out of the room.\\n\\n\"poor soul!\" cried mrs. jennings, as soon as she was gone,\\n\"how it grieves me to see her!  and i declare if she is\\nnot gone away without finishing her wine!  and the dried\\ncherries too!  lord! nothing seems to do her any good.\\ni am sure if i knew of any thing she would like, i would\\nsend all over the town for it.  well, it is the oddest\\nthing to me, that a man should use such a pretty girl\\nso ill!  but when there is plenty of money on one side,\\nand next to none on the other, lord bless you! they care\\nno more about such things!--\"\\n\\n\"the lady then--miss grey i think you called her--\\nis very rich?\"\\n\\n\"fifty thousand pounds, my dear.  did you ever see\\nher? a smart, stylish girl they say, but not handsome.\\ni remember her aunt very well, biddy henshawe; she married\\na very wealthy man.  but the family are all rich together.\\nfifty thousand pounds! and by all accounts, it won\\'t come\\nbefore it\\'s wanted; for they say he is all to pieces.\\nno wonder! dashing about with his curricle and hunters!\\nwell, it don\\'t signify talking; but when a young man,\\nbe who he will, comes and makes love to a pretty girl,\\nand promises marriage, he has no business to fly off\\nfrom his word only because he grows poor, and a richer\\ngirl is ready to have him.  why don\\'t he, in such a case,\\nsell his horses, let his house, turn off his servants,\\nand make a thorough reform at once? i warrant you,\\nmiss marianne would have been ready to wait till matters\\ncame round.  but that won\\'t do now-a-days; nothing in the\\nway of pleasure can ever be given up by the young men of\\nthis age.\"\\n\\n\"do you know what kind of a girl miss grey is?\\nis she said to be amiable?\"\\n\\n\"i never heard any harm of her; indeed i hardly ever\\nheard her mentioned; except that mrs. taylor did say\\nthis morning, that one day miss walker hinted to her,\\nthat she believed mr. and mrs. ellison would not be sorry\\nto have miss grey married, for she and mrs. ellison could\\nnever agree.\"--\\n\\n\"and who are the ellisons?\"\\n\\n\"her guardians, my dear.  but now she is of age\\nand may choose for herself; and a pretty choice she has\\nmade!--what now,\" after pausing a moment--\"your poor sister\\nis gone to her own room, i suppose, to moan by herself.\\nis there nothing one can get to comfort her?  poor dear,\\nit seems quite cruel to let her be alone.  well, by-and-by we\\nshall have a few friends, and that will amuse her a little.\\nwhat shall we play at?  she hates whist i know; but is there\\nno round game she cares for?\"\\n\\n\"dear ma\\'am, this kindness is quite unnecessary.\\nmarianne, i dare say, will not leave her room again\\nthis evening.  i shall persuade her if i can to go\\nearly to bed, for i am sure she wants rest.\"\\n\\n\"aye, i believe that will be best for her.  let her name\\nher own supper, and go to bed.  lord! no wonder she has\\nbeen looking so bad and so cast down this last week or two,\\nfor this matter i suppose has been hanging over her head as\\nlong as that.  and so the letter that came today finished it!\\npoor soul!  i am sure if i had had a notion of it,\\ni would not have joked her about it for all my money.\\nbut then you know, how should i guess such a thing?  i made\\nsure of its being nothing but a common love letter, and\\nyou know young people like to be laughed at about them.  lord!\\nhow concerned sir john and my daughters will be when they\\nhear it!  if i had my senses about me i might have called\\nin conduit street in my way home, and told them of it.\\nbut i shall see them tomorrow.\"\\n\\n\"it would be unnecessary i am sure, for you to caution\\nmrs. palmer and sir john against ever naming mr. willoughby,\\nor making the slightest allusion to what has passed,\\nbefore my sister.  their own good-nature must point out\\nto them the real cruelty of appearing to know any thing\\nabout it when she is present; and the less that may ever\\nbe said to myself on the subject, the more my feelings\\nwill be spared, as you my dear madam will easily believe.\"\\n\\n\"oh! lord! yes, that i do indeed.  it must be terrible\\nfor you to hear it talked of; and as for your sister,\\ni am sure i would not mention a word about it to her\\nfor the world.  you saw i did not all dinner time.\\nno more would sir john, nor my daughters, for they are\\nall very thoughtful and considerate; especially if i\\ngive them a hint, as i certainly will.  for my part,\\ni think the less that is said about such things, the better,\\nthe sooner \\'tis blown over and forgot.  and what does\\ntalking ever do you know?\"\\n\\n\"in this affair it can only do harm; more so\\nperhaps than in many cases of a similar kind, for it\\nhas been attended by circumstances which, for the sake\\nof every one concerned in it, make it unfit to become\\nthe public conversation.  i must do this justice to\\nmr. willoughby--he has broken no positive engagement\\nwith my sister.\"\\n\\n\"law, my dear!  don\\'t pretend to defend him.\\nno positive engagement indeed! after taking her all\\nover allenham house, and fixing on the very rooms they\\nwere to live in hereafter!\"\\n\\nelinor, for her sister\\'s sake, could not press the\\nsubject farther, and she hoped it was not required of her\\nfor willoughby\\'s; since, though marianne might lose much,\\nhe could gain very little by the enforcement of the real truth.\\nafter a short silence on both sides, mrs. jennings,\\nwith all her natural hilarity, burst forth again.\\n\\n\"well, my dear, \\'tis a true saying about an ill-wind,\\nfor it will be all the better for colonel brandon.\\nhe will have her at last; aye, that he will.  mind me,\\nnow, if they an\\'t married by mid-summer.  lord! how he\\'ll\\nchuckle over this news!  i hope he will come tonight.\\nit will be all to one a better match for your sister.\\ntwo thousand a year without debt or drawback--except\\nthe little love-child, indeed; aye, i had forgot her;\\nbut she may be \\'prenticed out at a small cost, and then\\nwhat does it signify?  delaford is a nice place, i can\\ntell you; exactly what i call a nice old fashioned place,\\nfull of comforts and conveniences; quite shut in with great\\ngarden walls that are covered with the best fruit-trees\\nin the country; and such a mulberry tree in one corner!\\nlord! how charlotte and i did stuff the only time we\\nwere there!  then, there is a dove-cote, some delightful\\nstew-ponds, and a very pretty canal; and every thing,\\nin short, that one could wish for; and, moreover, it is\\nclose to the church, and only a quarter of a mile from\\nthe turnpike-road, so \\'tis never dull, for if you only\\ngo and sit up in an old yew arbour behind the house,\\nyou may see all the carriages that pass along.\\noh! \\'tis a nice place!  a butcher hard by in the village,\\nand the parsonage-house within a stone\\'s throw.\\nto my fancy, a thousand times prettier than barton park,\\nwhere they are forced to send three miles for their meat,\\nand have not a neighbour nearer than your mother.\\nwell, i shall spirit up the colonel as soon as i can.\\none shoulder of mutton, you know, drives another down.\\nif we can but put willoughby out of her head!\"\\n\\n\"ay, if we can do that, ma\\'am,\" said elinor,\\n\"we shall do very well with or without colonel brandon.\"\\nand then rising, she went away to join marianne,\\nwhom she found, as she expected, in her own room, leaning,\\nin silent misery, over the small remains of a fire,\\nwhich, till elinor\\'s entrance, had been her only light.\\n\\n\"you had better leave me,\" was all the notice\\nthat her sister received from her.\\n\\n\"i will leave you,\" said elinor, \"if you will go\\nto bed.\" but this, from the momentary perverseness\\nof impatient suffering, she at first refused to do.\\nher sister\\'s earnest, though gentle persuasion, however,\\nsoon softened her to compliance, and elinor saw her\\nlay her aching head on the pillow, and as she hoped,\\nin a way to get some quiet rest before she left her.\\n\\nin the drawing-room, whither she then repaired,\\nshe was soon joined by mrs. jennings, with a wine-glass,\\nfull of something, in her hand.\\n\\n\"my dear,\" said she, entering, \"i have just recollected\\nthat i have some of the finest old constantia wine in the\\nhouse that ever was tasted, so i have brought a glass of it\\nfor your sister.  my poor husband! how fond he was of it!\\nwhenever he had a touch of his old colicky gout, he said\\nit did him more good than any thing else in the world.\\ndo take it to your sister.\"\\n\\n\"dear ma\\'am,\" replied elinor, smiling at the difference\\nof the complaints for which it was recommended, \"how good\\nyou are!  but i have just left marianne in bed, and, i hope,\\nalmost asleep; and as i think nothing will be of so much\\nservice to her as rest, if you will give me leave,\\ni will drink the wine myself.\"\\n\\nmrs. jennings, though regretting that she had not been\\nfive minutes earlier, was satisfied with the compromise;\\nand elinor, as she swallowed the chief of it, reflected,\\nthat though its effects on a colicky gout were, at present,\\nof little importance to her, its healing powers,\\non a disappointed heart might be as reasonably tried\\non herself as on her sister.\\n\\ncolonel brandon came in while the party were at tea,\\nand by his manner of looking round the room for marianne,\\nelinor immediately fancied that he neither expected\\nnor wished to see her there, and, in short, that he\\nwas already aware of what occasioned her absence.\\nmrs. jennings was not struck by the same thought;\\nfor soon after his entrance, she walked across the room\\nto the tea-table where elinor presided, and whispered--\\n\"the colonel looks as grave as ever you see.  he knows\\nnothing of it; do tell him, my dear.\"\\n\\nhe shortly afterwards drew a chair close to her\\'s,\\nand, with a look which perfectly assured her of his\\ngood information, inquired after her sister.\\n\\n\"marianne is not well,\" said she.  \"she has been\\nindisposed all day, and we have persuaded her to go to bed.\"\\n\\n\"perhaps, then,\" he hesitatingly replied, \"what i\\nheard this morning may be--there may be more truth in it\\nthan i could believe possible at first.\"\\n\\n\"what did you hear?\"\\n\\n\"that a gentleman, whom i had reason to think--in short,\\nthat a man, whom i knew to be engaged--but how shall i\\ntell you?  if you know it already, as surely you must,\\ni may be spared.\"\\n\\n\"you mean,\" answered elinor, with forced calmness,\\n\"mr. willoughby\\'s marriage with miss grey.  yes, we do\\nknow it all.  this seems to have been a day of general\\nelucidation, for this very morning first unfolded it to us.\\nmr. willoughby is unfathomable!  where did you hear it?\"\\n\\n\"in a stationer\\'s shop in pall mall, where i\\nhad business.  two ladies were waiting for their carriage,\\nand one of them was giving the other an account of the\\nintended match, in a voice so little attempting concealment,\\nthat it was impossible for me not to hear all.  the name\\nof willoughby, john willoughby, frequently repeated,\\nfirst caught my attention; and what followed was a positive\\nassertion that every thing was now finally settled\\nrespecting his marriage with miss grey--it was no longer\\nto be a secret--it would take place even within a few weeks,\\nwith many particulars of preparations and other matters.\\none thing, especially, i remember, because it served\\nto identify the man still more:--as soon as the ceremony\\nwas over, they were to go to combe magna, his seat\\nin somersetshire.  my astonishment!--but it would be\\nimpossible to describe what i felt.  the communicative\\nlady i learnt, on inquiry, for i stayed in the shop\\ntill they were gone, was a mrs. ellison, and that, as i\\nhave been since informed, is the name of miss grey\\'s guardian.\"\\n\\n\"it is.  but have you likewise heard that miss grey\\nhas fifty thousand pounds?  in that, if in any thing,\\nwe may find an explanation.\"\\n\\n\"it may be so; but willoughby is capable--at least\\ni think\"--he stopped a moment; then added in a voice\\nwhich seemed to distrust itself, \"and your sister--\\nhow did she--\"\\n\\n\"her sufferings have been very severe.  i have\\nonly to hope that they may be proportionately short.\\nit has been, it is a most cruel affliction.  till yesterday,\\ni believe, she never doubted his regard; and even now,\\nperhaps--but i am almost convinced that he never was\\nreally attached to her.  he has been very deceitful! and,\\nin some points, there seems a hardness of heart about him.\"\\n\\n\"ah!\" said colonel brandon, \"there is, indeed!  but\\nyour sister does not--i think you said so--she does\\nnot consider quite as you do?\"\\n\\n\"you know her disposition, and may believe how eagerly\\nshe would still justify him if she could.\"\\n\\nhe made no answer; and soon afterwards, by the removal\\nof the tea-things, and the arrangement of the card parties,\\nthe subject was necessarily dropped.  mrs. jennings, who had\\nwatched them with pleasure while they were talking, and who\\nexpected to see the effect of miss dashwood\\'s communication,\\nin such an instantaneous gaiety on colonel brandon\\'s side,\\nas might have become a man in the bloom of youth, of hope\\nand happiness, saw him, with amazement, remain the whole\\nevening more serious and thoughtful than usual.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 31\\n\\n\\nfrom a night of more sleep than she had expected,\\nmarianne awoke the next morning to the same consciousness\\nof misery in which she had closed her eyes.\\n\\nelinor encouraged her as much as possible to talk\\nof what she felt; and before breakfast was ready, they had\\ngone through the subject again and again; and with the same\\nsteady conviction and affectionate counsel on elinor\\'s side,\\nthe same impetuous feelings and varying opinions on\\nmarianne\\'s, as before.  sometimes she could believe\\nwilloughby to be as unfortunate and as innocent as herself,\\nand at others, lost every consolation in the impossibility\\nof acquitting him.  at one moment she was absolutely\\nindifferent to the observation of all the world, at another\\nshe would seclude herself from it for ever, and at a third\\ncould resist it with energy.  in one thing, however,\\nshe was uniform, when it came to the point, in avoiding,\\nwhere it was possible, the presence of mrs. jennings,\\nand in a determined silence when obliged to endure it.\\nher heart was hardened against the belief of mrs. jennings\\'s\\nentering into her sorrows with any compassion.\\n\\n\"no, no, no, it cannot be,\" she cried;\\n\"she cannot feel.  her kindness is not sympathy;\\nher good-nature is not tenderness.  all that she wants\\nis gossip, and she only likes me now because i supply it.\"\\n\\nelinor had not needed this to be assured of the injustice\\nto which her sister was often led in her opinion of others,\\nby the irritable refinement of her own mind, and the too\\ngreat importance placed by her on the delicacies of a\\nstrong sensibility, and the graces of a polished manner.\\nlike half the rest of the world, if more than half there\\nbe that are clever and good, marianne, with excellent\\nabilities and an excellent disposition, was neither\\nreasonable nor candid.  she expected from other people\\nthe same opinions and feelings as her own, and she judged\\nof their motives by the immediate effect of their actions\\non herself.  thus a circumstance occurred, while the\\nsisters were together in their own room after breakfast,\\nwhich sunk the heart of mrs. jennings still lower\\nin her estimation; because, through her own weakness,\\nit chanced to prove a source of fresh pain to herself,\\nthough mrs. jennings was governed in it by an impulse\\nof the utmost goodwill.\\n\\nwith a letter in her outstretched hand, and countenance\\ngaily smiling, from the persuasion of bringing comfort,\\nshe entered their room, saying,\\n\\n\"now, my dear, i bring you something that i am sure\\nwill do you good.\"\\n\\nmarianne heard enough.  in one moment her imagination\\nplaced before her a letter from willoughby, full of tenderness\\nand contrition, explanatory of all that had passed, satisfactory,\\nconvincing; and instantly followed by willoughby himself,\\nrushing eagerly into the room to inforce, at her feet,\\nby the eloquence of his eyes, the assurances of his letter.\\nthe work of one moment was destroyed by the next.\\nthe hand writing of her mother, never till then unwelcome,\\nwas before her; and, in the acuteness of the disappointment\\nwhich followed such an ecstasy of more than hope,\\nshe felt as if, till that instant, she had never suffered.\\n\\nthe cruelty of mrs. jennings no language, within\\nher reach in her moments of happiest eloquence,\\ncould have expressed; and now she could reproach her\\nonly by the tears which streamed from her eyes with\\npassionate violence--a reproach, however, so entirely\\nlost on its object, that after many expressions of pity,\\nshe withdrew, still referring her to the letter of comfort.\\nbut the letter, when she was calm enough to read it,\\nbrought little comfort.  willoughby filled every page.\\nher mother, still confident of their engagement, and relying\\nas warmly as ever on his constancy, had only been roused\\nby elinor\\'s application, to intreat from marianne greater\\nopenness towards them both; and this, with such tenderness\\ntowards her, such affection for willoughby, and such\\na conviction of their future happiness in each other,\\nthat she wept with agony through the whole of it.\\n\\nall her impatience to be at home again now returned;\\nher mother was dearer to her than ever; dearer through\\nthe very excess of her mistaken confidence in willoughby,\\nand she was wildly urgent to be gone.  elinor, unable herself\\nto determine whether it were better for marianne to be\\nin london or at barton, offered no counsel of her own\\nexcept of patience till their mother\\'s wishes could be known;\\nand at length she obtained her sister\\'s consent to wait\\nfor that knowledge.\\n\\nmrs. jennings left them earlier than usual; for she\\ncould not be easy till the middletons and palmers were able\\nto grieve as much as herself; and positively refusing\\nelinor\\'s offered attendance, went out alone for the rest\\nof the morning.  elinor, with a very heavy heart, aware of\\nthe pain she was going to communicate, and perceiving,\\nby marianne\\'s letter, how ill she had succeeded in laying\\nany foundation for it, then sat down to write her mother\\nan account of what had passed, and entreat her directions\\nfor the future; while marianne, who came into the drawing-room\\non mrs. jennings\\'s going away, remained fixed at the table\\nwhere elinor wrote, watching the advancement of her pen,\\ngrieving over her for the hardship of such a task,\\nand grieving still more fondly over its effect on her mother.\\n\\nin this manner they had continued about a quarter\\nof an hour, when marianne, whose nerves could not then\\nbear any sudden noise, was startled by a rap at the door.\\n\\n\"who can this be?\" cried elinor.  \"so early too! i\\nthought we had been safe.\"\\n\\nmarianne moved to the window--\\n\\n\"it is colonel brandon!\" said she, with vexation.\\n\"we are never safe from him.\"\\n\\n\"he will not come in, as mrs. jennings is from home.\"\\n\\n\"i will not trust to that,\" retreating to her own room.\\n\"a man who has nothing to do with his own time has no\\nconscience in his intrusion on that of others.\"\\n\\nthe event proved her conjecture right, though it\\nwas founded on injustice and error; for colonel brandon\\ndid come in; and elinor, who was convinced that\\nsolicitude for marianne brought him thither, and who saw\\nthat solicitude in his disturbed and melancholy look,\\nand in his anxious though brief inquiry after her,\\ncould not forgive her sister for esteeming him so lightly.\\n\\n\"i met mrs. jennings in bond street,\" said he,\\nafter the first salutation, \"and she encouraged me\\nto come on; and i was the more easily encouraged,\\nbecause i thought it probable that i might find you alone,\\nwhich i was very desirous of doing.  my object--my\\nwish--my sole wish in desiring it--i hope, i believe\\nit is--is to be a means of giving comfort;--no, i must\\nnot say comfort--not present comfort--but conviction,\\nlasting conviction to your sister\\'s mind.  my regard for her,\\nfor yourself, for your mother--will you allow me to prove it,\\nby relating some circumstances which nothing but a very\\nsincere regard--nothing but an earnest desire of being\\nuseful--i think i am justified--though where so many hours\\nhave been spent in convincing myself that i am right,\\nis there not some reason to fear i may be wrong?\"\\nhe stopped.\\n\\n\"i understand you,\" said elinor.  \"you have something\\nto tell me of mr. willoughby, that will open his character\\nfarther.  your telling it will be the greatest act of friendship\\nthat can be shewn marianne.  my gratitude will be insured\\nimmediately by any information tending to that end, and hers\\nmust be gained by it in time.  pray, pray let me hear it.\"\\n\\n\"you shall; and, to be brief, when i quitted barton\\nlast october,--but this will give you no idea--i must go\\nfarther back.  you will find me a very awkward narrator,\\nmiss dashwood; i hardly know where to begin.  a short\\naccount of myself, i believe, will be necessary, and it\\nshall be a short one.  on such a subject,\" sighing heavily,\\n\"can i have little temptation to be diffuse.\"\\n\\nhe stopt a moment for recollection, and then,\\nwith another sigh, went on.\\n\\n\"you have probably entirely forgotten a conversation--\\n(it is not to be supposed that it could make any impression\\non you)--a conversation between us one evening at barton\\npark--it was the evening of a dance--in which i alluded\\nto a lady i had once known, as resembling, in some measure,\\nyour sister marianne.\"\\n\\n\"indeed,\" answered elinor, \"i have not forgotten it.\"\\nhe looked pleased by this remembrance, and added,\\n\\n\"if i am not deceived by the uncertainty, the partiality\\nof tender recollection, there is a very strong resemblance\\nbetween them, as well in mind as person.  the same warmth\\nof heart, the same eagerness of fancy and spirits.\\nthis lady was one of my nearest relations, an orphan from\\nher infancy, and under the guardianship of my father.\\nour ages were nearly the same, and from our earliest years\\nwe were playfellows and friends.  i cannot remember the\\ntime when i did not love eliza; and my affection for her,\\nas we grew up, was such, as perhaps, judging from my\\npresent forlorn and cheerless gravity, you might think me\\nincapable of having ever felt.  her\\'s, for me, was, i believe,\\nfervent as the attachment of your sister to mr. willoughby\\nand it was, though from a different cause, no less unfortunate.\\nat seventeen she was lost to me for ever.  she was\\nmarried--married against her inclination to my brother.\\nher fortune was large, and our family estate much encumbered.\\nand this, i fear, is all that can be said for the\\nconduct of one, who was at once her uncle and guardian.\\nmy brother did not deserve her; he did not even love her.\\ni had hoped that her regard for me would support her\\nunder any difficulty, and for some time it did; but at\\nlast the misery of her situation, for she experienced\\ngreat unkindness, overcame all her resolution, and though\\nshe had promised me that nothing--but how blindly i\\nrelate!  i have never told you how this was brought on.\\nwe were within a few hours of eloping together for scotland.\\nthe treachery, or the folly, of my cousin\\'s maid betrayed us.\\ni was banished to the house of a relation far distant,\\nand she was allowed no liberty, no society, no amusement,\\ntill my father\\'s point was gained.  i had depended on her\\nfortitude too far, and the blow was a severe one--\\nbut had her marriage been happy, so young as i then was,\\na few months must have reconciled me to it, or at least\\ni should not have now to lament it.  this however\\nwas not the case.  my brother had no regard for her;\\nhis pleasures were not what they ought to have been,\\nand from the first he treated her unkindly.  the consequence\\nof this, upon a mind so young, so lively, so inexperienced\\nas mrs. brandon\\'s, was but too natural.  she resigned\\nherself at first to all the misery of her situation;\\nand happy had it been if she had not lived to overcome those\\nregrets which the remembrance of me occasioned.  but can we\\nwonder that, with such a husband to provoke inconstancy,\\nand without a friend to advise or restrain her (for\\nmy father lived only a few months after their marriage,\\nand i was with my regiment in the east indies) she\\nshould fall?  had i remained in england, perhaps--but i\\nmeant to promote the happiness of both by removing\\nfrom her for years, and for that purpose had procured\\nmy exchange.  the shock which her marriage had given me,\"\\nhe continued, in a voice of great agitation, \"was of\\ntrifling weight--was nothing to what i felt when i heard,\\nabout two years afterwards, of her divorce.  it was\\nthat which threw this gloom,--even now the recollection\\nof what i suffered--\"\\n\\nhe could say no more, and rising hastily walked for a few\\nminutes about the room.  elinor, affected by his relation,\\nand still more by his distress, could not speak.  he saw\\nher concern, and coming to her, took her hand, pressed it,\\nand kissed it with grateful respect.  a few minutes more\\nof silent exertion enabled him to proceed with composure.\\n\\n\"it was nearly three years after this unhappy\\nperiod before i returned to england.  my first care,\\nwhen i did arrive, was of course to seek for her;\\nbut the search was as fruitless as it was melancholy.\\ni could not trace her beyond her first seducer, and there\\nwas every reason to fear that she had removed from him\\nonly to sink deeper in a life of sin.  her legal allowance\\nwas not adequate to her fortune, nor sufficient for her\\ncomfortable maintenance, and i learnt from my brother that\\nthe power of receiving it had been made over some months\\nbefore to another person.  he imagined, and calmly could he\\nimagine it, that her extravagance, and consequent distress,\\nhad obliged her to dispose of it for some immediate relief.\\nat last, however, and after i had been six months in england,\\ni did find her.  regard for a former servant of my own,\\nwho had since fallen into misfortune, carried me to visit\\nhim in a spunging-house, where he was confined for debt;\\nand there, the same house, under a similar confinement,\\nwas my unfortunate sister.  so altered--so faded--worn\\ndown by acute suffering of every kind! hardly could i\\nbelieve the melancholy and sickly figure before me,\\nto be the remains of the lovely, blooming, healthful girl,\\non whom i had once doted.  what i endured in so beholding\\nher--but i have no right to wound your feelings by attempting\\nto describe it--i have pained you too much already.\\nthat she was, to all appearance, in the last stage\\nof a consumption, was--yes, in such a situation it was\\nmy greatest comfort.  life could do nothing for her,\\nbeyond giving time for a better preparation for death;\\nand that was given.  i saw her placed in comfortable lodgings,\\nand under proper attendants; i visited her every day\\nduring the rest of her short life: i was with her in her\\nlast moments.\"\\n\\nagain he stopped to recover himself; and elinor\\nspoke her feelings in an exclamation of tender concern,\\nat the fate of his unfortunate friend.\\n\\n\"your sister, i hope, cannot be offended,\" said he,\\n\"by the resemblance i have fancied between her and my\\npoor disgraced relation.  their fates, their fortunes,\\ncannot be the same; and had the natural sweet\\ndisposition of the one been guarded by a firmer mind,\\nor a happier marriage, she might have been all that you\\nwill live to see the other be.  but to what does all this\\nlead?  i seem to have been distressing you for nothing.\\nah! miss dashwood--a subject such as this--untouched\\nfor fourteen years--it is dangerous to handle it at all!\\ni will be more collected--more concise.  she left to my care\\nher only child, a little girl, the offspring of her first\\nguilty connection, who was then about three years old.\\nshe loved the child, and had always kept it with her.\\nit was a valued, a precious trust to me; and gladly\\nwould i have discharged it in the strictest sense,\\nby watching over her education myself, had the nature\\nof our situations allowed it; but i had no family, no home;\\nand my little eliza was therefore placed at school.\\ni saw her there whenever i could, and after the death of my\\nbrother, (which happened about five years ago, and which\\nleft to me the possession of the family property,) she\\nvisited me at delaford.  i called her a distant relation;\\nbut i am well aware that i have in general been suspected\\nof a much nearer connection with her.  it is now three\\nyears ago (she had just reached her fourteenth year,)\\nthat i removed her from school, to place her under the care\\nof a very respectable woman, residing in dorsetshire,\\nwho had the charge of four or five other girls of about\\nthe same time of life; and for two years i had every reason\\nto be pleased with her situation.  but last february,\\nalmost a twelvemonth back, she suddenly disappeared.\\ni had allowed her, (imprudently, as it has since turned\\nout,) at her earnest desire, to go to bath with one of\\nher young friends, who was attending her father there\\nfor his health.  i knew him to be a very good sort of man,\\nand i thought well of his daughter--better than she deserved,\\nfor, with a most obstinate and ill-judged secrecy,\\nshe would tell nothing, would give no clue, though she\\ncertainly knew all.  he, her father, a well-meaning,\\nbut not a quick-sighted man, could really, i believe,\\ngive no information; for he had been generally confined\\nto the house, while the girls were ranging over the town\\nand making what acquaintance they chose; and he tried\\nto convince me, as thoroughly as he was convinced himself,\\nof his daughter\\'s being entirely unconcerned in the business.\\nin short, i could learn nothing but that she was gone;\\nall the rest, for eight long months, was left to conjecture.\\nwhat i thought, what i feared, may be imagined; and what i\\nsuffered too.\"\\n\\n\"good heavens!\" cried elinor, \"could it be--could\\nwilloughby!\"--\\n\\n\"the first news that reached me of her,\" he continued,\\n\"came in a letter from herself, last october.\\nit was forwarded to me from delaford, and i received it\\non the very morning of our intended party to whitwell;\\nand this was the reason of my leaving barton so suddenly,\\nwhich i am sure must at the time have appeared strange\\nto every body, and which i believe gave offence to some.\\nlittle did mr. willoughby imagine, i suppose, when his\\nlooks censured me for incivility in breaking up the party,\\nthat i was called away to the relief of one whom he\\nhad made poor and miserable; but had he known it,\\nwhat would it have availed?  would he have been less\\ngay or less happy in the smiles of your sister?  no,\\nhe had already done that, which no man who can feel\\nfor another would do.  he had left the girl whose\\nyouth and innocence he had seduced, in a situation of\\nthe utmost distress, with no creditable home, no help,\\nno friends, ignorant of his address!  he had left her,\\npromising to return; he neither returned, nor wrote,\\nnor relieved her.\"\\n\\n\"this is beyond every thing!\" exclaimed elinor.\\n\\n\"his character is now before you; expensive, dissipated,\\nand worse than both.  knowing all this, as i have now\\nknown it many weeks, guess what i must have felt on seeing\\nyour sister as fond of him as ever, and on being assured\\nthat she was to marry him: guess what i must have felt\\nfor all your sakes.  when i came to you last week and\\nfound you alone, i came determined to know the truth;\\nthough irresolute what to do when it was known.\\nmy behaviour must have seemed strange to you then;\\nbut now you will comprehend it.  to suffer you all to be\\nso deceived; to see your sister--but what could i do?\\ni had no hope of interfering with success; and sometimes\\ni thought your sister\\'s influence might yet reclaim him.\\nbut now, after such dishonorable usage, who can tell what\\nwere his designs on her.  whatever they may have been,\\nhowever, she may now, and hereafter doubtless will\\nturn with gratitude towards her own condition, when she\\ncompares it with that of my poor eliza, when she considers\\nthe wretched and hopeless situation of this poor girl,\\nand pictures her to herself, with an affection for him so strong,\\nstill as strong as her own, and with a mind tormented\\nby self-reproach, which must attend her through life.\\nsurely this comparison must have its use with her.\\nshe will feel her own sufferings to be nothing.  they\\nproceed from no misconduct, and can bring no disgrace.\\non the contrary, every friend must be made still more\\nher friend by them.  concern for her unhappiness,\\nand respect for her fortitude under it, must strengthen\\nevery attachment.  use your own discretion, however,\\nin communicating to her what i have told you.  you must\\nknow best what will be its effect; but had i not seriously,\\nand from my heart believed it might be of service,\\nmight lessen her regrets, i would not have suffered\\nmyself to trouble you with this account of my family\\nafflictions, with a recital which may seem to have been\\nintended to raise myself at the expense of others.\"\\n\\nelinor\\'s thanks followed this speech with grateful\\nearnestness; attended too with the assurance of her\\nexpecting material advantage to marianne, from the\\ncommunication of what had passed.\\n\\n\"i have been more pained,\" said she, \"by her\\nendeavors to acquit him than by all the rest; for it\\nirritates her mind more than the most perfect conviction\\nof his unworthiness can do.  now, though at first she\\nwill suffer much, i am sure she will soon become easier.\\nhave you,\" she continued, after a short silence,\\n\"ever seen mr. willoughby since you left him at barton?\"\\n\\n\"yes,\" he replied gravely, \"once i have.  one meeting\\nwas unavoidable.\"\\n\\nelinor, startled by his manner, looked at him anxiously,\\nsaying,\\n\\n\"what? have you met him to--\"\\n\\n\"i could meet him no other way.  eliza had confessed\\nto me, though most reluctantly, the name of her lover;\\nand when he returned to town, which was within a fortnight\\nafter myself, we met by appointment, he to defend,\\ni to punish his conduct.  we returned unwounded,\\nand the meeting, therefore, never got abroad.\"\\n\\nelinor sighed over the fancied necessity of this;\\nbut to a man and a soldier she presumed not to censure it.\\n\\n\"such,\" said colonel brandon, after a pause,\\n\"has been the unhappy resemblance between the fate of mother\\nand daughter! and so imperfectly have i discharged my trust!\"\\n\\n\"is she still in town?\"\\n\\n\"no; as soon as she recovered from her lying-in,\\nfor i found her near her delivery, i removed her and her\\nchild into the country, and there she remains.\"\\n\\nrecollecting, soon afterwards, that he was probably\\ndividing elinor from her sister, he put an end to his visit,\\nreceiving from her again the same grateful acknowledgments,\\nand leaving her full of compassion and esteem for him.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 32\\n\\n\\nwhen the particulars of this conversation were repeated\\nby miss dashwood to her sister, as they very soon were,\\nthe effect on her was not entirely such as the former\\nhad hoped to see.  not that marianne appeared to distrust\\nthe truth of any part of it, for she listened to it all\\nwith the most steady and submissive attention, made neither\\nobjection nor remark, attempted no vindication of willoughby,\\nand seemed to shew by her tears that she felt it to\\nbe impossible.  but though this behaviour assured elinor\\nthat the conviction of this guilt was carried home to\\nher mind, though she saw with satisfaction the effect of it,\\nin her no longer avoiding colonel brandon when he called,\\nin her speaking to him, even voluntarily speaking,\\nwith a kind of compassionate respect, and though she\\nsaw her spirits less violently irritated than before,\\nshe did not see her less wretched.  her mind did become\\nsettled, but it was settled in a gloomy dejection.\\nshe felt the loss of willoughby\\'s character yet more heavily\\nthan she had felt the loss of his heart; his seduction and\\ndesertion of miss williams, the misery of that poor girl,\\nand the doubt of what his designs might once have been\\non herself, preyed altogether so much on her spirits,\\nthat she could not bring herself to speak of what she felt\\neven to elinor; and, brooding over her sorrows in silence,\\ngave more pain to her sister than could have been communicated\\nby the most open and most frequent confession of them.\\n\\nto give the feelings or the language of mrs. dashwood\\non receiving and answering elinor\\'s letter would be only\\nto give a repetition of what her daughters had already felt\\nand said; of a disappointment hardly less painful than\\nmarianne\\'s, and an indignation even greater than elinor\\'s.\\nlong letters from her, quickly succeeding each other,\\narrived to tell all that she suffered and thought;\\nto express her anxious solicitude for marianne, and entreat\\nshe would bear up with fortitude under this misfortune.\\nbad indeed must the nature of marianne\\'s affliction be,\\nwhen her mother could talk of fortitude! mortifying\\nand humiliating must be the origin of those regrets,\\nwhich she could wish her not to indulge!\\n\\nagainst the interest of her own individual comfort,\\nmrs. dashwood had determined that it would be better for\\nmarianne to be any where, at that time, than at barton,\\nwhere every thing within her view would be bringing back\\nthe past in the strongest and most afflicting manner,\\nby constantly placing willoughby before her, such as\\nshe had always seen him there.  she recommended it to\\nher daughters, therefore, by all means not to shorten their\\nvisit to mrs. jennings; the length of which, though never\\nexactly fixed, had been expected by all to comprise at least\\nfive or six weeks.  a variety of occupations, of objects,\\nand of company, which could not be procured at barton,\\nwould be inevitable there, and might yet, she hoped,\\ncheat marianne, at times, into some interest beyond herself,\\nand even into some amusement, much as the ideas of both\\nmight now be spurned by her.\\n\\nfrom all danger of seeing willoughby again,\\nher mother considered her to be at least equally safe\\nin town as in the country, since his acquaintance must\\nnow be dropped by all who called themselves her friends.\\ndesign could never bring them in each other\\'s way:\\nnegligence could never leave them exposed to a surprise;\\nand chance had less in its favour in the crowd of london\\nthan even in the retirement of barton, where it might\\nforce him before her while paying that visit at allenham\\non his marriage, which mrs. dashwood, from foreseeing at\\nfirst as a probable event, had brought herself to expect\\nas a certain one.\\n\\nshe had yet another reason for wishing her children\\nto remain where they were; a letter from her son-in-law\\nhad told her that he and his wife were to be in town\\nbefore the middle of february, and she judged it right\\nthat they should sometimes see their brother.\\n\\nmarianne had promised to be guided by her mother\\'s opinion,\\nand she submitted to it therefore without opposition,\\nthough it proved perfectly different from what she wished\\nand expected, though she felt it to be entirely wrong,\\nformed on mistaken grounds, and that by requiring her\\nlonger continuance in london it deprived her of the only\\npossible alleviation of her wretchedness, the personal\\nsympathy of her mother, and doomed her to such society and\\nsuch scenes as must prevent her ever knowing a moment\\'s rest.\\n\\nbut it was a matter of great consolation to her,\\nthat what brought evil to herself would bring good to\\nher sister; and elinor, on the other hand, suspecting that\\nit would not be in her power to avoid edward entirely,\\ncomforted herself by thinking, that though their longer\\nstay would therefore militate against her own happiness,\\nit would be better for marianne than an immediate return\\ninto devonshire.\\n\\nher carefulness in guarding her sister from ever\\nhearing willoughby\\'s name mentioned, was not thrown away.\\nmarianne, though without knowing it herself, reaped all\\nits advantage; for neither mrs. jennings, nor sir john,\\nnor even mrs. palmer herself, ever spoke of him before her.\\nelinor wished that the same forbearance could have extended\\ntowards herself, but that was impossible, and she was\\nobliged to listen day after day to the indignation of them all.\\n\\nsir john, could not have thought it possible.\\n\"a man of whom he had always had such reason to think well!\\nsuch a good-natured fellow!  he did not believe there was a\\nbolder rider in england!  it was an unaccountable business.\\nhe wished him at the devil with all his heart.  he would\\nnot speak another word to him, meet him where he might,\\nfor all the world!  no, not if it were to be by the side\\nof barton covert, and they were kept watching for two\\nhours together.  such a scoundrel of a fellow! such\\na deceitful dog!  it was only the last time they met\\nthat he had offered him one of folly\\'s puppies! and this\\nwas the end of it!\"\\n\\nmrs. palmer, in her way, was equally angry.\\n\"she was determined to drop his acquaintance immediately,\\nand she was very thankful that she had never been acquainted\\nwith him at all.  she wished with all her heart combe\\nmagna was not so near cleveland; but it did not signify,\\nfor it was a great deal too far off to visit; she hated\\nhim so much that she was resolved never to mention\\nhis name again, and she should tell everybody she saw,\\nhow good-for-nothing he was.\"\\n\\nthe rest of mrs. palmer\\'s sympathy was shewn in procuring\\nall the particulars in her power of the approaching marriage,\\nand communicating them to elinor.  she could soon tell\\nat what coachmaker\\'s the new carriage was building,\\nby what painter mr. willoughby\\'s portrait was drawn,\\nand at what warehouse miss grey\\'s clothes might be seen.\\n\\nthe calm and polite unconcern of lady middleton\\non the occasion was a happy relief to elinor\\'s spirits,\\noppressed as they often were by the clamorous kindness\\nof the others.  it was a great comfort to her to be sure\\nof exciting no interest in one person at least among their\\ncircle of friends: a great comfort to know that there\\nwas one who would meet her without feeling any curiosity\\nafter particulars, or any anxiety for her sister\\'s health.\\n\\nevery qualification is raised at times, by the\\ncircumstances of the moment, to more than its real value;\\nand she was sometimes worried down by officious condolence\\nto rate good-breeding as more indispensable to comfort\\nthan good-nature.\\n\\nlady middleton expressed her sense of the affair\\nabout once every day, or twice, if the subject occurred\\nvery often, by saying, \"it is very shocking, indeed!\"\\nand by the means of this continual though gentle vent,\\nwas able not only to see the miss dashwoods from the\\nfirst without the smallest emotion, but very soon\\nto see them without recollecting a word of the matter;\\nand having thus supported the dignity of her own sex,\\nand spoken her decided censure of what was wrong\\nin the other, she thought herself at liberty to attend\\nto the interest of her own assemblies, and therefore\\ndetermined (though rather against the opinion of sir john)\\nthat as mrs. willoughby would at once be a woman of elegance\\nand fortune, to leave her card with her as soon as she married.\\n\\ncolonel brandon\\'s delicate, unobtrusive enquiries\\nwere never unwelcome to miss dashwood.  he had abundantly\\nearned the privilege of intimate discussion of her\\nsister\\'s disappointment, by the friendly zeal with\\nwhich he had endeavoured to soften it, and they always\\nconversed with confidence.  his chief reward for the\\npainful exertion of disclosing past sorrows and present\\nhumiliations, was given in the pitying eye with which\\nmarianne sometimes observed him, and the gentleness\\nof her voice whenever (though it did not often happen)\\nshe was obliged, or could oblige herself to speak to him.\\nthese assured him that his exertion had produced an\\nincrease of good-will towards himself, and these gave\\nelinor hopes of its being farther augmented hereafter;\\nbut mrs. jennings, who knew nothing of all this, who knew\\nonly that the colonel continued as grave as ever, and that\\nshe could neither prevail on him to make the offer himself,\\nnor commission her to make it for him, began, at the\\nend of two days, to think that, instead of midsummer,\\nthey would not be married till michaelmas, and by the\\nend of a week that it would not be a match at all.\\nthe good understanding between the colonel and miss\\ndashwood seemed rather to declare that the honours\\nof the mulberry-tree, the canal, and the yew arbour,\\nwould all be made over to her; and mrs. jennings had,\\nfor some time ceased to think at all of mrs. ferrars.\\n\\nearly in february, within a fortnight from the\\nreceipt of willoughby\\'s letter, elinor had the painful\\noffice of informing her sister that he was married.\\nshe had taken care to have the intelligence conveyed\\nto herself, as soon as it was known that the ceremony\\nwas over, as she was desirous that marianne should not\\nreceive the first notice of it from the public papers,\\nwhich she saw her eagerly examining every morning.\\n\\nshe received the news with resolute composure;\\nmade no observation on it, and at first shed no tears;\\nbut after a short time they would burst out, and for the\\nrest of the day, she was in a state hardly less pitiable\\nthan when she first learnt to expect the event.\\n\\nthe willoughbys left town as soon as they were married;\\nand elinor now hoped, as there could be no danger\\nof her seeing either of them, to prevail on her sister,\\nwho had never yet left the house since the blow first fell,\\nto go out again by degrees as she had done before.\\n\\nabout this time the two miss steeles, lately arrived\\nat their cousin\\'s house in bartlett\\'s buildings,\\nholburn, presented themselves again before their more\\ngrand relations in conduit and berkeley streets;\\nand were welcomed by them all with great cordiality.\\n\\nelinor only was sorry to see them.  their presence\\nalways gave her pain, and she hardly knew how to make\\na very gracious return to the overpowering delight of lucy\\nin finding her still in town.\\n\\n\"i should have been quite disappointed if i had not\\nfound you here still,\" said she repeatedly, with a strong\\nemphasis on the word.  \"but i always thought i should.\\ni was almost sure you would not leave london yet awhile;\\nthough you told me, you know, at barton, that you should\\nnot stay above a month.  but i thought, at the time,\\nthat you would most likely change your mind when it came\\nto the point.  it would have been such a great pity\\nto have went away before your brother and sister came.\\nand now to be sure you will be in no hurry to be gone.\\ni am amazingly glad you did not keep to your word.\"\\n\\nelinor perfectly understood her, and was forced\\nto use all her self-command to make it appear that she\\ndid not.\\n\\n\"well, my dear,\" said mrs. jennings, \"and how did\\nyou travel?\"\\n\\n\"not in the stage, i assure you,\" replied miss steele,\\nwith quick exultation; \"we came post all the way, and had\\na very smart beau to attend us.  dr. davies was coming\\nto town, and so we thought we\\'d join him in a post-chaise;\\nand he behaved very genteelly, and paid ten or twelve\\nshillings more than we did.\"\\n\\n\"oh, oh!\" cried mrs. jennings; \"very pretty,\\nindeed! and the doctor is a single man, i warrant you.\"\\n\\n\"there now,\" said miss steele, affectedly simpering,\\n\"everybody laughs at me so about the doctor, and i\\ncannot think why.  my cousins say they are sure i have\\nmade a conquest; but for my part i declare i never think\\nabout him from one hour\\'s end to another.  \\'lord! here\\ncomes your beau, nancy,\\' my cousin said t\\'other day,\\nwhen she saw him crossing the street to the house.\\nmy beau, indeed! said i--i cannot think who you mean.\\nthe doctor is no beau of mine.\"\\n\\n\"aye, aye, that is very pretty talking--but it won\\'t do--\\nthe doctor is the man, i see.\"\\n\\n\"no, indeed!\" replied her cousin, with affected earnestness,\\n\"and i beg you will contradict it, if you ever hear it talked\\nof.\"\\n\\nmrs. jennings directly gave her the gratifying\\nassurance that she certainly would not, and miss steele\\nwas made completely happy.\\n\\n\"i suppose you will go and stay with your brother\\nand sister, miss dashwood, when they come to town,\"\\nsaid lucy, returning, after a cessation of hostile hints,\\nto the charge.\\n\\n\"no, i do not think we shall.\"\\n\\n\"oh, yes, i dare say you will.\"\\n\\nelinor would not humour her by farther opposition.\\n\\n\"what a charming thing it is that mrs. dashwood can\\nspare you both for so long a time together!\"\\n\\n\"long a time, indeed!\" interposed mrs. jennings.\\n\"why, their visit is but just begun!\"\\n\\nlucy was silenced.\\n\\n\"i am sorry we cannot see your sister, miss dashwood,\"\\nsaid miss steele.  \"i am sorry she is not well--\"\\nfor marianne had left the room on their arrival.\\n\\n\"you are very good.  my sister will be equally\\nsorry to miss the pleasure of seeing you; but she has\\nbeen very much plagued lately with nervous head-aches,\\nwhich make her unfit for company or conversation.\"\\n\\n\"oh, dear, that is a great pity! but such old\\nfriends as lucy and me!--i think she might see us;\\nand i am sure we would not speak a word.\"\\n\\nelinor, with great civility, declined the proposal.\\nher sister was perhaps laid down upon the bed, or in her\\ndressing gown, and therefore not able to come to them.\\n\\n\"oh, if that\\'s all,\" cried miss steele, \"we can\\njust as well go and see her.\"\\n\\nelinor began to find this impertinence too much for\\nher temper; but she was saved the trouble of checking it,\\nby lucy\\'s sharp reprimand, which now, as on many occasions,\\nthough it did not give much sweetness to the manners\\nof one sister, was of advantage in governing those of\\nthe other.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 33\\n\\n\\nafter some opposition, marianne yielded to her\\nsister\\'s entreaties, and consented to go out with her\\nand mrs. jennings one morning for half an hour. she\\nexpressly conditioned, however, for paying no visits,\\nand would do no more than accompany them to gray\\'s in\\nsackville street, where elinor was carrying on a negotiation\\nfor the exchange of a few old-fashioned jewels of her mother.\\n\\nwhen they stopped at the door, mrs. jennings recollected\\nthat there was a lady at the other end of the street\\non whom she ought to call; and as she had no business\\nat gray\\'s, it was resolved, that while her young friends\\ntransacted their\\'s, she should pay her visit and\\nreturn for them.\\n\\non ascending the stairs, the miss dashwoods found\\nso many people before them in the room, that there was\\nnot a person at liberty to tend to their orders; and they\\nwere obliged to wait.  all that could be done was, to sit\\ndown at that end of the counter which seemed to promise the\\nquickest succession; one gentleman only was standing there,\\nand it is probable that elinor was not without hope\\nof exciting his politeness to a quicker despatch.\\nbut the correctness of his eye, and the delicacy\\nof his taste, proved to be beyond his politeness.\\nhe was giving orders for a toothpick-case for himself,\\nand till its size, shape, and ornaments were determined,\\nall of which, after examining and debating for a quarter\\nof an hour over every toothpick-case in the shop,\\nwere finally arranged by his own inventive fancy, he had\\nno leisure to bestow any other attention on the two ladies,\\nthan what was comprised in three or four very broad stares;\\na kind of notice which served to imprint on elinor\\nthe remembrance of a person and face, of strong,\\nnatural, sterling insignificance, though adorned in\\nthe first style of fashion.\\n\\nmarianne was spared from the troublesome feelings\\nof contempt and resentment, on this impertinent examination\\nof their features, and on the puppyism of his manner\\nin deciding on all the different horrors of the different\\ntoothpick-cases presented to his inspection, by remaining\\nunconscious of it all; for she was as well able to collect\\nher thoughts within herself, and be as ignorant of what was\\npassing around her, in mr. gray\\'s shop, as in her own bedroom.\\n\\nat last the affair was decided.  the ivory,\\nthe gold, and the pearls, all received their appointment,\\nand the gentleman having named the last day on which his\\nexistence could be continued without the possession of the\\ntoothpick-case, drew on his gloves with leisurely care,\\nand bestowing another glance on the miss dashwoods, but such\\na one as seemed rather to demand than express admiration,\\nwalked off with a happy air of real conceit and affected\\nindifference.\\n\\nelinor lost no time in bringing her business forward,\\nwas on the point of concluding it, when another gentleman\\npresented himself at her side.  she turned her eyes towards\\nhis face, and found him with some surprise to be her brother.\\n\\ntheir affection and pleasure in meeting was just enough\\nto make a very creditable appearance in mr. gray\\'s shop.\\njohn dashwood was really far from being sorry to see\\nhis sisters again; it rather gave them satisfaction;\\nand his inquiries after their mother were respectful\\nand attentive.\\n\\nelinor found that he and fanny had been in town\\ntwo days.\\n\\n\"i wished very much to call upon you yesterday,\"\\nsaid he, \"but it was impossible, for we were obliged\\nto take harry to see the wild beasts at exeter exchange;\\nand we spent the rest of the day with mrs. ferrars.\\nharry was vastly pleased.  this morning i had fully intended\\nto call on you, if i could possibly find a spare half hour,\\nbut one has always so much to do on first coming to town.\\ni am come here to bespeak fanny a seal.  but tomorrow i\\nthink i shall certainly be able to call in berkeley street,\\nand be introduced to your friend mrs. jennings.\\ni understand she is a woman of very good fortune.\\nand the middletons too, you must introduce me to them.\\nas my mother-in-law\\'s relations, i shall be happy to show\\nthem every respect.  they are excellent neighbours to you in\\nthe country, i understand.\"\\n\\n\"excellent indeed.  their attention to our comfort,\\ntheir friendliness in every particular, is more than i\\ncan express.\"\\n\\n\"i am extremely glad to hear it, upon my word;\\nextremely glad indeed.  but so it ought to be; they are\\npeople of large fortune, they are related to you, and\\nevery civility and accommodation that can serve to make\\nyour situation pleasant might be reasonably expected.\\nand so you are most comfortably settled in your little cottage\\nand want for nothing!  edward brought us a most charming\\naccount of the place: the most complete thing of its kind,\\nhe said, that ever was, and you all seemed to enjoy it beyond\\nany thing.  it was a great satisfaction to us to hear it,\\ni assure you.\"\\n\\nelinor did feel a little ashamed of her brother;\\nand was not sorry to be spared the necessity of answering him,\\nby the arrival of mrs. jennings\\'s servant, who came to tell\\nher that his mistress waited for them at the door.\\n\\nmr. dashwood attended them down stairs, was introduced\\nto mrs. jennings at the door of her carriage, and repeating\\nhis hope of being able to call on them the next day,\\ntook leave.\\n\\nhis visit was duly paid.  he came with a pretence at\\nan apology from their sister-in-law, for not coming too;\\n\"but she was so much engaged with her mother, that really\\nshe had no leisure for going any where.\"  mrs. jennings,\\nhowever, assured him directly, that she should not stand\\nupon ceremony, for they were all cousins, or something\\nlike it, and she should certainly wait on mrs. john\\ndashwood very soon, and bring her sisters to see her.\\nhis manners to them, though calm, were perfectly kind;\\nto mrs. jennings, most attentively civil; and on colonel\\nbrandon\\'s coming in soon after himself, he eyed him with a\\ncuriosity which seemed to say, that he only wanted to know\\nhim to be rich, to be equally civil to him.\\n\\nafter staying with them half an hour, he asked\\nelinor to walk with him to conduit street, and introduce\\nhim to sir john and lady middleton.  the weather was\\nremarkably fine, and she readily consented.  as soon\\nas they were out of the house, his enquiries began.\\n\\n\"who is colonel brandon?  is he a man of fortune?\"\\n\\n\"yes; he has very good property in dorsetshire.\"\\n\\n\"i am glad of it.  he seems a most gentlemanlike man;\\nand i think, elinor, i may congratulate you on the prospect\\nof a very respectable establishment in life.\"\\n\\n\"me, brother! what do you mean?\"\\n\\n\"he likes you.  i observed him narrowly, and am\\nconvinced of it.  what is the amount of his fortune?\"\\n\\n\"i believe about two thousand a year.\"\\n\\n\"two thousand a-year;\" and then working himself\\nup to a pitch of enthusiastic generosity, he added,\\n\"elinor, i wish with all my heart it were twice as much,\\nfor your sake.\"\\n\\n\"indeed i believe you,\" replied elinor; \"but i am\\nvery sure that colonel brandon has not the smallest wish\\nof marrying me.\"\\n\\n\"you are mistaken, elinor; you are very much mistaken.\\na very little trouble on your side secures him.\\nperhaps just at present he may be undecided; the smallness\\nof your fortune may make him hang back; his friends\\nmay all advise him against it.  but some of those little\\nattentions and encouragements which ladies can so easily\\ngive will fix him, in spite of himself.  and there can be\\nno reason why you should not try for him.  it is not to be\\nsupposed that any prior attachment on your side--in short,\\nyou know as to an attachment of that kind, it is quite\\nout of the question, the objections are insurmountable--\\nyou have too much sense not to see all that.  colonel brandon\\nmust be the man; and no civility shall be wanting on\\nmy part to make him pleased with you and your family.\\nit is a match that must give universal satisfaction.\\nin short, it is a kind of thing that\"--lowering his voice\\nto an important whisper--\"will be exceedingly welcome\\nto all parties.\" recollecting himself, however, he added,\\n\"that is, i mean to say--your friends are all truly\\nanxious to see you well settled; fanny particularly,\\nfor she has your interest very much at heart, i assure you.\\nand her mother too, mrs. ferrars, a very good-natured woman,\\ni am sure it would give her great pleasure; she said as much\\nthe other day.\"\\n\\nelinor would not vouchsafe any answer.\\n\\n\"it would be something remarkable, now,\" he continued,\\n\"something droll, if fanny should have a brother and i\\na sister settling at the same time.  and yet it is not\\nvery unlikely.\"\\n\\n\"is mr. edward ferrars,\" said elinor, with resolution,\\n\"going to be married?\"\\n\\n\"it is not actually settled, but there is such\\na thing in agitation.  he has a most excellent mother.\\nmrs. ferrars, with the utmost liberality, will come forward,\\nand settle on him a thousand a year, if the match\\ntakes place.  the lady is the hon. miss morton, only daughter\\nof the late lord morton, with thirty thousand pounds.\\na very desirable connection on both sides, and i have not\\na doubt of its taking place in time.  a thousand a-year\\nis a great deal for a mother to give away, to make over\\nfor ever; but mrs. ferrars has a noble spirit.  to give\\nyou another instance of her liberality:--the other day,\\nas soon as we came to town, aware that money could\\nnot be very plenty with us just now, she put bank-notes\\ninto fanny\\'s hands to the amount of two hundred pounds.\\nand extremely acceptable it is, for we must live at a great\\nexpense while we are here.\"\\n\\nhe paused for her assent and compassion; and she\\nforced herself to say,\\n\\n\"your expenses both in town and country must certainly\\nbe considerable; but your income is a large one.\"\\n\\n\"not so large, i dare say, as many people suppose.\\ni do not mean to complain, however; it is undoubtedly\\na comfortable one, and i hope will in time be better.\\nthe enclosure of norland common, now carrying on,\\nis a most serious drain.  and then i have made a little\\npurchase within this half year; east kingham farm,\\nyou must remember the place, where old gibson used to live.\\nthe land was so very desirable for me in every respect,\\nso immediately adjoining my own property, that i felt it\\nmy duty to buy it.  i could not have answered it to my\\nconscience to let it fall into any other hands.  a man must\\npay for his convenience; and it has cost me a vast deal\\nof money.\"\\n\\n\"more than you think it really and intrinsically worth.\"\\n\\n\"why, i hope not that.  i might have sold it again,\\nthe next day, for more than i gave: but, with regard to the\\npurchase-money, i might have been very unfortunate indeed;\\nfor the stocks were at that time so low, that if i had not\\nhappened to have the necessary sum in my banker\\'s hands,\\ni must have sold out to very great loss.\"\\n\\nelinor could only smile.\\n\\n\"other great and inevitable expenses too we have\\nhad on first coming to norland.  our respected father,\\nas you well know, bequeathed all the stanhill effects\\nthat remained at norland (and very valuable they were)\\nto your mother.  far be it from me to repine at his\\ndoing so; he had an undoubted right to dispose of his\\nown property as he chose, but, in consequence of it,\\nwe have been obliged to make large purchases of linen,\\nchina, &c. to supply the place of what was taken away.\\nyou may guess, after all these expenses, how very far we\\nmust be from being rich, and how acceptable mrs. ferrars\\'s\\nkindness is.\"\\n\\n\"certainly,\" said elinor; \"and assisted by her liberality,\\ni hope you may yet live to be in easy circumstances.\"\\n\\n\"another year or two may do much towards it,\"\\nhe gravely replied; \"but however there is still a great\\ndeal to be done.  there is not a stone laid of fanny\\'s\\ngreen-house, and nothing but the plan of the flower-garden\\nmarked out.\"\\n\\n\"where is the green-house to be?\"\\n\\n\"upon the knoll behind the house.  the old\\nwalnut trees are all come down to make room for it.\\nit will be a very fine object from many parts of the park,\\nand the flower-garden will slope down just before it,\\nand be exceedingly pretty.  we have cleared away all the old\\nthorns that grew in patches over the brow.\"\\n\\nelinor kept her concern and her censure to herself;\\nand was very thankful that marianne was not present,\\nto share the provocation.\\n\\nhaving now said enough to make his poverty clear,\\nand to do away the necessity of buying a pair of ear-rings\\nfor each of his sisters, in his next visit at gray\\'s\\nhis thoughts took a cheerfuller turn, and he began to\\ncongratulate elinor on having such a friend as mrs. jennings.\\n\\n\"she seems a most valuable woman indeed--her house,\\nher style of living, all bespeak an exceeding good income;\\nand it is an acquaintance that has not only been\\nof great use to you hitherto, but in the end may prove\\nmaterially advantageous.--her inviting you to town is\\ncertainly a vast thing in your favour; and indeed, it\\nspeaks altogether so great a regard for you, that in all\\nprobability when she dies you will not be forgotten.--\\nshe must have a great deal to leave.\"\\n\\n\"nothing at all, i should rather suppose; for she has\\nonly her jointure, which will descend to her children.\"\\n\\n\"but it is not to be imagined that she lives up to\\nher income.  few people of common prudence will do that;\\nand whatever she saves, she will be able to dispose of.\"\\n\\n\"and do you not think it more likely that she\\nshould leave it to her daughters, than to us?\"\\n\\n\"her daughters are both exceedingly well married,\\nand therefore i cannot perceive the necessity of her\\nremembering them farther.  whereas, in my opinion, by her\\ntaking so much notice of you, and treating you in this\\nkind of way, she has given you a sort of claim on her\\nfuture consideration, which a conscientious woman would\\nnot disregard.  nothing can be kinder than her behaviour;\\nand she can hardly do all this, without being aware\\nof the expectation it raises.\"\\n\\n\"but she raises none in those most concerned.\\nindeed, brother, your anxiety for our welfare and prosperity\\ncarries you too far.\"\\n\\n\"why, to be sure,\" said he, seeming to recollect himself,\\n\"people have little, have very little in their power.\\nbut, my dear elinor, what is the matter with marianne?--\\nshe looks very unwell, has lost her colour, and is grown\\nquite thin.  is she ill?\"\\n\\n\"she is not well, she has had a nervous complaint\\non her for several weeks.\"\\n\\n\"i am sorry for that.  at her time of life,\\nany thing of an illness destroys the bloom for ever!\\nher\\'s has been a very short one!  she was as handsome a girl\\nlast september, as i ever saw; and as likely to attract\\nthe man.  there was something in her style of beauty,\\nto please them particularly.  i remember fanny used to say\\nthat she would marry sooner and better than you did;\\nnot but what she is exceedingly fond of you, but so it\\nhappened to strike her.  she will be mistaken, however.\\ni question whether marianne now, will marry a man worth\\nmore than five or six hundred a-year, at the utmost,\\nand i am very much deceived if you do not do better.\\ndorsetshire!  i know very little of dorsetshire; but, my dear\\nelinor, i shall be exceedingly glad to know more of it;\\nand i think i can answer for your having fanny and myself\\namong the earliest and best pleased of your visitors.\"\\n\\nelinor tried very seriously to convince him that\\nthere was no likelihood of her marrying colonel brandon;\\nbut it was an expectation of too much pleasure to himself\\nto be relinquished, and he was really resolved on seeking\\nan intimacy with that gentleman, and promoting the marriage\\nby every possible attention.  he had just compunction\\nenough for having done nothing for his sisters himself,\\nto be exceedingly anxious that everybody else should\\ndo a great deal; and an offer from colonel brandon,\\nor a legacy from mrs. jennings, was the easiest means\\nof atoning for his own neglect.\\n\\nthey were lucky enough to find lady middleton\\nat home, and sir john came in before their visit ended.\\nabundance of civilities passed on all sides.  sir john\\nwas ready to like anybody, and though mr. dashwood did\\nnot seem to know much about horses, he soon set him\\ndown as a very good-natured fellow: while lady middleton\\nsaw enough of fashion in his appearance to think his\\nacquaintance worth having; and mr. dashwood went away\\ndelighted with both.\\n\\n\"i shall have a charming account to carry\\nto fanny,\" said he, as he walked back with his sister.\\n\"lady middleton is really a most elegant woman!  such\\na woman as i am sure fanny will be glad to know.\\nand mrs. jennings too, an exceedingly well-behaved woman,\\nthough not so elegant as her daughter.  your sister need\\nnot have any scruple even of visiting her, which, to say\\nthe truth, has been a little the case, and very naturally;\\nfor we only knew that mrs. jennings was the widow of a man\\nwho had got all his money in a low way; and fanny and\\nmrs. ferrars were both strongly prepossessed, that neither\\nshe nor her daughters were such kind of women as fanny\\nwould like to associate with.  but now i can carry her\\na most satisfactory account of both.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 34\\n\\n\\nmrs. john dashwood had so much confidence in her\\nhusband\\'s judgment, that she waited the very next day\\nboth on mrs. jennings and her daughter; and her\\nconfidence was rewarded by finding even the former,\\neven the woman with whom her sisters were staying,\\nby no means unworthy her notice; and as for lady middleton,\\nshe found her one of the most charming women in the world!\\n\\nlady middleton was equally pleased with mrs. dashwood.\\nthere was a kind of cold hearted selfishness on both sides,\\nwhich mutually attracted them; and they sympathised\\nwith each other in an insipid propriety of demeanor,\\nand a general want of understanding.\\n\\nthe same manners, however, which recommended mrs. john\\ndashwood to the good opinion of lady middleton did not suit\\nthe fancy of mrs. jennings, and to her she appeared nothing\\nmore than a little proud-looking woman of uncordial address,\\nwho met her husband\\'s sisters without any affection,\\nand almost without having anything to say to them;\\nfor of the quarter of an hour bestowed on berkeley street,\\nshe sat at least seven minutes and a half in silence.\\n\\nelinor wanted very much to know, though she did\\nnot chuse to ask, whether edward was then in town;\\nbut nothing would have induced fanny voluntarily\\nto mention his name before her, till able to tell her\\nthat his marriage with miss morton was resolved on,\\nor till her husband\\'s expectations on colonel brandon\\nwere answered; because she believed them still so very\\nmuch attached to each other, that they could not be too\\nsedulously divided in word and deed on every occasion.\\nthe intelligence however, which she would not give,\\nsoon flowed from another quarter.  lucy came very shortly\\nto claim elinor\\'s compassion on being unable to see edward,\\nthough he had arrived in town with mr. and mrs. dashwood.\\nhe dared not come to bartlett\\'s buildings for fear\\nof detection, and though their mutual impatience to meet,\\nwas not to be told, they could do nothing at present\\nbut write.\\n\\nedward assured them himself of his being in town,\\nwithin a very short time, by twice calling in berkeley street.\\ntwice was his card found on the table, when they returned\\nfrom their morning\\'s engagements.  elinor was pleased\\nthat he had called; and still more pleased that she had\\nmissed him.\\n\\nthe dashwoods were so prodigiously delighted\\nwith the middletons, that, though not much in the habit\\nof giving anything, they determined to give them--\\na dinner; and soon after their acquaintance began,\\ninvited them to dine in harley street, where they had\\ntaken a very good house for three months.  their sisters\\nand mrs. jennings were invited likewise, and john dashwood\\nwas careful to secure colonel brandon, who, always glad\\nto be where the miss dashwoods were, received his eager\\ncivilities with some surprise, but much more pleasure.\\nthey were to meet mrs. ferrars; but elinor could not learn\\nwhether her sons were to be of the party.  the expectation\\nof seeing her, however, was enough to make her interested\\nin the engagement; for though she could now meet edward\\'s\\nmother without that strong anxiety which had once promised\\nto attend such an introduction, though she could now see\\nher with perfect indifference as to her opinion of herself,\\nher desire of being in company with mrs. ferrars,\\nher curiosity to know what she was like, was as lively as ever.\\n\\nthe interest with which she thus anticipated the\\nparty, was soon afterwards increased, more powerfully\\nthan pleasantly, by her hearing that the miss steeles\\nwere also to be at it.\\n\\nso well had they recommended themselves to lady middleton,\\nso agreeable had their assiduities made them to her,\\nthat though lucy was certainly not so elegant, and her\\nsister not even genteel, she was as ready as sir john\\nto ask them to spend a week or two in conduit street;\\nand it happened to be particularly convenient to the miss\\nsteeles, as soon as the dashwoods\\' invitation was known,\\nthat their visit should begin a few days before the party\\ntook place.\\n\\ntheir claims to the notice of mrs. john dashwood,\\nas the nieces of the gentleman who for many years had\\nhad the care of her brother, might not have done much,\\nhowever, towards procuring them seats at her table;\\nbut as lady middleton\\'s guests they must be welcome; and lucy,\\nwho had long wanted to be personally known to the family,\\nto have a nearer view of their characters and her own\\ndifficulties, and to have an opportunity of endeavouring\\nto please them, had seldom been happier in her life,\\nthan she was on receiving mrs. john dashwood\\'s card.\\n\\non elinor its effect was very different.  she began\\nimmediately to determine, that edward who lived with\\nhis mother, must be asked as his mother was, to a party\\ngiven by his sister; and to see him for the first time,\\nafter all that passed, in the company of lucy!--she hardly\\nknew how she could bear it!\\n\\nthese apprehensions, perhaps, were not founded\\nentirely on reason, and certainly not at all on truth.\\nthey were relieved however, not by her own recollection,\\nbut by the good will of lucy, who believed herself to be\\ninflicting a severe disappointment when she told her\\nthat edward certainly would not be in harley street on tuesday,\\nand even hoped to be carrying the pain still farther\\nby persuading her that he was kept away by the extreme\\naffection for herself, which he could not conceal when they\\nwere together.\\n\\nthe important tuesday came that was to introduce\\nthe two young ladies to this formidable mother-in-law.\\n\\n\"pity me, dear miss dashwood!\" said lucy, as they\\nwalked up the stairs together--for the middletons arrived\\nso directly after mrs. jennings, that they all followed\\nthe servant at the same time--\"there is nobody here but\\nyou, that can feel for me.--i declare i can hardly stand.\\ngood gracious!--in a moment i shall see the person that all\\nmy happiness depends on--that is to be my mother!\"--\\n\\nelinor could have given her immediate relief\\nby suggesting the possibility of its being miss morton\\'s mother,\\nrather than her own, whom they were about to behold;\\nbut instead of doing that, she assured her, and with\\ngreat sincerity, that she did pity her--to the utter\\namazement of lucy, who, though really uncomfortable herself,\\nhoped at least to be an object of irrepressible envy to elinor.\\n\\nmrs. ferrars was a little, thin woman, upright,\\neven to formality, in her figure, and serious,\\neven to sourness, in her aspect.  her complexion was sallow;\\nand her features small, without beauty, and naturally\\nwithout expression; but a lucky contraction of the brow\\nhad rescued her countenance from the disgrace of insipidity,\\nby giving it the strong characters of pride and ill nature.\\nshe was not a woman of many words; for, unlike people\\nin general, she proportioned them to the number of\\nher ideas; and of the few syllables that did escape her,\\nnot one fell to the share of miss dashwood, whom she eyed\\nwith the spirited determination of disliking her at all events.\\n\\nelinor could not now be made unhappy by this behaviour.--\\na few months ago it would have hurt her exceedingly; but it\\nwas not in mrs. ferrars\\' power to distress her by it now;--\\nand the difference of her manners to the miss steeles,\\na difference which seemed purposely made to humble her more,\\nonly amused her.  she could not but smile to see the graciousness\\nof both mother and daughter towards the very person--\\nfor lucy was particularly distinguished--whom of all others,\\nhad they known as much as she did, they would have been most\\nanxious to mortify; while she herself, who had comparatively\\nno power to wound them, sat pointedly slighted by both.\\nbut while she smiled at a graciousness so misapplied,\\nshe could not reflect on the mean-spirited folly from\\nwhich it sprung, nor observe the studied attentions\\nwith which the miss steeles courted its continuance,\\nwithout thoroughly despising them all four.\\n\\nlucy was all exultation on being so honorably\\ndistinguished; and miss steele wanted only to be teazed\\nabout dr. davies to be perfectly happy.\\n\\nthe dinner was a grand one, the servants were numerous,\\nand every thing bespoke the mistress\\'s inclination\\nfor show, and the master\\'s ability to support it.\\nin spite of the improvements and additions which were\\nmaking to the norland estate, and in spite of its owner\\nhaving once been within some thousand pounds of being\\nobliged to sell out at a loss, nothing gave any symptom\\nof that indigence which he had tried to infer from it;--\\nno poverty of any kind, except of conversation, appeared--\\nbut there, the deficiency was considerable.  john dashwood\\nhad not much to say for himself that was worth hearing,\\nand his wife had still less.  but there was no peculiar\\ndisgrace in this; for it was very much the case with\\nthe chief of their visitors, who almost all laboured\\nunder one or other of these disqualifications for being\\nagreeable--want of sense, either natural or improved--want\\nof elegance--want of spirits--or want of temper.\\n\\nwhen the ladies withdrew to the drawing-room\\nafter dinner, this poverty was particularly evident,\\nfor the gentlemen had supplied the discourse with some\\nvariety--the variety of politics, inclosing land,\\nand breaking horses--but then it was all over; and one\\nsubject only engaged the ladies till coffee came in,\\nwhich was the comparative heights of harry dashwood,\\nand lady middleton\\'s second son william, who were nearly\\nof the same age.\\n\\nhad both the children been there, the affair might\\nhave been determined too easily by measuring them at once;\\nbut as harry only was present, it was all conjectural\\nassertion on both sides; and every body had a right to\\nbe equally positive in their opinion, and to repeat it\\nover and over again as often as they liked.\\n\\nthe parties stood thus:\\n\\nthe two mothers, though each really convinced that\\nher own son was the tallest, politely decided in favour\\nof the other.\\n\\nthe two grandmothers, with not less partiality,\\nbut more sincerity, were equally earnest in support\\nof their own descendant.\\n\\nlucy, who was hardly less anxious to please one parent\\nthan the other, thought the boys were both remarkably tall\\nfor their age, and could not conceive that there could\\nbe the smallest difference in the world between them;\\nand miss steele, with yet greater address gave it,\\nas fast as she could, in favour of each.\\n\\nelinor, having once delivered her opinion on\\nwilliam\\'s side, by which she offended mrs. ferrars and\\nfanny still more, did not see the necessity of enforcing\\nit by any farther assertion; and marianne, when called\\non for her\\'s, offended them all, by declaring that she\\nhad no opinion to give, as she had never thought about it.\\n\\nbefore her removing from norland, elinor had painted\\na very pretty pair of screens for her sister-in-law,\\nwhich being now just mounted and brought home,\\nornamented her present drawing room; and these screens,\\ncatching the eye of john dashwood on his following\\nthe other gentlemen into the room, were officiously\\nhanded by him to colonel brandon for his admiration.\\n\\n\"these are done by my eldest sister,\" said he; \"and you,\\nas a man of taste, will, i dare say, be pleased with them.\\ni do not know whether you have ever happened to see any\\nof her performances before, but she is in general reckoned\\nto draw extremely well.\"\\n\\nthe colonel, though disclaiming all pretensions\\nto connoisseurship, warmly admired the screens, as he\\nwould have done any thing painted by miss dashwood;\\nand on the curiosity of the others being of course excited,\\nthey were handed round for general inspection.\\nmrs. ferrars, not aware of their being elinor\\'s work,\\nparticularly requested to look at them; and after they had\\nreceived gratifying testimony of lady middletons\\'s approbation,\\nfanny presented them to her mother, considerately informing\\nher, at the same time, that they were done by miss dashwood.\\n\\n\"hum\"--said mrs. ferrars--\"very pretty,\"--and without\\nregarding them at all, returned them to her daughter.\\n\\nperhaps fanny thought for a moment that her mother\\nhad been quite rude enough,--for, colouring a little,\\nshe immediately said,\\n\\n\"they are very pretty, ma\\'am--an\\'t they?\" but then again,\\nthe dread of having been too civil, too encouraging herself,\\nprobably came over her, for she presently added,\\n\\n\"do you not think they are something in miss\\nmorton\\'s style of painting, ma\\'am?--she does paint most\\ndelightfully!--how beautifully her last landscape is done!\"\\n\\n\"beautifully indeed!  but she does every thing well.\"\\n\\nmarianne could not bear this.--she was already\\ngreatly displeased with mrs. ferrars; and such ill-timed\\npraise of another, at elinor\\'s expense, though she\\nhad not any notion of what was principally meant by it,\\nprovoked her immediately to say with warmth,\\n\\n\"this is admiration of a very particular kind!--\\nwhat is miss morton to us?--who knows, or who cares,\\nfor her?--it is elinor of whom we think and speak.\"\\n\\nand so saying, she took the screens out of her\\nsister-in-law\\'s hands, to admire them herself as they\\nought to be admired.\\n\\nmrs. ferrars looked exceedingly angry, and drawing\\nherself up more stiffly than ever, pronounced in retort\\nthis bitter philippic, \"miss morton is lord morton\\'s daughter.\"\\n\\nfanny looked very angry too, and her husband was\\nall in a fright at his sister\\'s audacity.  elinor was\\nmuch more hurt by marianne\\'s warmth than she had been\\nby what produced it; but colonel brandon\\'s eyes, as they\\nwere fixed on marianne, declared that he noticed only\\nwhat was amiable in it, the affectionate heart which could\\nnot bear to see a sister slighted in the smallest point.\\n\\nmarianne\\'s feelings did not stop here.  the cold\\ninsolence of mrs. ferrars\\'s general behaviour to her sister,\\nseemed, to her, to foretell such difficulties and distresses\\nto elinor, as her own wounded heart taught her to think\\nof with horror; and urged by a strong impulse of\\naffectionate sensibility, she moved after a moment,\\nto her sister\\'s chair, and putting one arm round her neck,\\nand one cheek close to hers, said in a low, but eager,\\nvoice,\\n\\n\"dear, dear elinor, don\\'t mind them.  don\\'t let them\\nmake you unhappy.\"\\n\\nshe could say no more; her spirits were quite overcome,\\nand hiding her face on elinor\\'s shoulder, she burst\\ninto tears.  every body\\'s attention was called, and almost\\nevery body was concerned.--colonel brandon rose up and went\\nto them without knowing what he did.--mrs. jennings,\\nwith a very intelligent \"ah! poor dear,\" immediately gave\\nher her salts; and sir john felt so desperately enraged\\nagainst the author of this nervous distress, that he\\ninstantly changed his seat to one close by lucy steele,\\nand gave her, in a whisper, a brief account of the whole\\nshocking affair.\\n\\nin a few minutes, however, marianne was recovered\\nenough to put an end to the bustle, and sit down among\\nthe rest; though her spirits retained the impression\\nof what had passed, the whole evening.\\n\\n\"poor marianne!\" said her brother to colonel brandon,\\nin a low voice, as soon as he could secure his attention,--\\n\"she has not such good health as her sister,--she is very\\nnervous,--she has not elinor\\'s constitution;--and one must\\nallow that there is something very trying to a young woman\\nwho has been a beauty in the loss of her personal attractions.\\nyou would not think it perhaps, but marianne was remarkably\\nhandsome a few months ago; quite as handsome as elinor.--\\nnow you see it is all gone.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 35\\n\\n\\nelinor\\'s curiosity to see mrs. ferrars was satisfied.--\\nshe had found in her every thing that could tend to make\\na farther connection between the families undesirable.--\\nshe had seen enough of her pride, her meanness, and her\\ndetermined prejudice against herself, to comprehend all\\nthe difficulties that must have perplexed the engagement,\\nand retarded the marriage, of edward and herself, had he been\\notherwise free;--and she had seen almost enough to be thankful\\nfor her own sake, that one greater obstacle preserved her\\nfrom suffering under any other of mrs. ferrars\\'s creation,\\npreserved her from all dependence upon her caprice, or any\\nsolicitude for her good opinion.  or at least, if she did not\\nbring herself quite to rejoice in edward\\'s being fettered\\nto lucy, she determined, that had lucy been more amiable,\\nshe ought to have rejoiced.\\n\\nshe wondered that lucy\\'s spirits could be so very much\\nelevated by the civility of mrs. ferrars;--that her interest\\nand her vanity should so very much blind her as to make\\nthe attention which seemed only paid her because she was\\nnot elinor, appear a compliment to herself--or to allow\\nher to derive encouragement from a preference only given her,\\nbecause her real situation was unknown.  but that it was so,\\nhad not only been declared by lucy\\'s eyes at the time,\\nbut was declared over again the next morning more openly,\\nfor at her particular desire, lady middleton set her down\\nin berkeley street on the chance of seeing elinor alone,\\nto tell her how happy she was.\\n\\nthe chance proved a lucky one, for a message from\\nmrs. palmer soon after she arrived, carried mrs. jennings away.\\n\\n\"my dear friend,\" cried lucy, as soon as they were\\nby themselves, \"i come to talk to you of my happiness.\\ncould anything be so flattering as mrs. ferrars\\'s way\\nof treating me yesterday?  so exceeding affable as she\\nwas!--you know how i dreaded the thoughts of seeing her;--\\nbut the very moment i was introduced, there was such an\\naffability in her behaviour as really should seem to say,\\nshe had quite took a fancy to me.  now was not it so?--\\nyou saw it all; and was not you quite struck with it?\"\\n\\n\"she was certainly very civil to you.\"\\n\\n\"civil!--did you see nothing but only civility?--\\ni saw a vast deal more.  such kindness as fell to the share\\nof nobody but me!--no pride, no hauteur, and your sister\\njust the same--all sweetness and affability!\"\\n\\nelinor wished to talk of something else, but lucy still\\npressed her to own that she had reason for her happiness;\\nand elinor was obliged to go on.--\\n\\n\"undoubtedly, if they had known your engagement,\"\\nsaid she, \"nothing could be more flattering than their\\ntreatment of you;--but as that was not the case\"--\\n\\n\"i guessed you would say so\"--replied lucy\\nquickly--\"but there was no reason in the world why\\nmrs. ferrars should seem to like me, if she did not,\\nand her liking me is every thing.  you shan\\'t talk me\\nout of my satisfaction.  i am sure it will all end well,\\nand there will be no difficulties at all, to what i\\nused to think.  mrs. ferrars is a charming woman,\\nand so is your sister.  they are both delightful women,\\nindeed!--i wonder i should never hear you say how agreeable\\nmrs. dashwood was!\"\\n\\nto this elinor had no answer to make, and did not\\nattempt any.\\n\\n\"are you ill, miss dashwood?--you seem low--you\\ndon\\'t speak;--sure you an\\'t well.\"\\n\\n\"i never was in better health.\"\\n\\n\"i am glad of it with all my heart; but really you did\\nnot look it.  i should be sorry to have you ill; you, that have\\nbeen the greatest comfort to me in the world!--heaven\\nknows what i should have done without your friendship.\"--\\n\\nelinor tried to make a civil answer, though doubting\\nher own success.  but it seemed to satisfy lucy, for she\\ndirectly replied,\\n\\n\"indeed i am perfectly convinced of your regard\\nfor me, and next to edward\\'s love, it is the greatest\\ncomfort i have.--poor edward!--but now there is one\\ngood thing, we shall be able to meet, and meet pretty often,\\nfor lady middleton\\'s delighted with mrs. dashwood,\\nso we shall be a good deal in harley street, i dare say,\\nand edward spends half his time with his sister--besides,\\nlady middleton and mrs. ferrars will visit now;--\\nand mrs. ferrars and your sister were both so good to say\\nmore than once, they should always be glad to see me.--\\nthey are such charming women!--i am sure if ever you\\ntell your sister what i think of her, you cannot speak\\ntoo high.\"\\n\\nbut elinor would not give her any encouragement\\nto hope that she should tell her sister.  lucy continued.\\n\\n\"i am sure i should have seen it in a moment,\\nif mrs. ferrars had took a dislike to me.  if she had only\\nmade me a formal courtesy, for instance, without saying\\na word, and never after had took any notice of me,\\nand never looked at me in a pleasant way--you know\\nwhat i mean--if i had been treated in that forbidding\\nsort of way, i should have gave it all up in despair.\\ni could not have stood it.  for where she does dislike,\\ni know it is most violent.\"\\n\\nelinor was prevented from making any reply to this\\ncivil triumph, by the door\\'s being thrown open, the servant\\'s\\nannouncing mr. ferrars, and edward\\'s immediately walking in.\\n\\nit was a very awkward moment; and the countenance of each\\nshewed that it was so.  they all looked exceedingly foolish;\\nand edward seemed to have as great an inclination to walk\\nout of the room again, as to advance farther into it.\\nthe very circumstance, in its unpleasantest form,\\nwhich they would each have been most anxious to avoid,\\nhad fallen on them.--they were not only all three together,\\nbut were together without the relief of any other person.\\nthe ladies recovered themselves first.  it was not lucy\\'s\\nbusiness to put herself forward, and the appearance of\\nsecrecy must still be kept up.  she could therefore only\\nlook her tenderness, and after slightly addressing him,\\nsaid no more.\\n\\nbut elinor had more to do; and so anxious was she,\\nfor his sake and her own, to do it well, that she\\nforced herself, after a moment\\'s recollection,\\nto welcome him, with a look and manner that were almost easy,\\nand almost open; and another struggle, another effort still\\nimproved them.  she would not allow the presence of lucy,\\nnor the consciousness of some injustice towards herself,\\nto deter her from saying that she was happy to see him,\\nand that she had very much regretted being from home,\\nwhen he called before in berkeley street.  she would\\nnot be frightened from paying him those attentions which,\\nas a friend and almost a relation, were his due, by the\\nobservant eyes of lucy, though she soon perceived them\\nto be narrowly watching her.\\n\\nher manners gave some re-assurance to edward, and he\\nhad courage enough to sit down; but his embarrassment still\\nexceeded that of the ladies in a proportion, which the case\\nrendered reasonable, though his sex might make it rare;\\nfor his heart had not the indifference of lucy\\'s, nor\\ncould his conscience have quite the ease of elinor\\'s.\\n\\nlucy, with a demure and settled air, seemed determined\\nto make no contribution to the comfort of the others,\\nand would not say a word; and almost every thing that was\\nsaid, proceeded from elinor, who was obliged to volunteer\\nall the information about her mother\\'s health, their coming\\nto town, &c. which edward ought to have inquired about,\\nbut never did.\\n\\nher exertions did not stop here; for she soon\\nafterwards felt herself so heroically disposed as\\nto determine, under pretence of fetching marianne,\\nto leave the others by themselves; and she really did it,\\nand that in the handsomest manner, for she loitered away\\nseveral minutes on the landing-place, with the most\\nhigh-minded fortitude, before she went to her sister.\\nwhen that was once done, however, it was time for the raptures\\nof edward to cease; for marianne\\'s joy hurried her into\\nthe drawing-room immediately.  her pleasure in seeing him\\nwas like every other of her feelings, strong in itself,\\nand strongly spoken.  she met him with a hand that would\\nbe taken, and a voice that expressed the affection of a sister.\\n\\n\"dear edward!\" she cried, \"this is a moment of great\\nhappiness!--this would almost make amends for every thing?\"\\n\\nedward tried to return her kindness as it deserved,\\nbut before such witnesses he dared not say half what he\\nreally felt.  again they all sat down, and for a moment\\nor two all were silent; while marianne was looking with the\\nmost speaking tenderness, sometimes at edward and sometimes\\nat elinor, regretting only that their delight in each\\nother should be checked by lucy\\'s unwelcome presence.\\nedward was the first to speak, and it was to notice\\nmarianne\\'s altered looks, and express his fear of her\\nnot finding london agree with her.\\n\\n\"oh, don\\'t think of me!\" she replied with spirited\\nearnestness, though her eyes were filled with tears\\nas she spoke, \"don\\'t think of my health.  elinor is well,\\nyou see.  that must be enough for us both.\"\\n\\nthis remark was not calculated to make edward or\\nelinor more easy, nor to conciliate the good will of lucy,\\nwho looked up at marianne with no very benignant expression.\\n\\n\"do you like london?\" said edward, willing to say\\nany thing that might introduce another subject.\\n\\n\"not at all.  i expected much pleasure in it,\\nbut i have found none.  the sight of you, edward, is the\\nonly comfort it has afforded; and thank heaven! you\\nare what you always were!\"\\n\\nshe paused--no one spoke.\\n\\n\"i think, elinor,\" she presently added, \"we must\\nemploy edward to take care of us in our return to barton.\\nin a week or two, i suppose, we shall be going; and, i trust,\\nedward will not be very unwilling to accept the charge.\"\\n\\npoor edward muttered something, but what it was,\\nnobody knew, not even himself.  but marianne, who saw\\nhis agitation, and could easily trace it to whatever\\ncause best pleased herself, was perfectly satisfied,\\nand soon talked of something else.\\n\\n\"we spent such a day, edward, in harley street\\nyesterday!  so dull, so wretchedly dull!--but i have much\\nto say to you on that head, which cannot be said now.\"\\n\\nand with this admirable discretion did she defer\\nthe assurance of her finding their mutual relatives more\\ndisagreeable than ever, and of her being particularly\\ndisgusted with his mother, till they were more in private.\\n\\n\"but why were you not there, edward?--why did you\\nnot come?\"\\n\\n\"i was engaged elsewhere.\"\\n\\n\"engaged!  but what was that, when such friends\\nwere to be met?\"\\n\\n\"perhaps, miss marianne,\" cried lucy, eager to take\\nsome revenge on her, \"you think young men never stand\\nupon engagements, if they have no mind to keep them,\\nlittle as well as great.\"\\n\\nelinor was very angry, but marianne seemed entirely\\ninsensible of the sting; for she calmly replied,\\n\\n\"not so, indeed; for, seriously speaking, i am very\\nsure that conscience only kept edward from harley street.\\nand i really believe he has the most delicate conscience\\nin the world; the most scrupulous in performing\\nevery engagement, however minute, and however it\\nmay make against his interest or pleasure.  he is the\\nmost fearful of giving pain, of wounding expectation,\\nand the most incapable of being selfish, of any body\\ni ever saw.  edward, it is so, and i will say it.\\nwhat! are you never to hear yourself praised!--then you\\nmust be no friend of mine; for those who will accept\\nof my love and esteem, must submit to my open commendation.\"\\n\\nthe nature of her commendation, in the present case,\\nhowever, happened to be particularly ill-suited to the\\nfeelings of two thirds of her auditors, and was so very\\nunexhilarating to edward, that he very soon got up to go away.\\n\\n\"going so soon!\" said marianne; \"my dear edward,\\nthis must not be.\"\\n\\nand drawing him a little aside, she whispered\\nher persuasion that lucy could not stay much longer.\\nbut even this encouragement failed, for he would go;\\nand lucy, who would have outstaid him, had his visit lasted\\ntwo hours, soon afterwards went away.\\n\\n\"what can bring her here so often?\" said marianne,\\non her leaving them.  \"could not she see that we wanted\\nher gone!--how teazing to edward!\"\\n\\n\"why so?--we were all his friends, and lucy has been\\nthe longest known to him of any.  it is but natural\\nthat he should like to see her as well as ourselves.\"\\n\\nmarianne looked at her steadily, and said, \"you know,\\nelinor, that this is a kind of talking which i cannot bear.\\nif you only hope to have your assertion contradicted,\\nas i must suppose to be the case, you ought to recollect\\nthat i am the last person in the world to do it.\\ni cannot descend to be tricked out of assurances, that are\\nnot really wanted.\"\\n\\nshe then left the room; and elinor dared not follow\\nher to say more, for bound as she was by her promise\\nof secrecy to lucy, she could give no information that\\nwould convince marianne; and painful as the consequences\\nof her still continuing in an error might be, she was\\nobliged to submit to it.  all that she could hope, was\\nthat edward would not often expose her or himself to the\\ndistress of hearing marianne\\'s mistaken warmth, nor to the\\nrepetition of any other part of the pain that had attended\\ntheir recent meeting--and this she had every reason to expect.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 36\\n\\n\\nwithin a few days after this meeting, the newspapers\\nannounced to the world, that the lady of thomas palmer,\\nesq. was safely delivered of a son and heir; a very\\ninteresting and satisfactory paragraph, at least to all\\nthose intimate connections who knew it before.\\n\\nthis event, highly important to mrs. jennings\\'s happiness,\\nproduced a temporary alteration in the disposal of her time,\\nand influenced, in a like degree, the engagements\\nof her young friends; for as she wished to be as much\\nas possible with charlotte, she went thither every morning\\nas soon as she was dressed, and did not return till late\\nin the evening; and the miss dashwoods, at the particular\\nrequest of the middletons, spent the whole of every day,\\nin every day in conduit street.  for their own comfort\\nthey would much rather have remained, at least all\\nthe morning, in mrs. jennings\\'s house; but it was not\\na thing to be urged against the wishes of everybody.\\ntheir hours were therefore made over to lady middleton\\nand the two miss steeles, by whom their company, in fact\\nwas as little valued, as it was professedly sought.\\n\\nthey had too much sense to be desirable companions\\nto the former; and by the latter they were considered with\\na jealous eye, as intruding on their ground, and sharing\\nthe kindness which they wanted to monopolize.  though nothing\\ncould be more polite than lady middleton\\'s behaviour to\\nelinor and marianne, she did not really like them at all.\\nbecause they neither flattered herself nor her children,\\nshe could not believe them good-natured; and because they\\nwere fond of reading, she fancied them satirical: perhaps\\nwithout exactly knowing what it was to be satirical;\\nbut that did not signify.  it was censure in common use,\\nand easily given.\\n\\ntheir presence was a restraint both on her and on lucy.\\nit checked the idleness of one, and the business of the other.\\nlady middleton was ashamed of doing nothing before them,\\nand the flattery which lucy was proud to think of\\nand administer at other times, she feared they would despise\\nher for offering.  miss steele was the least discomposed\\nof the three, by their presence; and it was in their power\\nto reconcile her to it entirely.  would either of them\\nonly have given her a full and minute account of the whole\\naffair between marianne and mr. willoughby, she would\\nhave thought herself amply rewarded for the sacrifice\\nof the best place by the fire after dinner, which their\\narrival occasioned.  but this conciliation was not granted;\\nfor though she often threw out expressions of pity for her\\nsister to elinor, and more than once dropt a reflection\\non the inconstancy of beaux before marianne, no effect\\nwas produced, but a look of indifference from the former,\\nor of disgust in the latter.  an effort even yet lighter\\nmight have made her their friend.  would they only have\\nlaughed at her about the doctor!  but so little were they,\\nanymore than the others, inclined to oblige her,\\nthat if sir john dined from home, she might spend a whole\\nday without hearing any other raillery on the subject,\\nthan what she was kind enough to bestow on herself.\\n\\nall these jealousies and discontents, however, were so\\ntotally unsuspected by mrs. jennings, that she thought\\nit a delightful thing for the girls to be together;\\nand generally congratulated her young friends every night,\\non having escaped the company of a stupid old woman so long.\\nshe joined them sometimes at sir john\\'s, sometimes\\nat her own house; but wherever it was, she always came\\nin excellent spirits, full of delight and importance,\\nattributing charlotte\\'s well doing to her own care, and ready\\nto give so exact, so minute a detail of her situation,\\nas only miss steele had curiosity enough to desire.\\none thing did disturb her; and of that she made her\\ndaily complaint.  mr. palmer maintained the common,\\nbut unfatherly opinion among his sex, of all infants being alike;\\nand though she could plainly perceive, at different times,\\nthe most striking resemblance between this baby and every\\none of his relations on both sides, there was no convincing\\nhis father of it; no persuading him to believe that it\\nwas not exactly like every other baby of the same age;\\nnor could he even be brought to acknowledge the simple\\nproposition of its being the finest child in the world.\\n\\ni come now to the relation of a misfortune,\\nwhich about this time befell mrs. john dashwood.\\nit so happened that while her two sisters with\\nmrs. jennings were first calling on her in harley street,\\nanother of her acquaintance had dropt in--a circumstance\\nin itself not apparently likely to produce evil to her.\\nbut while the imaginations of other people will carry\\nthem away to form wrong judgments of our conduct,\\nand to decide on it by slight appearances, one\\'s happiness\\nmust in some measure be always at the mercy of chance.\\nin the present instance, this last-arrived lady allowed\\nher fancy to so far outrun truth and probability,\\nthat on merely hearing the name of the miss dashwoods,\\nand understanding them to be mr. dashwood\\'s sisters,\\nshe immediately concluded them to be staying in harley street;\\nand this misconstruction produced within a day\\nor two afterwards, cards of invitation for them\\nas well as for their brother and sister, to a small\\nmusical party at her house.  the consequence of which was,\\nthat mrs. john dashwood was obliged to submit not only\\nto the exceedingly great inconvenience of sending her\\ncarriage for the miss dashwoods, but, what was still worse,\\nmust be subject to all the unpleasantness of appearing\\nto treat them with attention: and who could tell that they\\nmight not expect to go out with her a second time?  the power\\nof disappointing them, it was true, must always be her\\'s.\\nbut that was not enough; for when people are determined\\non a mode of conduct which they know to be wrong, they feel\\ninjured by the expectation of any thing better from them.\\n\\nmarianne had now been brought by degrees, so much\\ninto the habit of going out every day, that it was become\\na matter of indifference to her, whether she went or not:\\nand she prepared quietly and mechanically for every\\nevening\\'s engagement, though without expecting the smallest\\namusement from any, and very often without knowing,\\ntill the last moment, where it was to take her.\\n\\nto her dress and appearance she was grown so perfectly\\nindifferent, as not to bestow half the consideration on it,\\nduring the whole of her toilet, which it received from\\nmiss steele in the first five minutes of their being\\ntogether, when it was finished.  nothing escaped her minute\\nobservation and general curiosity; she saw every thing,\\nand asked every thing; was never easy till she knew the price\\nof every part of marianne\\'s dress; could have guessed the\\nnumber of her gowns altogether with better judgment than\\nmarianne herself, and was not without hopes of finding out\\nbefore they parted, how much her washing cost per week,\\nand how much she had every year to spend upon herself.\\nthe impertinence of these kind of scrutinies, moreover,\\nwas generally concluded with a compliment, which\\nthough meant as its douceur, was considered by marianne\\nas the greatest impertinence of all; for after undergoing\\nan examination into the value and make of her gown,\\nthe colour of her shoes, and the arrangement of her hair,\\nshe was almost sure of being told that upon \"her word\\nshe looked vastly smart, and she dared to say she would\\nmake a great many conquests.\"\\n\\nwith such encouragement as this, was she dismissed\\non the present occasion, to her brother\\'s carriage;\\nwhich they were ready to enter five minutes after it\\nstopped at the door, a punctuality not very agreeable\\nto their sister-in-law, who had preceded them to the house\\nof her acquaintance, and was there hoping for some delay\\non their part that might inconvenience either herself\\nor her coachman.\\n\\nthe events of this evening were not very remarkable.\\nthe party, like other musical parties, comprehended a\\ngreat many people who had real taste for the performance,\\nand a great many more who had none at all; and the performers\\nthemselves were, as usual, in their own estimation,\\nand that of their immediate friends, the first private\\nperformers in england.\\n\\nas elinor was neither musical, nor affecting to be so,\\nshe made no scruple of turning her eyes from the grand\\npianoforte, whenever it suited her, and unrestrained even\\nby the presence of a harp, and violoncello, would fix\\nthem at pleasure on any other object in the room.  in one\\nof these excursive glances she perceived among a group\\nof young men, the very he, who had given them a lecture\\non toothpick-cases at gray\\'s.  she perceived him soon\\nafterwards looking at herself, and speaking familiarly\\nto her brother; and had just determined to find out his\\nname from the latter, when they both came towards her,\\nand mr. dashwood introduced him to her as mr. robert ferrars.\\n\\nhe addressed her with easy civility, and twisted\\nhis head into a bow which assured her as plainly as\\nwords could have done, that he was exactly the coxcomb\\nshe had heard him described to be by lucy.  happy had\\nit been for her, if her regard for edward had depended\\nless on his own merit, than on the merit of his nearest\\nrelations!  for then his brother\\'s bow must have given\\nthe finishing stroke to what the ill-humour of his mother\\nand sister would have begun.  but while she wondered\\nat the difference of the two young men, she did not find\\nthat the emptiness of conceit of the one, put her out\\nof all charity with the modesty and worth of the other.\\nwhy they were different, robert exclaimed to her himself\\nin the course of a quarter of an hour\\'s conversation;\\nfor, talking of his brother, and lamenting the extreme\\ngaucherie which he really believed kept him from mixing\\nin proper society, he candidly and generously attributed it\\nmuch less to any natural deficiency, than to the misfortune\\nof a private education; while he himself, though probably\\nwithout any particular, any material superiority\\nby nature, merely from the advantage of a public school,\\nwas as well fitted to mix in the world as any other man.\\n\\n\"upon my soul,\" he added, \"i believe it is nothing more;\\nand so i often tell my mother, when she is grieving\\nabout it.  \\'my dear madam,\\' i always say to her, \\'you must\\nmake yourself easy.  the evil is now irremediable,\\nand it has been entirely your own doing.  why would\\nyou be persuaded by my uncle, sir robert, against your\\nown judgment, to place edward under private tuition,\\nat the most critical time of his life?  if you had only sent\\nhim to westminster as well as myself, instead of sending\\nhim to mr. pratt\\'s, all this would have been prevented.\\'\\nthis is the way in which i always consider the matter,\\nand my mother is perfectly convinced of her error.\"\\n\\nelinor would not oppose his opinion, because,\\nwhatever might be her general estimation of the advantage\\nof a public school, she could not think of edward\\'s\\nabode in mr. pratt\\'s family, with any satisfaction.\\n\\n\"you reside in devonshire, i think,\"--was his\\nnext observation, \"in a cottage near dawlish.\"\\n\\nelinor set him right as to its situation;\\nand it seemed rather surprising to him that anybody\\ncould live in devonshire, without living near dawlish.\\nhe bestowed his hearty approbation however on their\\nspecies of house.\\n\\n\"for my own part,\" said he, \"i am excessively fond\\nof a cottage; there is always so much comfort, so much\\nelegance about them.  and i protest, if i had any money\\nto spare, i should buy a little land and build one myself,\\nwithin a short distance of london, where i might drive\\nmyself down at any time, and collect a few friends\\nabout me, and be happy.  i advise every body who is going\\nto build, to build a cottage.  my friend lord courtland\\ncame to me the other day on purpose to ask my advice,\\nand laid before me three different plans of bonomi\\'s.\\ni was to decide on the best of them.  \\'my dear courtland,\\'\\nsaid i, immediately throwing them all into the fire, \\'do not\\nadopt either of them, but by all means build a cottage.\\'\\nand that i fancy, will be the end of it.\\n\\n\"some people imagine that there can be no accommodations,\\nno space in a cottage; but this is all a mistake.\\ni was last month at my friend elliott\\'s, near dartford.\\nlady elliott wished to give a dance.  \\'but how can it\\nbe done?\\' said she; \\'my dear ferrars, do tell me how it\\nis to be managed.  there is not a room in this cottage\\nthat will hold ten couple, and where can the supper be?\\'\\ni immediately saw that there could be no difficulty in it,\\nso i said, \\'my dear lady elliott, do not be uneasy.\\nthe dining parlour will admit eighteen couple with ease;\\ncard-tables may be placed in the drawing-room; the library\\nmay be open for tea and other refreshments; and let the\\nsupper be set out in the saloon.\\'  lady elliott was delighted\\nwith the thought.  we measured the dining-room, and found\\nit would hold exactly eighteen couple, and the affair\\nwas arranged precisely after my plan.  so that, in fact,\\nyou see, if people do but know how to set about it,\\nevery comfort may be as well enjoyed in a cottage\\nas in the most spacious dwelling.\"\\n\\nelinor agreed to it all, for she did not think\\nhe deserved the compliment of rational opposition.\\n\\nas john dashwood had no more pleasure in music than his\\neldest sister, his mind was equally at liberty to fix on\\nany thing else; and a thought struck him during the evening,\\nwhich he communicated to his wife, for her approbation,\\nwhen they got home.  the consideration of mrs. dennison\\'s\\nmistake,\\nin supposing his sisters their guests, had suggested the\\npropriety of their being really invited to become such,\\nwhile mrs. jenning\\'s engagements kept her from home.\\nthe expense would be nothing, the inconvenience not more;\\nand it was altogether an attention which the delicacy\\nof his conscience pointed out to be requisite to its\\ncomplete enfranchisement from his promise to his father.\\nfanny was startled at the proposal.\\n\\n\"i do not see how it can be done,\" said she,\\n\"without affronting lady middleton, for they spend every day\\nwith her; otherwise i should be exceedingly glad to do it.\\nyou know i am always ready to pay them any attention\\nin my power, as my taking them out this evening shews.\\nbut they are lady middleton\\'s visitors.  how can i ask them\\naway from her?\"\\n\\nher husband, but with great humility, did not see\\nthe force of her objection.  \"they had already spent a week\\nin this manner in conduit street, and lady middleton\\ncould not be displeased at their giving the same number\\nof days to such near relations.\"\\n\\nfanny paused a moment, and then, with fresh vigor, said,\\n\\n\"my love i would ask them with all my heart, if it\\nwas in my power.  but i had just settled within myself\\nto ask the miss steeles to spend a few days with us.\\nthey are very well behaved, good kind of girls; and i think\\nthe attention is due to them, as their uncle did so very\\nwell by edward.  we can ask your sisters some other year,\\nyou know; but the miss steeles may not be in town any more.\\ni am sure you will like them; indeed, you do like them,\\nyou know, very much already, and so does my mother; and they\\nare such favourites with harry!\"\\n\\nmr. dashwood was convinced.  he saw the necessity\\nof inviting the miss steeles immediately, and his conscience\\nwas pacified by the resolution of inviting his sisters\\nanother year; at the same time, however, slyly suspecting\\nthat another year would make the invitation needless,\\nby bringing elinor to town as colonel brandon\\'s wife,\\nand marianne as their visitor.\\n\\nfanny, rejoicing in her escape, and proud of the ready\\nwit that had procured it, wrote the next morning to lucy,\\nto request her company and her sister\\'s, for some days,\\nin harley street, as soon as lady middleton could spare them.\\nthis was enough to make lucy really and reasonably happy.\\nmrs. dashwood seemed actually working for her, herself;\\ncherishing all her hopes, and promoting all her views!\\nsuch an opportunity of being with edward and his family was,\\nabove all things, the most material to her interest,\\nand such an invitation the most gratifying to her\\nfeelings!  it was an advantage that could not be too\\ngratefully acknowledged, nor too speedily made use of;\\nand the visit to lady middleton, which had not before had\\nany precise limits, was instantly discovered to have been\\nalways meant to end in two days\\' time.\\n\\nwhen the note was shown to elinor, as it was within ten\\nminutes after its arrival, it gave her, for the first time,\\nsome share in the expectations of lucy; for such a mark\\nof uncommon kindness, vouchsafed on so short an acquaintance,\\nseemed to declare that the good-will towards her arose\\nfrom something more than merely malice against herself;\\nand might be brought, by time and address, to do\\nevery thing that lucy wished.  her flattery had already\\nsubdued the pride of lady middleton, and made an entry\\ninto the close heart of mrs. john dashwood; and these\\nwere effects that laid open the probability of greater.\\n\\nthe miss steeles removed to harley street, and all\\nthat reached elinor of their influence there, strengthened\\nher expectation of the event.  sir john, who called on\\nthem more than once, brought home such accounts of the\\nfavour they were in, as must be universally striking.\\nmrs. dashwood had never been so much pleased with any\\nyoung women in her life, as she was with them; had given\\neach of them a needle book made by some emigrant;\\ncalled lucy by her christian name; and did not know\\nwhether she should ever be able to part with them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[at this point in the first and second edtions, volume ii ended.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 37\\n\\n\\nmrs. palmer was so well at the end of a fortnight,\\nthat her mother felt it no longer necessary to give up\\nthe whole of her time to her; and, contenting herself with\\nvisiting her once or twice a day, returned from that period\\nto her own home, and her own habits, in which she found\\nthe miss dashwoods very ready to resume their former share.\\n\\nabout the third or fourth morning after their\\nbeing thus resettled in berkeley street, mrs. jennings,\\non returning from her ordinary visit to mrs. palmer,\\nentered the drawing-room, where elinor was sitting\\nby herself, with an air of such hurrying importance\\nas prepared her to hear something wonderful; and giving her\\ntime only to form that idea, began directly to justify it,\\nby saying,\\n\\n\"lord! my dear miss dashwood! have you heard the news?\"\\n\\n\"no, ma\\'am.  what is it?\"\\n\\n\"something so strange!  but you shall hear it all.--\\nwhen i got to mr. palmer\\'s, i found charlotte quite\\nin a fuss about the child.  she was sure it was very\\nill--it cried, and fretted, and was all over pimples.\\nso i looked at it directly, and, \\'lord! my dear,\\'\\nsays i, \\'it is nothing in the world, but the red gum--\\'\\nand nurse said just the same.  but charlotte, she would\\nnot be satisfied, so mr. donavan was sent for; and luckily\\nhe happened to just come in from harley street, so he\\nstepped over directly, and as soon as ever he saw the child,\\nbe said just as we did, that it was nothing in the world\\nbut the red gum, and then charlotte was easy.  and so,\\njust as he was going away again, it came into my head,\\ni am sure i do not know how i happened to think of it,\\nbut it came into my head to ask him if there was any news.\\nso upon that, he smirked, and simpered, and looked grave,\\nand seemed to know something or other, and at last he\\nsaid in a whisper, \\'for fear any unpleasant report\\nshould reach the young ladies under your care as to their\\nsister\\'s indisposition, i think it advisable to say,\\nthat i believe there is no great reason for alarm; i hope\\nmrs. dashwood will do very well.\\'\"\\n\\n\"what! is fanny ill?\"\\n\\n\"that is exactly what i said, my dear.  \\'lord!\\' says i,\\n\\'is mrs. dashwood ill?\\' so then it all came out; and the\\nlong and the short of the matter, by all i can learn,\\nseems to be this.  mr. edward ferrars, the very young\\nman i used to joke with you about (but however, as it\\nturns out, i am monstrous glad there was never any thing\\nin it), mr. edward ferrars, it seems, has been engaged\\nabove this twelvemonth to my cousin lucy!--there\\'s for you,\\nmy dear!--and not a creature knowing a syllable of the matter,\\nexcept nancy!--could you have believed such a thing possible?--\\nthere is no great wonder in their liking one another;\\nbut that matters should be brought so forward between them,\\nand nobody suspect it!--that is strange!--i never happened\\nto see them together, or i am sure i should have found it\\nout directly.  well, and so this was kept a great secret,\\nfor fear of mrs. ferrars, and neither she nor your\\nbrother or sister suspected a word of the matter;--\\ntill this very morning, poor nancy, who, you know, is a\\nwell-meaning creature, but no conjurer, popt it all out.\\n\\'lord!\\' thinks she to herself, \\'they are all so fond\\nof lucy, to be sure they will make no difficulty about it;\\'\\nand so, away she went to your sister, who was sitting all\\nalone at her carpet-work, little suspecting what was to\\ncome--for she had just been saying to your brother, only five\\nminutes before, that she thought to make a match between\\nedward and some lord\\'s daughter or other, i forget who.\\nso you may think what a blow it was to all her vanity\\nand pride.  she fell into violent hysterics immediately,\\nwith such screams as reached your brother\\'s ears,\\nas he was sitting in his own dressing-room down stairs,\\nthinking about writing a letter to his steward in the country.\\nso up he flew directly, and a terrible scene took place,\\nfor lucy was come to them by that time, little dreaming\\nwhat was going on.  poor soul!  i pity her.  and i must say,\\ni think she was used very hardly; for your sister scolded\\nlike any fury, and soon drove her into a fainting fit.\\nnancy, she fell upon her knees, and cried bitterly;\\nand your brother, he walked about the room, and said\\nhe did not know what to do.  mrs. dashwood declared\\nthey should not stay a minute longer in the house,\\nand your brother was forced to go down upon his knees too,\\nto persuade her to let them stay till they had packed\\nup their clothes.  then she fell into hysterics again,\\nand he was so frightened that he would send for mr. donavan,\\nand mr. donavan found the house in all this uproar.\\nthe carriage was at the door ready to take my poor\\ncousins away, and they were just stepping in as he\\ncame off; poor lucy in such a condition, he says,\\nshe could hardly walk; and nancy, she was almost as bad.\\ni declare, i have no patience with your sister; and i hope,\\nwith all my heart, it will be a match in spite of her.\\nlord! what a taking poor mr. edward will be in when he\\nhears of it!  to have his love used so scornfully! for\\nthey say he is monstrous fond of her, as well he may.\\ni should not wonder, if he was to be in the greatest\\npassion!--and mr. donavan thinks just the same.  he and i\\nhad a great deal of talk about it; and the best of all is,\\nthat he is gone back again to harley street, that he may\\nbe within call when mrs. ferrars is told of it, for she\\nwas sent for as soon as ever my cousins left the house,\\nfor your sister was sure she would be in hysterics too;\\nand so she may, for what i care.  i have no pity for\\neither of them.  i have no notion of people\\'s making\\nsuch a to-do about money and greatness.  there is no\\nreason on earth why mr. edward and lucy should not marry;\\nfor i am sure mrs. ferrars may afford to do very well\\nby her son, and though lucy has next to nothing herself,\\nshe knows better than any body how to make the most\\nof every thing; i dare say, if mrs. ferrars would only\\nallow him five hundred a-year, she would make as good\\nan appearance with it as any body else would with eight.\\nlord! how snug they might live in such another cottage\\nas yours--or a little bigger--with two maids, and two men;\\nand i believe i could help them to a housemaid, for my\\nbetty has a sister out of place, that would fit them\\nexactly.\"\\n\\nhere mrs. jennings ceased, and as elinor had had\\ntime enough to collect her thoughts, she was able\\nto give such an answer, and make such observations,\\nas the subject might naturally be supposed to produce.\\nhappy to find that she was not suspected of any extraordinary\\ninterest in it; that mrs. jennings (as she had of late\\noften hoped might be the case) had ceased to imagine her\\nat all attached to edward; and happy above all the rest,\\nin the absence of marianne, she felt very well able\\nto speak of the affair without embarrassment, and to\\ngive her judgment, as she believed, with impartiality\\non the conduct of every one concerned in it.\\n\\nshe could hardly determine what her own expectation\\nof its event really was; though she earnestly tried\\nto drive away the notion of its being possible to end\\notherwise at last, than in the marriage of edward and lucy.\\nwhat mrs. ferrars would say and do, though there could\\nnot be a doubt of its nature, she was anxious to hear;\\nand still more anxious to know how edward would\\nconduct himself.  for him she felt much compassion;--\\nfor lucy very little--and it cost her some pains to procure\\nthat little;--for the rest of the party none at all.\\n\\nas mrs. jennings could talk on no other subject,\\nelinor soon saw the necessity of preparing marianne for\\nits discussion.  no time was to be lost in undeceiving her,\\nin making her acquainted with the real truth, and in\\nendeavouring to bring her to hear it talked of by others,\\nwithout betraying that she felt any uneasiness for her sister,\\nor any resentment against edward.\\n\\nelinor\\'s office was a painful one.--she was going\\nto remove what she really believed to be her sister\\'s\\nchief consolation,--to give such particulars of edward as she\\nfeared would ruin him for ever in her good opinion,-and\\nto make marianne, by a resemblance in their situations,\\nwhich to her fancy would seem strong, feel all her own\\ndisappointment over again.  but unwelcome as such a task\\nmust be, it was necessary to be done, and elinor therefore\\nhastened to perform it.\\n\\nshe was very far from wishing to dwell on her own\\nfeelings, or to represent herself as suffering much,\\nany otherwise than as the self-command she had practised\\nsince her first knowledge of edward\\'s engagement, might\\nsuggest a hint of what was practicable to marianne.\\nher narration was clear and simple; and though it could\\nnot be given without emotion, it was not accompanied\\nby violent agitation, nor impetuous grief.--that belonged\\nrather to the hearer, for marianne listened with horror,\\nand cried excessively.  elinor was to be the comforter\\nof others in her own distresses, no less than in theirs;\\nand all the comfort that could be given by assurances\\nof her own composure of mind, and a very earnest\\nvindication of edward from every charge but of imprudence,\\nwas readily offered.\\n\\nbut marianne for some time would give credit to neither.\\nedward seemed a second willoughby; and acknowledging\\nas elinor did, that she had loved him most sincerely,\\ncould she feel less than herself!  as for lucy steele,\\nshe considered her so totally unamiable, so absolutely\\nincapable of attaching a sensible man, that she could\\nnot be persuaded at first to believe, and afterwards\\nto pardon, any former affection of edward for her.\\nshe would not even admit it to have been natural;\\nand elinor left her to be convinced that it was so,\\nby that which only could convince her, a better knowledge\\nof mankind.\\n\\nher first communication had reached no farther than\\nto state the fact of the engagement, and the length of time\\nit had existed.--marianne\\'s feelings had then broken in,\\nand put an end to all regularity of detail; and for some\\ntime all that could be done was to soothe her distress,\\nlessen her alarms, and combat her resentment.  the first\\nquestion on her side, which led to farther particulars,\\nwas,\\n\\n\"how long has this been known to you, elinor? has\\nhe written to you?\"\\n\\n\"i have known it these four months.  when lucy\\nfirst came to barton park last november, she told me\\nin confidence of her engagement.\"\\n\\nat these words, marianne\\'s eyes expressed the astonishment\\nwhich her lips could not utter.  after a pause of wonder,\\nshe exclaimed--\\n\\n\"four months!--have you known of this four months?\"\\n\\nelinor confirmed it.\\n\\n\"what!--while attending me in all my misery, has this\\nbeen on your heart?--and i have reproached you for being\\nhappy!\"--\\n\\n\"it was not fit that you should then know how much\\ni was the reverse!\"\\n\\n\"four months!\"--cried marianne again.--\"so calm!--\\nso cheerful!--how have you been supported?\"--\\n\\n\"by feeling that i was doing my duty.--my promise to\\nlucy, obliged me to be secret.  i owed it to her, therefore,\\nto avoid giving any hint of the truth; and i owed it to my\\nfamily and friends, not to create in them a solicitude about me,\\nwhich it could not be in my power to satisfy.\"\\n\\nmarianne seemed much struck.\\n\\n\"i have very often wished to undeceive yourself and my\\nmother,\" added elinor; \"and once or twice i have attempted it;--\\nbut without betraying my trust, i never could have convinced\\nyou.\"\\n\\n\"four months!--and yet you loved him!\"--\\n\\n\"yes. but i did not love only him;--and while the comfort\\nof others was dear to me, i was glad to spare them from knowing\\nhow much i felt.  now, i can think and speak of it with\\nlittle emotion.  i would not have you suffer on my account;\\nfor i assure you i no longer suffer materially myself.\\ni have many things to support me.  i am not conscious of having\\nprovoked the disappointment by any imprudence of my own,\\ni have borne it as much as possible without spreading\\nit farther.  i acquit edward of essential misconduct.\\ni wish him very happy; and i am so sure of his always\\ndoing his duty, that though now he may harbour some regret,\\nin the end he must become so.  lucy does not want sense,\\nand that is the foundation on which every thing good may\\nbe built.--and after all, marianne, after all that is\\nbewitching in the idea of a single and constant attachment,\\nand all that can be said of one\\'s happiness depending\\nentirely on any particular person, it is not meant--it\\nis not fit--it is not possible that it should be so.--\\nedward will marry lucy; he will marry a woman superior\\nin person and understanding to half her sex; and time\\nand habit will teach him to forget that he ever thought\\nanother superior to her.\"--\\n\\n\"if such is your way of thinking,\" said marianne,\\n\"if the loss of what is most valued is so easily\\nto be made up by something else, your resolution,\\nyour self-command, are, perhaps, a little less to be\\nwondered at.--they are brought more within my comprehension.\"\\n\\n\"i understand you.--you do not suppose that i have ever\\nfelt much.--for four months, marianne, i have had all this\\nhanging on my mind, without being at liberty to speak\\nof it to a single creature; knowing that it would make\\nyou and my mother most unhappy whenever it were explained\\nto you, yet unable to prepare you for it in the least.--\\nit was told me,--it was in a manner forced on me by the\\nvery person herself, whose prior engagement ruined all\\nmy prospects; and told me, as i thought, with triumph.--\\nthis person\\'s suspicions, therefore, i have had to oppose,\\nby endeavouring to appear indifferent where i have been most\\ndeeply interested;--and it has not been only once;--i have\\nhad her hopes and exultation to listen to again and again.--\\ni have known myself to be divided from edward for ever,\\nwithout hearing one circumstance that could make me less\\ndesire the connection.--nothing has proved him unworthy;\\nnor has anything declared him indifferent to me.--\\ni have had to contend against the unkindness of his sister,\\nand the insolence of his mother; and have suffered the\\npunishment of an attachment, without enjoying its advantages.--\\nand all this has been going on at a time, when, as you\\nknow too well, it has not been my only unhappiness.--\\nif you can think me capable of ever feeling--surely you\\nmay suppose that i have suffered now.  the composure\\nof mind with which i have brought myself at present\\nto consider the matter, the consolation that i have been\\nwilling to admit, have been the effect of constant and\\npainful exertion;--they did not spring up of themselves;--\\nthey did not occur to relieve my spirits at first.--\\nno, marianne.--then, if i had not been bound to silence,\\nperhaps nothing could have kept me entirely--not even what i\\nowed to my dearest friends--from openly shewing that i was\\nvery unhappy.\"--\\n\\nmarianne was quite subdued.--\\n\\n\"oh! elinor,\" she cried, \"you have made me hate\\nmyself for ever.--how barbarous have i been to you!--\\nyou, who have been my only comfort, who have borne with me\\nin all my misery, who have seemed to be only suffering\\nfor me!--is this my gratitude?--is this the only return i\\ncan make you?--because your merit cries out upon myself,\\ni have been trying to do it away.\"\\n\\nthe tenderest caresses followed this confession.\\nin such a frame of mind as she was now in, elinor had\\nno difficulty in obtaining from her whatever promise\\nshe required; and at her request, marianne engaged\\nnever to speak of the affair to any one with the least\\nappearance of bitterness;--to meet lucy without betraying\\nthe smallest increase of dislike to her;--and even to see\\nedward himself, if chance should bring them together,\\nwithout any diminution of her usual cordiality.--\\nthese were great concessions;--but where marianne felt\\nthat she had injured, no reparation could be too much\\nfor her to make.\\n\\nshe performed her promise of being discreet,\\nto admiration.--she attended to all that mrs. jennings\\nhad to say upon the subject, with an unchanging complexion,\\ndissented from her in nothing, and was heard three\\ntimes to say, \"yes, ma\\'am.\"--she listened to her praise\\nof lucy with only moving from one chair to another,\\nand when mrs. jennings talked of edward\\'s affection,\\nit cost her only a spasm in her throat.--such advances\\ntowards heroism in her sister, made elinor feel equal\\nto any thing herself.\\n\\nthe next morning brought a farther trial of it,\\nin a visit from their brother, who came with a most serious\\naspect to talk over the dreadful affair, and bring them\\nnews of his wife.\\n\\n\"you have heard, i suppose,\" said he with great solemnity,\\nas soon as he was seated, \"of the very shocking discovery\\nthat took place under our roof yesterday.\"\\n\\nthey all looked their assent; it seemed too awful\\na moment for speech.\\n\\n\"your sister,\" he continued, \"has suffered dreadfully.\\nmrs. ferrars too--in short it has been a scene of such\\ncomplicated distress--but i will hope that the storm may\\nbe weathered without our being any of us quite overcome.\\npoor fanny! she was in hysterics all yesterday.\\nbut i would not alarm you too much.  donavan says there\\nis nothing materially to be apprehended; her constitution\\nis a good one, and her resolution equal to any thing.\\nshe has borne it all, with the fortitude of an angel!\\nshe says she never shall think well of anybody again;\\nand one cannot wonder at it, after being so deceived!--\\nmeeting with such ingratitude, where so much kindness\\nhad been shewn, so much confidence had been placed!  it\\nwas quite out of the benevolence of her heart, that she\\nhad asked these young women to her house; merely because\\nshe thought they deserved some attention, were harmless,\\nwell-behaved girls, and would be pleasant companions;\\nfor otherwise we both wished very much to have invited you\\nand marianne to be with us, while your kind friend there,\\nwas attending her daughter.  and now to be so rewarded!\\n\\'i wish, with all my heart,\\' says poor fanny in her\\naffectionate way, \\'that we had asked your sisters instead\\nof them.\\'\"\\n\\nhere he stopped to be thanked; which being done,\\nhe went on.\\n\\n\"what poor mrs. ferrars suffered, when first fanny\\nbroke it to her, is not to be described.  while she with\\nthe truest affection had been planning a most eligible\\nconnection for him, was it to be supposed that he could\\nbe all the time secretly engaged to another person!--such\\na suspicion could never have entered her head!  if she\\nsuspected any prepossession elsewhere, it could not be\\nin that quarter.  \\'there, to be sure,\\' said she, \\'i might\\nhave thought myself safe.\\' she was quite in an agony.\\nwe consulted together, however, as to what should be done,\\nand at last she determined to send for edward.\\nhe came.  but i am sorry to relate what ensued.\\nall that mrs. ferrars could say to make him put an end\\nto the engagement, assisted too as you may well suppose\\nby my arguments, and fanny\\'s entreaties, was of\\nno avail.  duty, affection, every thing was disregarded.\\ni never thought edward so stubborn, so unfeeling before.\\nhis mother explained to him her liberal designs, in case\\nof his marrying miss morton; told him she would settle on\\nhim the norfolk estate, which, clear of land-tax, brings\\nin a good thousand a-year; offered even, when matters\\ngrew desperate, to make it twelve hundred; and in opposition\\nto this, if he still persisted in this low connection,\\nrepresented to him the certain penury that must attend\\nthe match.  his own two thousand pounds she protested\\nshould be his all; she would never see him again; and so far\\nwould she be from affording him the smallest assistance,\\nthat if he were to enter into any profession with a view\\nof better support, she would do all in her power to prevent\\nhim advancing in it.\"\\n\\nhere marianne, in an ecstasy of indignation,\\nclapped her hands together, and cried, \"gracious god!\\ncan this be possible!\"\\n\\n\"well may you wonder, marianne,\" replied her brother,\\n\"at the obstinacy which could resist such arguments as these.\\nyour exclamation is very natural.\"\\n\\nmarianne was going to retort, but she remembered\\nher promises, and forbore.\\n\\n\"all this, however,\" he continued, \"was urged in vain.\\nedward said very little; but what he did say, was in\\nthe most determined manner.  nothing should prevail on\\nhim to give up his engagement.  he would stand to it,\\ncost him what it might.\"\\n\\n\"then,\" cried mrs. jennings with blunt sincerity,\\nno longer able to be silent, \"he has acted like an honest\\nman! i beg your pardon, mr. dashwood, but if he had\\ndone otherwise, i should have thought him a rascal.\\ni have some little concern in the business, as well\\nas yourself, for lucy steele is my cousin, and i believe\\nthere is not a better kind of girl in the world, nor one\\nwho more deserves a good husband.\"\\n\\njohn dashwood was greatly astonished; but his nature\\nwas calm, not open to provocation, and he never wished\\nto offend anybody, especially anybody of good fortune.\\nhe therefore replied, without any resentment,\\n\\n\"i would by no means speak disrespectfully of any\\nrelation of yours, madam.  miss lucy steele is, i dare say,\\na very deserving young woman, but in the present case\\nyou know, the connection must be impossible.\\nand to have entered into a secret engagement with a\\nyoung man under her uncle\\'s care, the son of a woman\\nespecially of such very large fortune as mrs. ferrars,\\nis perhaps, altogether a little extraordinary. in short,\\ni do not mean to reflect upon the behaviour of any person\\nwhom you have a regard for, mrs. jennings.  we all wish\\nher extremely happy; and mrs. ferrars\\'s conduct throughout\\nthe whole, has been such as every conscientious, good mother,\\nin like circumstances, would adopt.  it has been dignified\\nand liberal.  edward has drawn his own lot, and i fear\\nit will be a bad one.\"\\n\\nmarianne sighed out her similar apprehension;\\nand elinor\\'s heart wrung for the feelings of edward,\\nwhile braving his mother\\'s threats, for a woman who could\\nnot reward him.\\n\\n\"well, sir,\" said mrs. jennings, \"and how did it end?\"\\n\\n\"i am sorry to say, ma\\'am, in a most unhappy rupture:--\\nedward is dismissed for ever from his mother\\'s notice.\\nhe left her house yesterday, but where he is gone, or whether\\nhe is still in town, i do not know; for we of course can\\nmake no inquiry.\"\\n\\n\"poor young man!--and what is to become of him?\"\\n\\n\"what, indeed, ma\\'am!  it is a melancholy consideration.\\nborn to the prospect of such affluence!  i cannot conceive\\na situation more deplorable.  the interest of two thousand\\npounds--how can a man live on it?--and when to that is added\\nthe recollection, that he might, but for his own folly,\\nwithin three months have been in the receipt of two\\nthousand, five hundred a-year (for miss morton has\\nthirty thousand pounds,) i cannot picture to myself\\na more wretched condition.  we must all feel for him;\\nand the more so, because it is totally out of our power\\nto assist him.\"\\n\\n\"poor young man!\" cried mrs. jennings, \"i am sure\\nhe should be very welcome to bed and board at my house;\\nand so i would tell him if i could see him.  it is not fit\\nthat he should be living about at his own charge now,\\nat lodgings and taverns.\"\\n\\nelinor\\'s heart thanked her for such kindness towards edward,\\nthough she could not forbear smiling at the form of it.\\n\\n\"if he would only have done as well by himself,\"\\nsaid john dashwood, \"as all his friends were disposed to do\\nby him, he might now have been in his proper situation,\\nand would have wanted for nothing.  but as it is, it must\\nbe out of anybody\\'s power to assist him.  and there is one\\nthing more preparing against him, which must be worse than\\nall--his mother has determined, with a very natural kind\\nof spirit, to settle that estate upon robert immediately,\\nwhich might have been edward\\'s, on proper conditions.\\ni left her this morning with her lawyer, talking over\\nthe business.\"\\n\\n\"well!\" said mrs. jennings, \"that is her revenge.\\neverybody has a way of their own.  but i don\\'t think mine\\nwould be, to make one son independent, because another had\\nplagued me.\"\\n\\nmarianne got up and walked about the room.\\n\\n\"can anything be more galling to the spirit of a man,\"\\ncontinued john, \"than to see his younger brother in\\npossession of an estate which might have been his own?\\npoor edward!  i feel for him sincerely.\"\\n\\na few minutes more spent in the same kind of effusion,\\nconcluded his visit; and with repeated assurances to his\\nsisters that he really believed there was no material\\ndanger in fanny\\'s indisposition, and that they need\\nnot therefore be very uneasy about it, he went away;\\nleaving the three ladies unanimous in their sentiments\\non the present occasion, as far at least as it regarded\\nmrs. ferrars\\'s conduct, the dashwoods\\', and edward\\'s.\\n\\nmarianne\\'s indignation burst forth as soon as he\\nquitted the room; and as her vehemence made reserve\\nimpossible in elinor, and unnecessary in mrs. jennings,\\nthey all joined in a very spirited critique upon the party.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 38\\n\\n\\nmrs. jennings was very warm in her praise of edward\\'s\\nconduct, but only elinor and marianne understood its\\ntrue merit.  they only knew how little he had had to tempt\\nhim to be disobedient, and how small was the consolation,\\nbeyond the consciousness of doing right, that could\\nremain to him in the loss of friends and fortune.\\nelinor gloried in his integrity; and marianne forgave all\\nhis offences in compassion for his punishment.  but though\\nconfidence between them was, by this public discovery,\\nrestored to its proper state, it was not a subject on\\nwhich either of them were fond of dwelling when alone.\\nelinor avoided it upon principle, as tending to fix still\\nmore upon her thoughts, by the too warm, too positive\\nassurances of marianne, that belief of edward\\'s continued\\naffection for herself which she rather wished to do away;\\nand marianne\\'s courage soon failed her, in trying\\nto converse upon a topic which always left her more\\ndissatisfied with herself than ever, by the comparison\\nit necessarily produced between elinor\\'s conduct and her own.\\n\\nshe felt all the force of that comparison; but not\\nas her sister had hoped, to urge her to exertion now;\\nshe felt it with all the pain of continual self-reproach,\\nregretted most bitterly that she had never exerted\\nherself before; but it brought only the torture of penitence,\\nwithout the hope of amendment.  her mind was so much weakened\\nthat she still fancied present exertion impossible,\\nand therefore it only dispirited her more.\\n\\nnothing new was heard by them, for a day or two afterwards,\\nof affairs in harley street, or bartlett\\'s buildings.\\nbut though so much of the matter was known to them already,\\nthat mrs. jennings might have had enough to do in spreading\\nthat knowledge farther, without seeking after more,\\nshe had resolved from the first to pay a visit of comfort\\nand inquiry to her cousins as soon as she could;\\nand nothing but the hindrance of more visitors than usual,\\nhad prevented her going to them within that time.\\n\\nthe third day succeeding their knowledge of the\\nparticulars, was so fine, so beautiful a sunday as to draw\\nmany to kensington gardens, though it was only the second\\nweek in march.  mrs. jennings and elinor were of the number;\\nbut marianne, who knew that the willoughbys were again\\nin town, and had a constant dread of meeting them,\\nchose rather to stay at home, than venture into so public\\na place.\\n\\nan intimate acquaintance of mrs. jennings joined\\nthem soon after they entered the gardens, and elinor was\\nnot sorry that by her continuing with them, and engaging\\nall mrs. jennings\\'s conversation, she was herself left\\nto quiet reflection.  she saw nothing of the willoughbys,\\nnothing of edward, and for some time nothing of anybody\\nwho could by any chance whether grave or gay, be interesting\\nto her.  but at last she found herself with some surprise,\\naccosted by miss steele, who, though looking rather shy,\\nexpressed great satisfaction in meeting them, and on receiving\\nencouragement from the particular kindness of mrs. jennings,\\nleft her own party for a short time, to join their\\'s.\\nmrs. jennings immediately whispered to elinor,\\n\\n\"get it all out of her, my dear.  she will tell you\\nany thing if you ask.  you see i cannot leave mrs. clarke.\"\\n\\nit was lucky, however, for mrs. jennings\\'s curiosity\\nand elinor\\'s too, that she would tell any thing without\\nbeing asked; for nothing would otherwise have been learnt.\\n\\n\"i am so glad to meet you;\" said miss steele,\\ntaking her familiarly by the arm--\"for i wanted to see you\\nof all things in the world.\"  and then lowering her voice,\\n\"i suppose mrs. jennings has heard all about it.\\nis she angry?\"\\n\\n\"not at all, i believe, with you.\"\\n\\n\"that is a good thing.  and lady middleton, is she angry?\"\\n\\n\"i cannot suppose it possible that she should.\"\\n\\n\"i am monstrous glad of it.  good gracious!  i have\\nhad such a time of it!  i never saw lucy in such a rage\\nin my life.  she vowed at first she would never trim me\\nup a new bonnet, nor do any thing else for me again,\\nso long as she lived; but now she is quite come to,\\nand we are as good friends as ever.  look, she made me\\nthis bow to my hat, and put in the feather last night.\\nthere now, you are going to laugh at me too.  but why\\nshould not i wear pink ribbons?  i do not care if it is\\nthe doctor\\'s favourite colour.  i am sure, for my part,\\ni should never have known he did like it better than\\nany other colour, if he had not happened to say so.\\nmy cousins have been so plaguing me!  i declare sometimes\\ni do not know which way to look before them.\"\\n\\nshe had wandered away to a subject on which elinor\\nhad nothing to say, and therefore soon judged it expedient\\nto find her way back again to the first.\\n\\n\"well, but miss dashwood,\" speaking triumphantly,\\n\"people may say what they chuse about mr. ferrars\\'s\\ndeclaring he would not have lucy, for it is no such thing\\ni can tell you; and it is quite a shame for such ill-natured\\nreports to be spread abroad.  whatever lucy might think\\nabout it herself, you know, it was no business of other\\npeople to set it down for certain.\"\\n\\n\"i never heard any thing of the kind hinted at before,\\ni assure you,\" said elinor.\\n\\n\"oh, did not you?  but it was said, i know, very well,\\nand by more than one; for miss godby told miss sparks,\\nthat nobody in their senses could expect mr. ferrars\\nto give up a woman like miss morton, with thirty thousand\\npounds to her fortune, for lucy steele that had\\nnothing at all; and i had it from miss sparks myself.\\nand besides that, my cousin richard said himself,\\nthat when it came to the point he was afraid mr. ferrars\\nwould be off; and when edward did not come near us\\nfor three days, i could not tell what to think myself;\\nand i believe in my heart lucy gave it up all for lost;\\nfor we came away from your brother\\'s wednesday,\\nand we saw nothing of him not all thursday, friday,\\nand saturday, and did not know what was become of him.\\nonce lucy thought to write to him, but then her spirits\\nrose against that.  however this morning he came just\\nas we came home from church; and then it all came out,\\nhow he had been sent for wednesday to harley street,\\nand been talked to by his mother and all of them,\\nand how he had declared before them all that he loved\\nnobody but lucy, and nobody but lucy would he have.\\nand how he had been so worried by what passed,\\nthat as soon as he had went away from his mother\\'s house,\\nhe had got upon his horse, and rid into the country,\\nsome where or other; and how he had stayed about at an inn\\nall thursday and friday, on purpose to get the better\\nof it.  and after thinking it all over and over again,\\nhe said, it seemed to him as if, now he had no fortune,\\nand no nothing at all, it would be quite unkind to keep\\nher on to the engagement, because it must be for her loss,\\nfor he had nothing but two thousand pounds, and no hope\\nof any thing else; and if he was to go into orders,\\nas he had some thoughts, he could get nothing but a curacy,\\nand how was they to live upon that?--he could not bear\\nto think of her doing no better, and so he begged,\\nif she had the least mind for it, to put an end to the\\nmatter directly, and leave him shift for himself.\\ni heard him say all this as plain as could possibly be.\\nand it was entirely for her sake, and upon her account,\\nthat he said a word about being off, and not upon his own.\\ni will take my oath he never dropt a syllable of being\\ntired of her, or of wishing to marry miss morton, or any\\nthing like it.  but, to be sure, lucy would not give\\near to such kind of talking; so she told him directly\\n(with a great deal about sweet and love, you know,\\nand all that--oh, la! one can\\'t repeat such kind of things\\nyou know)--she told him directly, she had not the least\\nmind in the world to be off, for she could live with him\\nupon a trifle, and how little so ever he might have,\\nshe should be very glad to have it all, you know,\\nor something of the kind.  so then he was monstrous happy,\\nand talked on some time about what they should do,\\nand they agreed he should take orders directly,\\nand they must wait to be married till he got a living.\\nand just then i could not hear any more, for my cousin\\ncalled from below to tell me mrs. richardson was come in\\nher coach, and would take one of us to kensington gardens;\\nso i was forced to go into the room and interrupt them,\\nto ask lucy if she would like to go, but she did not\\ncare to leave edward; so i just run up stairs and put\\non a pair of silk stockings and came off with the richardsons.\"\\n\\n\"i do not understand what you mean by interrupting them,\"\\nsaid elinor; \"you were all in the same room together,\\nwere not you?\"\\n\\n\"no, indeed, not us.  la! miss dashwood, do you\\nthink people make love when any body else is by?  oh,\\nfor shame!--to be sure you must know better than that.\\n(laughing affectedly.)--no, no; they were shut up in the\\ndrawing-room together, and all i heard was only by listening\\nat the door.\"\\n\\n\"how!\" cried elinor; \"have you been repeating to me\\nwhat you only learnt yourself by listening at the door?\\ni am sorry i did not know it before; for i certainly\\nwould not have suffered you to give me particulars of a\\nconversation which you ought not to have known yourself.\\nhow could you behave so unfairly by your sister?\"\\n\\n\"oh, la! there is nothing in that.  i only stood at\\nthe door, and heard what i could.  and i am sure lucy would\\nhave done just the same by me; for a year or two back,\\nwhen martha sharpe and i had so many secrets together,\\nshe never made any bones of hiding in a closet, or behind\\na chimney-board, on purpose to hear what we said.\"\\n\\nelinor tried to talk of something else; but miss\\nsteele could not be kept beyond a couple of minutes,\\nfrom what was uppermost in her mind.\\n\\n\"edward talks of going to oxford soon,\" said she;\\n\"but now he is lodging at no. --, pall mall.  what an\\nill-natured woman his mother is, an\\'t she? and your\\nbrother and sister were not very kind! however,\\ni shan\\'t say anything against them to you; and to be sure\\nthey did send us home in their own chariot, which\\nwas more than i looked for.  and for my part, i was all\\nin a fright for fear your sister should ask us for the\\nhuswifes she had gave us a day or two before; but, however,\\nnothing was said about them, and i took care to keep mine\\nout of sight.  edward have got some business at oxford,\\nhe says; so he must go there for a time; and after that,\\nas soon as he can light upon a bishop, he will be ordained.\\ni wonder what curacy he will get!--good gracious!\\n(giggling as she spoke) i\\'d lay my life i know what\\nmy cousins will say, when they hear of it.  they will\\ntell me i should write to the doctor, to get edward\\nthe curacy of his new living.  i know they will; but i am\\nsure i would not do such a thing for all the world.--\\n\\'la!\\' i shall say directly, \\'i wonder how you could think\\nof such a thing?  i write to the doctor, indeed!\\'\"\\n\\n\"well,\" said elinor, \"it is a comfort to be prepared\\nagainst the worst.  you have got your answer ready.\"\\n\\nmiss steele was going to reply on the same subject,\\nbut the approach of her own party made another more necessary.\\n\\n\"oh, la! here come the richardsons.  i had a vast deal\\nmore to say to you, but i must not stay away from them not\\nany longer.  i assure you they are very genteel people.\\nhe makes a monstrous deal of money, and they keep their\\nown coach.  i have not time to speak to mrs. jennings about\\nit myself, but pray tell her i am quite happy to hear she\\nis not in anger against us, and lady middleton the same;\\nand if anything should happen to take you and your\\nsister away, and mrs. jennings should want company,\\ni am sure we should be very glad to come and stay with her\\nfor as long a time as she likes.  i suppose lady middleton\\nwon\\'t ask us any more this bout.  good-by; i am sorry\\nmiss marianne was not here.  remember me kindly to her.\\nla! if you have not got your spotted muslin on!--i wonder\\nyou was not afraid of its being torn.\"\\n\\nsuch was her parting concern; for after this, she had\\ntime only to pay her farewell compliments to mrs. jennings,\\nbefore her company was claimed by mrs. richardson;\\nand elinor was left in possession of knowledge which\\nmight feed her powers of reflection some time, though she\\nhad learnt very little more than what had been already\\nforeseen and foreplanned in her own mind.  edward\\'s marriage\\nwith lucy was as firmly determined on, and the time\\nof its taking place remained as absolutely uncertain,\\nas she had concluded it would be;--every thing depended,\\nexactly after her expectation, on his getting that preferment,\\nof which, at present, there seemed not the smallest chance.\\n\\nas soon as they returned to the carriage,\\nmrs. jennings was eager for information; but as elinor\\nwished to spread as little as possible intelligence\\nthat had in the first place been so unfairly obtained,\\nshe confined herself to the brief repetition of such\\nsimple particulars, as she felt assured that lucy,\\nfor the sake of her own consequence, would choose\\nto have known.  the continuance of their engagement,\\nand the means that were able to be taken for promoting\\nits end, was all her communication; and this produced\\nfrom mrs. jennings the following natural remark.\\n\\n\"wait for his having a living!--ay, we all know how\\nthat will end:--they will wait a twelvemonth, and finding\\nno good comes of it, will set down upon a curacy of fifty\\npounds a-year, with the interest of his two thousand pounds,\\nand what little matter mr. steele and mr. pratt can\\ngive her.--then they will have a child every year! and\\nlord help \\'em! how poor they will be!--i must see\\nwhat i can give them towards furnishing their house.\\ntwo maids and two men, indeed!--as i talked of t\\'other\\nday.--no, no, they must get a stout girl of all works.--\\nbetty\\'s sister would never do for them now.\"\\n\\nthe next morning brought elinor a letter by the\\ntwo-penny post from lucy herself.  it was as follows:\\n\\n                    \"bartlett\\'s building, march.\\n\\n     \"i hope my dear miss dashwood will excuse the\\n     liberty i take of writing to her; but i know your\\n     friendship for me will make you pleased to hear such\\n     a good account of myself and my dear edward, after\\n     all the troubles we have went through lately,\\n     therefore will make no more apologies, but proceed\\n     to say that, thank god! though we have suffered\\n     dreadfully, we are both quite well now, and as happy\\n     as we must always be in one another\\'s love.  we have\\n     had great trials, and great persecutions, but\\n     however, at the same time, gratefully acknowledge\\n     many friends, yourself not the least among them,\\n     whose great kindness i shall always thankfully\\n     remember, as will edward too, who i have told of\\n     it.  i am sure you will be glad to hear, as likewise\\n     dear mrs. jennings, i spent two happy hours with\\n     him yesterday afternoon, he would not hear of our\\n     parting, though earnestly did i, as i thought my\\n     duty required, urge him to it for prudence sake,\\n     and would have parted for ever on the spot, would\\n     he consent to it; but he said it should never be,\\n     he did not regard his mother\\'s anger, while he could\\n     have my affections; our prospects are not very\\n     bright, to be sure, but we must wait, and hope for\\n     the best; he will be ordained shortly; and should\\n     it ever be in your power to recommend him to any\\n     body that has a living to bestow, am very sure you\\n     will not forget us, and dear mrs. jennings too,\\n     trust she will speak a good word for us to sir john,\\n     or mr. palmer, or any friend that may be able to\\n     assist us.--poor anne was much to blame for what\\n     she did, but she did it for the best, so i say\\n     nothing; hope mrs. jennings won\\'t think it too much\\n     trouble to give us a call, should she come this way\\n     any morning, \\'twould be a great kindness, and my\\n     cousins would be proud to know her.--my paper reminds\\n     me to conclude; and begging to be most gratefully\\n     and respectfully remembered to her, and to sir john,\\n     and lady middleton, and the dear children, when you\\n     chance to see them, and love to miss marianne,\\n\\n                                      \"i am, &c.\"\\n\\nas soon as elinor had finished it, she performed\\nwhat she concluded to be its writer\\'s real design,\\nby placing it in the hands of mrs. jennings, who read it\\naloud with many comments of satisfaction and praise.\\n\\n\"very well indeed!--how prettily she writes!--aye,\\nthat was quite proper to let him be off if he would.\\nthat was just like lucy.--poor soul! i wish i could get\\nhim a living, with all my heart.--she calls me dear\\nmrs. jennings, you see.  she is a good-hearted girl\\nas ever lived.--very well upon my word.  that sentence\\nis very prettily turned.  yes, yes, i will go and see her,\\nsure enough.  how attentive she is, to think of every\\nbody!--thank you, my dear, for shewing it me.  it is\\nas pretty a letter as ever i saw, and does lucy\\'s head\\nand heart great credit.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 39\\n\\n\\nthe miss dashwoods had now been rather more than\\ntwo months in town, and marianne\\'s impatience to be gone\\nincreased every day.  she sighed for the air, the liberty,\\nthe quiet of the country; and fancied that if any place\\ncould give her ease, barton must do it.  elinor was hardly\\nless anxious than herself for their removal, and only so much\\nless bent on its being effected immediately, as that she\\nwas conscious of the difficulties of so long a journey,\\nwhich marianne could not be brought to acknowledge.\\nshe began, however, seriously to turn her thoughts towards\\nits accomplishment, and had already mentioned their wishes\\nto their kind hostess, who resisted them with all the\\neloquence of her good-will, when a plan was suggested,\\nwhich, though detaining them from home yet a few weeks\\nlonger, appeared to elinor altogether much more eligible\\nthan any other. the palmers were to remove to cleveland\\nabout the end of march, for the easter holidays;\\nand mrs. jennings, with both her friends, received a very\\nwarm invitation from charlotte to go with them.  this would\\nnot, in itself, have been sufficient for the delicacy of\\nmiss dashwood;--but it was inforced with so much real\\npoliteness by mr. palmer himself, as, joined to the very\\ngreat amendment of his manners towards them since her\\nsister had been known to be unhappy, induced her to accept\\nit with pleasure.\\n\\nwhen she told marianne what she had done, however,\\nher first reply was not very auspicious.\\n\\n\"cleveland!\"--she cried, with great agitation.\\n\"no, i cannot go to cleveland.\"--\\n\\n\"you forget,\" said elinor gently, \"that its situation\\nis not...that it is not in the neighbourhood of...\"\\n\\n\"but it is in somersetshire.--i cannot go\\ninto somersetshire.--there, where i looked forward\\nto going...no, elinor, you cannot expect me to go there.\"\\n\\nelinor would not argue upon the propriety of overcoming\\nsuch feelings;--she only endeavoured to counteract them by\\nworking on others;--represented it, therefore, as a measure\\nwhich would fix the time of her returning to that dear mother,\\nwhom she so much wished to see, in a more eligible,\\nmore comfortable manner, than any other plan could do,\\nand perhaps without any greater delay.  from cleveland,\\nwhich was within a few miles of bristol, the distance to\\nbarton was not beyond one day, though a long day\\'s journey;\\nand their mother\\'s servant might easily come there to attend\\nthem down; and as there could be no occasion of their\\nstaying above a week at cleveland, they might now be at\\nhome in little more than three weeks\\' time.  as marianne\\'s\\naffection for her mother was sincere, it must triumph\\nwith little difficulty, over the imaginary evils she had started.\\n\\nmrs. jennings was so far from being weary of her guest,\\nthat she pressed them very earnestly to return with her again\\nfrom cleveland.  elinor was grateful for the attention,\\nbut it could not alter her design; and their mother\\'s\\nconcurrence being readily gained, every thing relative\\nto their return was arranged as far as it could be;--\\nand marianne found some relief in drawing up a statement\\nof the hours that were yet to divide her from barton.\\n\\n\"ah! colonel, i do not know what you and i shall\\ndo without the miss dashwoods;\"--was mrs. jennings\\'s\\naddress to him when he first called on her, after their\\nleaving her was settled--\"for they are quite resolved\\nupon going home from the palmers;--and how forlorn we\\nshall be, when i come back!--lord! we shall sit and gape\\nat one another as dull as two cats.\"\\n\\nperhaps mrs. jennings was in hopes, by this vigorous\\nsketch of their future ennui, to provoke him to make\\nthat offer, which might give himself an escape from it;--\\nand if so, she had soon afterwards good reason to think\\nher object gained; for, on elinor\\'s moving to the window\\nto take more expeditiously the dimensions of a print,\\nwhich she was going to copy for her friend, he followed\\nher to it with a look of particular meaning, and conversed\\nwith her there for several minutes.  the effect of his\\ndiscourse on the lady too, could not escape her observation,\\nfor though she was too honorable to listen, and had even\\nchanged her seat, on purpose that she might not hear,\\nto one close by the piano forte on which marianne\\nwas playing, she could not keep herself from seeing\\nthat elinor changed colour, attended with agitation,\\nand was too intent on what he said to pursue her employment.--\\nstill farther in confirmation of her hopes, in the interval\\nof marianne\\'s turning from one lesson to another,\\nsome words of the colonel\\'s inevitably reached her ear,\\nin which he seemed to be apologising for the badness\\nof his house.  this set the matter beyond a doubt.\\nshe wondered, indeed, at his thinking it necessary\\nto do so; but supposed it to be the proper etiquette.\\nwhat elinor said in reply she could not distinguish,\\nbut judged from the motion of her lips, that she did\\nnot think that any material objection;--and mrs. jennings\\ncommended her in her heart for being so honest.\\nthey then talked on for a few minutes longer without her\\ncatching a syllable, when another lucky stop in marianne\\'s\\nperformance brought her these words in the colonel\\'s calm voice,--\\n\\n\"i am afraid it cannot take place very soon.\"\\n\\nastonished and shocked at so unlover-like a speech,\\nshe was almost ready to cry out, \"lord! what should\\nhinder it?\"--but checking her desire, confined herself\\nto this silent ejaculation.\\n\\n\"this is very strange!--sure he need not wait to be older.\"\\n\\nthis delay on the colonel\\'s side, however, did not\\nseem to offend or mortify his fair companion in the least,\\nfor on their breaking up the conference soon afterwards,\\nand moving different ways, mrs. jennings very plainly heard\\nelinor say, and with a voice which shewed her to feel what she said,\\n\\n\"i shall always think myself very much obliged to you.\"\\n\\nmrs. jennings was delighted with her gratitude,\\nand only wondered that after hearing such a sentence,\\nthe colonel should be able to take leave of them, as he\\nimmediately did, with the utmost sang-froid, and go away\\nwithout making her any reply!--she had not thought her old\\nfriend could have made so indifferent a suitor.\\n\\nwhat had really passed between them was to this effect.\\n\\n\"i have heard,\" said he, with great compassion,\\n\"of the injustice your friend mr. ferrars has suffered\\nfrom his family; for if i understand the matter right,\\nhe has been entirely cast off by them for persevering\\nin his engagement with a very deserving young woman.--\\nhave i been rightly informed?--is it so?--\"\\n\\nelinor told him that it was.\\n\\n\"the cruelty, the impolitic cruelty,\"--he replied,\\nwith great feeling,--\"of dividing, or attempting to divide,\\ntwo young people long attached to each other, is terrible.--\\nmrs. ferrars does not know what she may be doing--what\\nshe may drive her son to.  i have seen mr. ferrars two\\nor three times in harley street, and am much pleased\\nwith him.  he is not a young man with whom one can\\nbe intimately acquainted in a short time, but i have\\nseen enough of him to wish him well for his own sake,\\nand as a friend of yours, i wish it still more.\\ni understand that he intends to take orders.  will you\\nbe so good as to tell him that the living of delaford,\\nnow just vacant, as i am informed by this day\\'s post,\\nis his, if he think it worth his acceptance--but that,\\nperhaps, so unfortunately circumstanced as he is now,\\nit may be  nonsense to appear to doubt; i only wish it\\nwere more  valuable.-- it is a rectory, but a small one;\\nthe late incumbent, i believe, did not make more than\\n200 l per annum, and though it is certainly capable\\nof improvement, i fear, not to such an amount as\\nto afford him a very comfortable income.  such as it is,\\nhowever, my pleasure in presenting him to it,\\nwill be very great.  pray assure him of it.\"\\n\\nelinor\\'s astonishment at this commission could\\nhardly have been greater, had the colonel been really\\nmaking her an offer of his hand.  the preferment,\\nwhich only two days before she had considered as hopeless\\nfor edward, was already provided to enable him to marry;--\\nand she, of all people in the world, was fixed on to\\nbestow it!--her emotion was such as mrs. jennings had\\nattributed to a very different cause;--but whatever minor\\nfeelings less pure, less pleasing, might have a share\\nin that emotion, her esteem for the general benevolence,\\nand her gratitude for the particular friendship,\\nwhich together prompted colonel brandon to this act,\\nwere strongly felt, and warmly expressed.  she thanked him\\nfor it with all her heart, spoke of edward\\'s principles and\\ndisposition with that praise which she knew them to deserve;\\nand promised to undertake the commission with pleasure,\\nif it were really his wish to put off so agreeable an office\\nto another.  but at the same time, she could not help\\nthinking that no one could so well perform it as himself.\\nit was an office in short, from which, unwilling to give\\nedward the pain of receiving an obligation from her,\\nshe would have been very glad to be spared herself;--\\nbut colonel brandon, on motives of equal delicacy,\\ndeclining it likewise, still seemed so desirous of its being\\ngiven through her means, that she would not on any account\\nmake farther opposition.  edward, she believed, was still in\\ntown,\\nand fortunately she had heard his address from miss steele.\\nshe could undertake therefore to inform him of it,\\nin the course of the day.  after this had been settled,\\ncolonel brandon began to talk of his own advantage\\nin securing so respectable and agreeable a neighbour,\\nand then it was that he mentioned with regret, that the\\nhouse was small and indifferent;--an evil which elinor,\\nas mrs. jennings had supposed her to do, made very light of,\\nat least as far as regarded its size.\\n\\n\"the smallness of the house,\" said she,\\n\"i cannot imagine any inconvenience to them,\\nfor it will be in proportion to their family and income.\"\\n\\nby which the colonel was surprised to find that she\\nwas considering mr. ferrars\\'s marriage as the certain\\nconsequence of the presentation; for he did not suppose it\\npossible that delaford living could supply such an income,\\nas anybody in his style of life would venture to settle on--\\nand he said so.\\n\\n\"this little rectory can do no more than make mr. ferrars\\ncomfortable as a bachelor; it cannot enable him to marry.\\ni am sorry to say that my patronage ends with this;\\nand my interest is hardly more extensive.  if, however,\\nby an unforeseen chance it should be in my power to serve\\nhim farther, i must think very differently of him\\nfrom what i now do, if i am not as ready to be useful\\nto him then as i sincerely wish i could be at present.\\nwhat i am now doing indeed, seems nothing at all,\\nsince it can advance him so little towards what must\\nbe his principal, his only object of happiness.\\nhis marriage must still be a distant good;--at least,\\ni am afraid it cannot take place very soon.--\"\\n\\nsuch was the sentence which, when misunderstood,\\nso justly offended the delicate feelings of mrs. jennings;\\nbut after this narration of what really passed between\\ncolonel brandon and elinor, while they stood at the window,\\nthe gratitude expressed by the latter on their parting, may\\nperhaps appear in general, not less reasonably excited,\\nnor less properly worded than if it had arisen from\\nan offer of marriage.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 40\\n\\n\\n\"well, miss dashwood,\" said mrs. jennings,\\nsagaciously smiling, as soon as the gentleman had withdrawn,\\n\"i do not ask you what the colonel has been saying to you;\\nfor though, upon my honour, i tried to keep out of hearing,\\ni could not help catching enough to understand his business.\\nand i assure you i never was better pleased in my life,\\nand i wish you joy of it with all my heart.\"\\n\\n\"thank you, ma\\'am,\" said elinor.  \"it is a matter\\nof great joy to me; and i feel the goodness of colonel\\nbrandon most sensibly.  there are not many men who would\\nact as he has done.  few people who have so compassionate\\na heart!  i never was more astonished in my life.\"\\n\\n\"lord! my dear, you are very modest.  i an\\'t the least\\nastonished at it in the world, for i have often thought\\nof late, there was nothing more likely to happen.\"\\n\\n\"you judged from your knowledge of the colonel\\'s\\ngeneral benevolence; but at least you could not foresee\\nthat the opportunity would so very soon occur.\"\\n\\n\"opportunity!\" repeated mrs. jennings--\"oh! as to that,\\nwhen a man has once made up his mind to such a thing,\\nsomehow or other he will soon find an opportunity.\\nwell, my dear, i wish you joy of it again and again;\\nand if ever there was a happy couple in the world, i think\\ni shall soon know where to look for them.\"\\n\\n\"you mean to go to delaford after them i suppose,\"\\nsaid elinor, with a faint smile.\\n\\n\"aye, my dear, that i do, indeed.  and as to the house\\nbeing a bad one, i do not know what the colonel would be at,\\nfor it is as good a one as ever i saw.\"\\n\\n\"he spoke of its being out of repair.\"\\n\\n\"well, and whose fault is that? why don\\'t he repair it?--\\nwho should do it but himself?\"\\n\\nthey were interrupted by the servant\\'s coming in to\\nannounce the carriage being at the door; and mrs. jennings\\nimmediately preparing to go, said,--\\n\\n\"well, my dear, i must be gone before i have had half\\nmy talk out.  but, however, we may have it all over in\\nthe evening; for we shall be quite alone.  i do not ask\\nyou to go with me, for i dare say your mind is too full\\nof the matter to care for company; and besides, you must\\nlong to tell your sister all about it.\"\\n\\nmarianne had left the room before the conversation began.\\n\\n\"certainly, ma\\'am, i shall tell marianne of it;\\nbut i shall not mention it at present to any body else.\"\\n\\n\"oh! very well,\" said mrs. jennings rather disappointed.\\n\"then you would not have me tell it to lucy, for i think\\nof going as far as holborn to-day.\"\\n\\n\"no, ma\\'am, not even lucy if you please.\\none day\\'s delay will not be very material; and till i\\nhave written to mr. ferrars, i think it ought not to be\\nmentioned to any body else.  i shall do that directly.\\nit is of importance that no time should be lost with him,\\nfor he will of course have much to do relative to\\nhis ordination.\"\\n\\nthis speech at first puzzled mrs. jennings exceedingly.\\nwhy mr. ferrars was to have been written to about it\\nin such a hurry, she could not immediately comprehend.\\na few moments\\' reflection, however, produced a very happy idea,\\nand she exclaimed;--\\n\\n\"oh, ho!--i understand you.  mr. ferrars is to be\\nthe man.  well, so much the better for him.  ay, to be sure,\\nhe must be ordained in readiness; and i am very glad\\nto find things are so forward between you.  but, my dear,\\nis not this rather out of character?  should not the colonel\\nwrite himself?--sure, he is the proper person.\"\\n\\nelinor did not quite understand the beginning of\\nmrs. jennings\\'s speech, neither did she think it worth\\ninquiring into; and therefore only replied to its conclusion.\\n\\n\"colonel brandon is so delicate a man, that he rather\\nwished any one to announce his intentions to mr. ferrars\\nthan himself.\"\\n\\n\"and so you are forced to do it.  well that is an odd\\nkind of delicacy!  however, i will not disturb you (seeing\\nher preparing to write.)  you know your own concerns best.\\nso goodby, my dear.  i have not heard of any thing to\\nplease me so well since charlotte was brought to bed.\"\\n\\nand away she went; but returning again in a moment,\\n\\n\"i have just been thinking of betty\\'s sister, my dear.\\ni should be very glad to get her so good a mistress.\\nbut whether she would do for a lady\\'s maid, i am sure i\\ncan\\'t tell.  she is an excellent housemaid, and works\\nvery well at her needle.  however, you will think of all\\nthat at your leisure.\"\\n\\n\"certainly, ma\\'am,\" replied elinor, not hearing\\nmuch of what she said, and more anxious to be alone,\\nthan to be mistress of the subject.\\n\\nhow she should begin--how she should express\\nherself in her note to edward, was now all her concern.\\nthe particular circumstances between them made\\na difficulty of that which to any other person would\\nhave been the easiest thing in the world; but she\\nequally feared to say too much or too little, and sat\\ndeliberating over her paper, with the pen in her band,\\ntill broken in on by the entrance of edward himself.\\n\\nhe had met mrs. jennings at the door in her way to\\nthe carriage, as he came to leave his farewell card; and she,\\nafter apologising for not returning herself, had obliged\\nhim to enter, by saying that miss dashwood was above,\\nand wanted to speak with him on very particular business.\\n\\nelinor had just been congratulating herself,\\nin the midst of her perplexity, that however difficult it\\nmight be to express herself properly by letter, it was\\nat least preferable to giving the information by word\\nof mouth, when her visitor entered, to force her upon this\\ngreatest exertion of all.  her astonishment and confusion\\nwere very great on his so sudden appearance.  she had\\nnot seen him before since his engagement became public,\\nand therefore not since his knowing her to be acquainted\\nwith it; which, with the consciousness of what she\\nhad been thinking of, and what she had to tell him,\\nmade her feel particularly uncomfortable for some minutes.\\nhe too was much distressed; and they sat down together\\nin a most promising state of embarrassment.--whether he\\nhad asked her pardon for his intrusion on first coming\\ninto the room, he could not recollect; but determining\\nto be on the safe side, he made his apology in form\\nas soon as he could say any thing, after taking a chair.\\n\\n\"mrs. jennings told me,\" said he, \"that you wished\\nto speak with me, at least i understood her so--or i\\ncertainly should not have intruded on you in such a manner;\\nthough at the same time, i should have been extremely\\nsorry to leave london without seeing you and your sister;\\nespecially as it will most likely be some time--it\\nis not probable that i should soon have the pleasure\\nof meeting you again.  i go to oxford tomorrow.\"\\n\\n\"you would not have gone, however,\" said elinor,\\nrecovering herself, and determined to get over what she\\nso much dreaded as soon as possible, \"without receiving\\nour good wishes, even if we had not been able to give them\\nin person.  mrs. jennings was quite right in what she said.\\ni have something of consequence to inform you of,\\nwhich i was on the point of communicating by paper.\\ni am charged with a most agreeable office (breathing\\nrather faster than usual as she spoke.)  colonel brandon,\\nwho was here only ten minutes ago, has desired me to say,\\nthat understanding you mean to take orders, he has\\ngreat pleasure in offering you the living of delaford\\nnow just vacant, and only wishes it were more valuable.\\nallow me to congratulate you on having so respectable\\nand well-judging a friend, and to join in his wish that\\nthe living--it is about two hundred a-year--were much\\nmore considerable, and such as might better enable you\\nto--as might be more than a temporary accommodation to\\nyourself--such, in short, as might establish all your views\\nof happiness.\"\\n\\nwhat edward felt, as he could not say it himself,\\nit cannot be expected that any one else should say for him.\\nhe looked all the astonishment which such unexpected,\\nsuch unthought-of information could not fail of exciting;\\nbut he said only these two words,\\n\\n\"colonel brandon!\"\\n\\n\"yes,\" continued elinor, gathering more resolution,\\nas some of the worst was over, \"colonel brandon means\\nit as a testimony of his concern for what has lately\\npassed--for the cruel situation in which the unjustifiable\\nconduct of your family has placed you--a concern\\nwhich i am sure marianne, myself, and all your friends,\\nmust share; and likewise as a proof of his high esteem\\nfor your general character, and his particular approbation\\nof your behaviour on the present occasion.\"\\n\\n\"colonel brandon give me a living!--can it be possible?\"\\n\\n\"the unkindness of your own relations has made you\\nastonished to find friendship any where.\"\\n\\n\"no,\" replied be, with sudden consciousness, \"not to\\nfind it in you; for i cannot be ignorant that to you,\\nto your goodness, i owe it all.--i feel it--i would express\\nit if i could--but, as you well know, i am no orator.\"\\n\\n\"you are very much mistaken.  i do assure you\\nthat you owe it entirely, at least almost entirely,\\nto your own merit, and colonel brandon\\'s discernment\\nof it.  i have had no hand in it.  i did not even know,\\ntill i understood his design, that the living was vacant;\\nnor had it ever occurred to me that he might have\\nhad such a living in his gift.  as a friend of mine,\\nof my family, he may, perhaps--indeed i know he has,\\nstill greater pleasure in bestowing it; but, upon my word,\\nyou owe nothing to my solicitation.\"\\n\\ntruth obliged her to acknowledge some small share\\nin the action, but she was at the same time so unwilling\\nto appear as the benefactress of edward, that she acknowledged\\nit with hesitation; which probably contributed to fix\\nthat suspicion in his mind which had recently entered it.\\nfor a short time he sat deep in thought, after elinor had ceased\\nto speak;--at last, and as if it were rather an effort, he said,\\n\\n\"colonel brandon seems a man of great worth and respectability.\\ni have always heard him spoken of as such, and your brother\\ni know esteems him highly.  he is undoubtedly a sensible man,\\nand in his manners perfectly the gentleman.\"\\n\\n\"indeed,\" replied elinor, \"i believe that you will find him,\\non farther acquaintance, all that you have heard him to be,\\nand as you will be such very near neighbours (for i understand\\nthe parsonage is almost close to the mansion-house,)\\nit is particularly important that he should be all this.\"\\n\\nedward made no answer; but when she had turned\\naway her head, gave her a look so serious, so earnest,\\nso uncheerful, as seemed to say, that he might hereafter wish\\nthe distance between the parsonage and the mansion-house\\nmuch greater.\\n\\n\"colonel brandon, i think, lodges in st. james street,\"\\nsaid he, soon afterwards, rising from his chair.\\n\\nelinor told him the number of the house.\\n\\n\"i must hurry away then, to give him those thanks\\nwhich you will not allow me to give you; to assure him\\nthat he has made me a very--an exceedingly happy man.\"\\n\\nelinor did not offer to detain him; and they parted,\\nwith a very earnest assurance on her side of her unceasing\\ngood wishes for his happiness in every change of situation\\nthat might befall him; on his, with rather an attempt to\\nreturn the same good will, than the power of expressing it.\\n\\n\"when i see him again,\" said elinor to herself,\\nas the door shut him out, \"i shall see him the husband\\nof lucy.\"\\n\\nand with this pleasing anticipation, she sat down\\nto reconsider the past, recall the words and endeavour\\nto comprehend all the feelings of edward; and, of course,\\nto reflect on her own with discontent.\\n\\nwhen mrs. jennings came home, though she returned\\nfrom seeing people whom she had never seen before,\\nand of whom therefore she must have a great deal to say,\\nher mind was so much more occupied by the important secret\\nin her possession, than by anything else, that she\\nreverted to it again as soon as elinor appeared.\\n\\n\"well, my dear,\" she cried, \"i sent you up to the\\nyoung man.  did not i do right?--and i suppose you had\\nno great difficulty--you did not find him very unwilling\\nto accept your proposal?\"\\n\\n\"no, ma\\'am; that was not very likely.\"\\n\\n\"well, and how soon will he be ready?--for it seems\\nall to depend upon that.\"\\n\\n\"really,\" said elinor, \"i know so little of these kind\\nof forms, that i can hardly even conjecture as to the time,\\nor the preparation necessary; but i suppose two or three\\nmonths will complete his ordination.\"\\n\\n\"two or three months!\" cried mrs. jennings; \"lord! my dear,\\nhow calmly you talk of it; and can the colonel wait two\\nor three months! lord bless me!--i am sure it would put me\\nquite out of patience!--and though one would be very glad\\nto do a kindness by poor mr. ferrars, i do think it is\\nnot worth while to wait two or three months for him.\\nsure somebody else might be found that would do as well;\\nsomebody that is in orders already.\"\\n\\n\"my dear ma\\'am,\" said elinor, \"what can you be thinking of?--\\nwhy, colonel brandon\\'s only object is to be of use to mr. ferrars.\"\\n\\n\"lord bless you, my dear!--sure you do not mean to persuade\\nme that the colonel only marries you for the sake of giving\\nten guineas to mr. ferrars!\"\\n\\nthe deception could not continue after this;\\nand an explanation immediately took place, by which both\\ngained considerable amusement for the moment, without any\\nmaterial loss of happiness to either, for mrs. jennings\\nonly exchanged one form of delight for another, and still\\nwithout forfeiting her expectation of the first.\\n\\n\"aye, aye, the parsonage is but a small one,\" said she,\\nafter the first ebullition of surprise and satisfaction\\nwas over, \"and very likely may be out of repair; but to hear\\na man apologising, as i thought, for a house that to my\\nknowledge has five sitting rooms on the ground-floor, and i\\nthink the housekeeper told me could make up fifteen beds!--\\nand to you too, that had been used to live in barton cottage!--\\nit seems quite ridiculous.  but, my dear, we must\\ntouch up the colonel to do some thing to the parsonage,\\nand make it comfortable for them, before lucy goes to it.\"\\n\\n\"but colonel brandon does not seem to have any idea\\nof the living\\'s being enough to allow them to marry.\"\\n\\n\"the colonel is a ninny, my dear; because he has two\\nthousand a-year himself, he thinks that nobody else can marry\\non less.  take my word for it, that, if i am alive, i shall\\nbe paying a visit at delaford parsonage before michaelmas;\\nand i am sure i sha\\'nt go if lucy an\\'t there.\"\\n\\nelinor was quite of her opinion, as to the probability\\nof their not waiting for any thing more.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 41\\n\\n\\nedward, having carried his thanks to colonel brandon,\\nproceeded with his happiness to lucy; and such was the\\nexcess of it by the time he reached bartlett\\'s buildings,\\nthat she was able to assure mrs. jennings, who called\\non her again the next day with her congratulations,\\nthat she had never seen him in such spirits before\\nin her life.\\n\\nher own happiness, and her own spirits, were at\\nleast very certain; and she joined mrs. jennings most\\nheartily in her expectation of their being all comfortably\\ntogether in delaford parsonage before michaelmas.\\nso far was she, at the same time, from any backwardness\\nto give elinor that credit which edward would give her,\\nthat she spoke of her friendship for them both with the most\\ngrateful warmth, was ready to own all their obligation\\nto her, and openly declared that no exertion for their\\ngood on miss dashwood\\'s part, either present or future,\\nwould ever surprise her, for she believed her capable of\\ndoing any thing in the world for those she really valued.\\nas for colonel brandon, she was not only ready to worship\\nhim as a saint, but was moreover truly anxious that\\nhe should be treated as one in all worldly concerns;\\nanxious that his tithes should be raised to the utmost;\\nand scarcely resolved to avail herself, at delaford,\\nas far as she possibly could, of his servants, his carriage,\\nhis cows, and his poultry.\\n\\nit was now above a week since john dashwood had\\ncalled in berkeley street, and as since that time no notice\\nhad been taken by them of his wife\\'s indisposition,\\nbeyond one verbal enquiry, elinor began to feel it\\nnecessary to pay her a visit.--this was an obligation,\\nhowever, which not only opposed her own inclination,\\nbut which had not the assistance of any encouragement\\nfrom her companions.  marianne, not contented with\\nabsolutely refusing to go herself, was very urgent\\nto prevent her sister\\'s going at all; and mrs. jennings,\\nthough her carriage was always at elinor\\'s service,\\nso very much disliked mrs. john dashwood, that not even her\\ncuriosity to see how she looked after the late discovery,\\nnor her strong desire to affront her by taking edward\\'s part,\\ncould overcome her unwillingness to be in her company again.\\nthe consequence was, that elinor set out by herself\\nto pay a visit, for which no one could really have\\nless inclination, and to run the risk of a tete-a-tete\\nwith a woman, whom neither of the others had so much\\nreason to dislike.\\n\\nmrs. dashwood was denied; but before the carriage could\\nturn from the house, her husband accidentally came out.\\nhe expressed great pleasure in meeting elinor, told her\\nthat he had been just going to call in berkeley street,\\nand, assuring her that fanny would be very glad to see her,\\ninvited her to come in.\\n\\nthey walked up stairs in to the drawing-room.--nobody was there.\\n\\n\"fanny is in her own room, i suppose,\" said he:--\"i\\nwill go to her presently, for i am sure she will not\\nhave the least objection in the world to seeing you.--\\nvery far from it, indeed.  now especially there\\ncannot be--but however, you and marianne were always\\ngreat favourites.--why would not marianne come?\"--\\n\\nelinor made what excuse she could for her.\\n\\n\"i am not sorry to see you alone,\" he replied,\\n\"for i have a good deal to say to you.  this living\\nof colonel brandon\\'s--can it be true?--has he really given\\nit to edward?--i heard it yesterday by chance, and was\\ncoming to you on purpose to enquire farther about it.\"\\n\\n\"it is perfectly true.--colonel brandon has given\\nthe living of delaford to edward.\"\\n\\n\"really!--well, this is very astonishing!--no\\nrelationship!--no connection between them!--and now\\nthat livings fetch such a price!--what was the value of this?\"\\n\\n\"about two hundred a year.\"\\n\\n\"very well--and for the next presentation to a living\\nof that value--supposing the late incumbent to have\\nbeen old and sickly, and likely to vacate it soon--he\\nmight have got i dare say--fourteen hundred pounds.\\nand how came he not to have settled that matter before this\\nperson\\'s death?--now indeed it would be too late to sell it,\\nbut a man of colonel brandon\\'s sense!--i wonder he should\\nbe so improvident in a point of such common, such natural,\\nconcern!--well, i am convinced that there is a vast deal\\nof inconsistency in almost every human character.  i suppose,\\nhowever--on recollection--that the case may probably be this.\\nedward is only to hold the living till the person to whom\\nthe colonel has really sold the presentation, is old enough\\nto take it.--aye, aye, that is the fact, depend upon it.\"\\n\\nelinor contradicted it, however, very positively;\\nand by relating that she had herself been employed\\nin conveying the offer from colonel brandon to edward,\\nand, therefore, must understand the terms on which it\\nwas given, obliged him to submit to her authority.\\n\\n\"it is truly astonishing!\"--he cried, after hearing\\nwhat she said--\"what could be the colonel\\'s motive?\"\\n\\n\"a very simple one--to be of use to mr. ferrars.\"\\n\\n\"well, well; whatever colonel brandon may be,\\nedward is a very lucky man.--you will not mention the matter\\nto fanny, however, for though i have broke it to her,\\nand she bears it vastly well,--she will not like to hear\\nit much talked of.\"\\n\\nelinor had some difficulty here to refrain from observing,\\nthat she thought fanny might have borne with composure,\\nan acquisition of wealth to her brother, by which neither\\nshe nor her child could be possibly impoverished.\\n\\n\"mrs. ferrars,\" added he, lowering his voice to the\\ntone becoming so important a subject, \"knows nothing\\nabout it at present, and i believe it will be best to\\nkeep it entirely concealed from her as long as may be.--\\nwhen the marriage takes place, i fear she must hear\\nof it all.\"\\n\\n\"but why should such precaution be used?--though\\nit is not to be supposed that mrs. ferrars can have\\nthe smallest satisfaction in knowing that her son has\\nmoney enough to live upon,--for that must be quite\\nout of the question; yet why, upon her late behaviour,\\nis she supposed to feel at all?--she has done with her\\nson, she cast him off for ever, and has made all those\\nover whom she had any influence, cast him off likewise.\\nsurely, after doing so, she cannot be imagined liable\\nto any impression of sorrow or of joy on his account--\\nshe cannot be interested in any thing that befalls him.--\\nshe would not be so weak as to throw away the comfort\\nof a child, and yet retain the anxiety of a parent!\"\\n\\n\"ah! elinor,\" said john, \"your reasoning is very good,\\nbut it is founded on ignorance of human nature.\\nwhen edward\\'s unhappy match takes place, depend upon it\\nhis mother will feel as much as if she had never discarded him;\\nand, therefore every circumstance that may accelerate that\\ndreadful event, must be concealed from her as much as possible.\\nmrs. ferrars can never forget that edward is her son.\"\\n\\n\"you surprise me; i should think it must nearly\\nhave escaped her memory by this time.\"\\n\\n\"you wrong her exceedingly.  mrs. ferrars is one\\nof the most affectionate mothers in the world.\"\\n\\nelinor was silent.\\n\\n\"we think now,\"--said mr. dashwood, after a short pause,\\n\"of robert\\'s marrying miss morton.\"\\n\\nelinor, smiling at the grave and decisive importance\\nof her brother\\'s tone, calmly replied,\\n\\n\"the lady, i suppose, has no choice in the affair.\"\\n\\n\"choice!--how do you mean?\"\\n\\n\"i only mean that i suppose, from your manner\\nof speaking, it must be the same to miss morton whether\\nshe marry edward or robert.\"\\n\\n\"certainly, there can be no difference; for robert\\nwill now to all intents and purposes be considered\\nas the eldest son;--and as to any thing else, they are\\nboth very agreeable young men: i do not know that one\\nis superior to the other.\"\\n\\nelinor said no more, and john was also for a short\\ntime silent.--his reflections ended thus.\\n\\n\"of one thing, my dear sister,\" kindly taking her hand,\\nand speaking in an awful whisper,--\"i may assure you;--\\nand i will do it, because i know it must gratify you.\\ni have good reason to think--indeed i have it from the\\nbest authority, or i should not repeat it, for otherwise\\nit would be very wrong to say any thing about it--but\\ni have it from the very best authority--not that i ever\\nprecisely heard mrs. ferrars say it herself--but her\\ndaughter did, and i have it from her--that in short,\\nwhatever objections there might be against a certain--a\\ncertain connection--you understand me--it would have been\\nfar preferable to her, it would not have given her half\\nthe vexation that this does.  i was exceedingly pleased\\nto hear that mrs. ferrars considered it in that light--\\na very gratifying circumstance you know to us all.\\n\\'it would have been beyond comparison,\\' she said, \\'the least\\nevil of the two, and she would be glad to compound now\\nfor nothing worse.\\' but however, all that is quite out\\nof the question--not to be thought of or mentioned--\\nas to any attachment you know--it never could be--all\\nthat is gone by.  but i thought i would just tell you\\nof this, because i knew how much it must please you.\\nnot that you have any reason to regret, my dear elinor.  there\\nis no doubt of your doing exceedingly well--quite as well,\\nor better, perhaps, all things considered.  has colonel\\nbrandon been with you lately?\"\\n\\nelinor had heard enough, if not to gratify her vanity,\\nand raise her self-importance, to agitate her nerves\\nand fill her mind;--and she was therefore glad to be\\nspared from the necessity of saying much in reply herself,\\nand from the danger of hearing any thing more from\\nher brother, by the entrance of mr. robert ferrars.\\nafter a few moments\\' chat, john dashwood, recollecting that\\nfanny was yet uninformed of her sister\\'s being there,\\nquitted the room in quest of her; and elinor was left\\nto improve her acquaintance with robert, who, by the\\ngay unconcern, the happy self-complacency of his manner\\nwhile enjoying so unfair a division of his mother\\'s love\\nand liberality, to the prejudice of his banished brother,\\nearned only by his own dissipated course of life, and that\\nbrother\\'s integrity, was confirming her most unfavourable\\nopinion of his head and heart.\\n\\nthey had scarcely been two minutes by themselves,\\nbefore he began to speak of edward; for he, too, had heard\\nof the living, and was very inquisitive on the subject.\\nelinor repeated the particulars of it, as she had given them\\nto john; and their effect on robert, though very different,\\nwas not less striking than it had been on him.  he laughed\\nmost immoderately.  the idea of edward\\'s being a clergyman,\\nand living in a small parsonage-house, diverted him\\nbeyond measure;--and when to that was added the fanciful\\nimagery of edward reading prayers in a white surplice,\\nand publishing the banns of marriage between john smith and\\nmary brown, he could conceive nothing more ridiculous.\\n\\nelinor, while she waited in silence and immovable\\ngravity, the conclusion of such folly, could not restrain\\nher eyes from being fixed on him with a look that spoke\\nall the contempt it excited.  it was a look, however,\\nvery well bestowed, for it relieved her own feelings, and gave\\nno intelligence to him.  he was recalled from wit to wisdom,\\nnot by any reproof of her\\'s, but by his own sensibility.\\n\\n\"we may treat it as a joke,\" said he, at last,\\nrecovering from the affected laugh which had considerably\\nlengthened out the genuine gaiety of the moment--\"but, upon\\nmy soul, it is a most serious business.  poor edward!\\nhe is ruined for ever.  i am extremely sorry for it--\\nfor i know him to be a very good-hearted creature; as\\nwell-meaning a fellow perhaps, as any in the world.\\nyou must not judge of him, miss dashwood, from your\\nslight acquaintance.--poor edward!--his manners are certainly\\nnot the happiest in nature.--but we are not all born,\\nyou know, with the same powers,--the same address.--\\npoor fellow!--to see him in a circle of strangers!--\\nto be sure it was pitiable enough!--but upon my soul,\\ni believe he has as good a heart as any in the kingdom;\\nand i declare and protest to you i never was so shocked in my\\nlife, as when it all burst forth.  i could not believe it.--\\nmy mother was the first person who told me of it;\\nand i, feeling myself called on to act with resolution,\\nimmediately said to her, \\'my dear madam, i do not know\\nwhat you may intend to do on the occasion, but as for myself,\\ni must say, that if edward does marry this young woman,\\ni never will see him again.\\' that was what i said immediately.--\\ni was most uncommonly shocked, indeed!--poor edward!--he has\\ndone for himself completely--shut himself out for ever from\\nall decent society!--but, as i directly said to my mother,\\ni am not in the least surprised at it; from his style\\nof education, it was always to be expected.  my poor mother\\nwas half frantic.\"\\n\\n\"have you ever seen the lady?\"\\n\\n\"yes; once, while she was staying in this house,\\ni happened to drop in for ten minutes; and i saw\\nquite enough of her.  the merest awkward country girl,\\nwithout style, or elegance, and almost without beauty.--\\ni remember her perfectly.  just the kind of girl i\\nshould suppose likely to captivate poor edward.\\ni offered immediately, as soon as my mother related\\nthe affair to me, to talk to him myself, and dissuade\\nhim from the match; but it was too late then, i found,\\nto do any thing, for unluckily, i was not in the way\\nat first, and knew nothing of it till after the breach\\nhad taken place, when it was not for me, you know,\\nto interfere.  but had i been informed of it a few\\nhours earlier--i think it is most probable--that something\\nmight have been hit on.  i certainly should have represented\\nit to edward in a very strong light.  \\'my dear fellow,\\'\\ni should have said, \\'consider what you are doing.\\nyou are making a most disgraceful connection, and such a one\\nas your family are unanimous in disapproving.\\' i cannot\\nhelp thinking, in short, that means might have been found.\\nbut now it is all too late.  he must be starved, you know;--\\nthat is certain; absolutely starved.\"\\n\\nhe had just settled this point with great composure,\\nwhen the entrance of mrs. john dashwood put an end to the\\nsubject.\\nbut though she never spoke of it out of her own family,\\nelinor could see its influence on her mind, in the something\\nlike confusion of countenance with which she entered,\\nand an attempt at cordiality in her behaviour to herself.\\nshe even proceeded so far as to be concerned to find\\nthat elinor and her sister were so soon to leave town,\\nas she had hoped to see more of them;--an exertion\\nin which her husband, who attended her into the room,\\nand hung enamoured over her accents, seemed to distinguish\\nevery thing that was most affectionate and graceful.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 42\\n\\n\\none other short call in harley street, in which elinor\\nreceived her brother\\'s congratulations on their travelling\\nso far towards barton without any expense, and on colonel\\nbrandon\\'s being to follow them to cleveland in a day or two,\\ncompleted the intercourse of the brother and sisters\\nin town;--and a faint invitation from fanny, to come\\nto norland whenever it should happen to be in their way,\\nwhich of all things was the most unlikely to occur,\\nwith a more warm, though less public, assurance, from john\\nto elinor, of the promptitude with which he should come\\nto see her at delaford, was all that foretold any meeting\\nin the country.\\n\\nit amused her to observe that all her friends seemed\\ndetermined to send her to delaford;--a place, in which,\\nof all others, she would now least chuse to visit,\\nor wish to reside; for not only was it considered as\\nher future home by her brother and mrs. jennings, but even lucy,\\nwhen they parted, gave her a pressing invitation to visit her there.\\n\\nvery early in april, and tolerably early in the day,\\nthe two parties from hanover square and berkeley street set\\nout from their respective homes, to meet, by appointment,\\non the road.  for the convenience of charlotte and her child,\\nthey were to be more than two days on their journey,\\nand mr. palmer, travelling more expeditiously with colonel brandon,\\nwas to join them at cleveland soon after their arrival.\\n\\nmarianne, few as had been her hours of comfort\\nin london, and eager as she had long been to quit it,\\ncould not, when it came to the point, bid adieu to\\nthe house in which she had for the last time enjoyed\\nthose hopes, and that confidence, in willoughby,\\nwhich were now extinguished for ever, without great pain.\\nnor could she leave the place in which willoughby remained,\\nbusy in new engagements, and new schemes, in which she\\ncould have no share, without shedding many tears.\\n\\nelinor\\'s satisfaction, at the moment of removal,\\nwas more positive.  she had no such object for her lingering\\nthoughts to fix on, she left no creature behind, from whom\\nit would give her a moment\\'s regret to be divided for ever,\\nshe was pleased to be free herself from the persecution\\nof lucy\\'s friendship, she was grateful for bringing\\nher sister away unseen by willoughby since his marriage,\\nand she looked forward with hope to what a few months\\nof tranquility at barton might do towards restoring\\nmarianne\\'s peace of mind, and confirming her own.\\n\\ntheir journey was safely performed.  the second\\nday brought them into the cherished, or the prohibited,\\ncounty of somerset, for as such was it dwelt on by turns\\nin marianne\\'s imagination; and in the forenoon of the third\\nthey drove up to cleveland.\\n\\ncleveland was a spacious, modern-built house,\\nsituated on a sloping lawn.  it had no park, but the\\npleasure-grounds were tolerably extensive; and like\\nevery other place of the same degree of importance,\\nit had its open shrubbery, and closer wood walk,\\na road of smooth gravel winding round a plantation,\\nled to the front, the lawn was dotted over with timber,\\nthe house itself was under the guardianship of the fir,\\nthe mountain-ash, and the acacia, and a thick screen of\\nthem altogether, interspersed with tall lombardy poplars,\\nshut out the offices.\\n\\nmarianne entered the house with a heart swelling\\nwith emotion from the consciousness of being only eighty\\nmiles from barton, and not thirty from combe magna;\\nand before she had been five minutes within its walls,\\nwhile the others were busily helping charlotte to show\\nher child to the housekeeper, she quitted it again,\\nstealing away through the winding shrubberies, now just\\nbeginning to be in beauty, to gain a distant eminence;\\nwhere, from its grecian temple, her eye, wandering over\\na wide tract of country to the south-east, could fondly\\nrest on the farthest ridge of hills in the horizon,\\nand fancy that from their summits combe magna might be seen.\\n\\nin such moments of precious, invaluable misery,\\nshe rejoiced in tears of agony to be at cleveland;\\nand as she returned by a different circuit to the house,\\nfeeling all the happy privilege of country liberty,\\nof wandering from place to place in free and luxurious solitude,\\nshe resolved to spend almost every hour of every day\\nwhile she remained with the palmers, in the indulgence of\\nsuch solitary rambles.\\n\\nshe returned just in time to join the others\\nas they quitted the house, on an excursion through its\\nmore immediate premises; and the rest of the morning was\\neasily whiled away, in lounging round the kitchen garden,\\nexamining the bloom upon its walls, and listening to the\\ngardener\\'s lamentations upon blights, in dawdling through\\nthe green-house, where the loss of her favourite plants,\\nunwarily exposed, and nipped by the lingering frost,\\nraised the laughter of charlotte,--and in visiting her\\npoultry-yard, where, in the disappointed hopes of her\\ndairy-maid, by hens forsaking their nests, or being\\nstolen by a fox, or in the rapid decrease of a promising\\nyoung brood, she found fresh sources of merriment.\\n\\nthe morning was fine and dry, and marianne,\\nin her plan of employment abroad, had not calculated\\nfor any change of weather during their stay at cleveland.\\nwith great surprise therefore, did she find herself prevented\\nby a settled rain from going out again after dinner.\\nshe had depended on a twilight walk to the grecian temple,\\nand perhaps all over the grounds, and an evening merely\\ncold or damp would not have deterred her from it;\\nbut a heavy and settled rain even she could not fancy dry\\nor pleasant weather for walking.\\n\\ntheir party was small, and the hours passed quietly away.\\nmrs. palmer had her child, and mrs. jennings her carpet-work;\\nthey talked of the friends they had left behind,\\narranged lady middleton\\'s engagements, and wondered\\nwhether mr. palmer and colonel brandon would get farther\\nthan reading that night.  elinor, however little concerned\\nin it, joined in their discourse; and marianne, who had\\nthe knack of finding her way in every house to the library,\\nhowever it might be avoided by the family in general,\\nsoon procured herself a book.\\n\\nnothing was wanting on mrs. palmer\\'s side that constant\\nand friendly good humour could do, to make them feel\\nthemselves welcome.  the openness and heartiness of her\\nmanner more than atoned for that want of recollection\\nand elegance which made her often deficient in the forms\\nof politeness; her kindness, recommended by so pretty\\na face, was engaging; her folly, though evident\\nwas not disgusting, because it was not conceited;\\nand elinor could have forgiven every thing but her laugh.\\n\\nthe two gentlemen arrived the next day to a very\\nlate dinner, affording a pleasant enlargement of the party,\\nand a very welcome variety to their conversation, which a\\nlong morning of the same continued rain had reduced very low.\\n\\nelinor had seen so little of mr. palmer, and in that\\nlittle had seen so much variety in his address to her\\nsister and herself, that she knew not what to expect\\nto find him in his own family.  she found him, however,\\nperfectly the gentleman in his behaviour to all his visitors,\\nand only occasionally rude to his wife and her mother;\\nshe found him very capable of being a pleasant companion,\\nand only prevented from being so always, by too great\\nan aptitude to fancy himself as much superior to people\\nin general, as he must feel himself to be to mrs. jennings\\nand charlotte.  for the rest of his character and habits,\\nthey were marked, as far as elinor could perceive,\\nwith no traits at all unusual in his sex and time of life.\\nhe was nice in his eating, uncertain in his hours;\\nfond of his child, though affecting to slight it;\\nand idled away the mornings at billiards, which ought\\nto have been devoted to business.  she liked him, however,\\nupon the whole, much better than she had expected, and in\\nher heart was not sorry that she could like him no more;--\\nnot sorry to be driven by the observation of his epicurism,\\nhis selfishness, and his conceit, to rest with complacency\\non the remembrance of edward\\'s generous temper, simple taste,\\nand diffident feelings.\\n\\nof edward, or at least of some of his concerns,\\nshe now received intelligence from colonel brandon,\\nwho had been into dorsetshire lately; and who,\\ntreating her at once as the disinterested friend\\nof mr. ferrars, and the kind of confidant of himself,\\ntalked to her a great deal of the parsonage at delaford,\\ndescribed its deficiencies, and told her what he meant\\nto do himself towards removing them.--his behaviour\\nto her in this, as well as in every other particular,\\nhis open pleasure in meeting her after an absence\\nof only ten days, his readiness to converse with her,\\nand his deference for her opinion, might very well\\njustify mrs. jennings\\'s persuasion of his attachment,\\nand would have been enough, perhaps, had not elinor still,\\nas from the first, believed marianne his real favourite,\\nto make her suspect it herself.  but as it was,\\nsuch a notion had scarcely ever entered her head,\\nexcept by mrs. jennings\\'s suggestion; and she could\\nnot help believing herself the nicest observer of the\\ntwo;--she watched his eyes, while mrs. jennings thought\\nonly of his behaviour;--and while his looks of anxious\\nsolicitude on marianne\\'s feeling, in her head and throat,\\nthe beginning of a heavy cold, because unexpressed by words,\\nentirely escaped the latter lady\\'s observation;--she could\\ndiscover in them the quick feelings, and needless alarm\\nof a lover.\\n\\ntwo delighful twilight walks on the third and fourth\\nevenings of her being there, not merely on the dry gravel\\nof the shrubbery, but all over the grounds, and especially\\nin the most distant parts of them, where there was something\\nmore of wildness than in the rest, where the trees were\\nthe oldest, and the grass was the longest and wettest,\\nhad--assisted by the still greater imprudence of sitting\\nin her wet shoes and stockings--given marianne a cold\\nso violent as, though for a day or two trifled with\\nor denied, would force itself by increasing ailments on\\nthe concern of every body, and the notice of herself.\\nprescriptions poured in from all quarters, and as usual,\\nwere all declined.  though heavy and feverish, with a pain\\nin her limbs, and a cough, and a sore throat, a good night\\'s\\nrest was to cure her entirely; and it was with difficulty\\nthat elinor prevailed on her, when she went to bed,\\nto try one or two of the simplest of the remedies.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 43\\n\\n\\nmarianne got up the next morning at her usual time;\\nto every inquiry replied that she was better, and tried to\\nprove herself so, by engaging in her accustomary employments.\\nbut a day spent in sitting shivering over the fire\\nwith a book in her hand, which she was unable to read,\\nor in lying, weary and languid, on a sofa, did not speak\\nmuch in favour of her amendment; and when, at last,\\nshe went early to bed, more and more indisposed, colonel\\nbrandon was only astonished at her sister\\'s composure,\\nwho, though attending and nursing her the whole day,\\nagainst marianne inclination, and forcing proper medicines\\non her at night, trusted, like marianne, to the certainty\\nand efficacy of sleep, and felt no real alarm.\\n\\na very restless and feverish night, however,\\ndisappointed the expectation of both; and when marianne,\\nafter persisting in rising, confessed herself unable\\nto sit up, and returned voluntarily to her bed,\\nelinor was very ready to adopt mrs. jennings\\'s advice,\\nof sending for the palmers\\' apothecary.\\n\\nhe came, examined his patient, and though encouraging\\nmiss dashwood to expect that a very few days would restore\\nher sister to health, yet, by pronouncing her disorder\\nto have a putrid tendency, and allowing the word \"infection\"\\nto pass his lips, gave instant alarm to mrs. palmer,\\non her baby\\'s account.  mrs. jennings, who had been inclined\\nfrom the first to think marianne\\'s complaint more serious\\nthan elinor, now looked very grave on mr. harris\\'s report,\\nand confirming charlotte\\'s fears and caution, urged the\\nnecessity of her immediate removal with her infant;\\nand mr. palmer, though treating their apprehensions as idle,\\nfound the anxiety and importunity of his wife too great\\nto be withstood.  her departure, therefore, was fixed on;\\nand within an hour after mr. harris\\'s arrival, she set off,\\nwith her little boy and his nurse, for the house of a\\nnear relation of mr. palmer\\'s, who lived a few miles\\non the other side of bath; whither her husband promised,\\nat her earnest entreaty, to join her in a day or two;\\nand whither she was almost equally urgent with her\\nmother to accompany her.  mrs. jennings, however, with a\\nkindness of heart which made elinor really love her,\\ndeclared her resolution of not stirring from cleveland\\nas long as marianne remained ill, and of endeavouring,\\nby her own attentive care, to supply to her the place\\nof the mother she had taken her from; and elinor found her\\non every occasion a most willing and active helpmate,\\ndesirous to share in all her fatigues, and often by her\\nbetter experience in nursing, of material use.\\n\\npoor marianne, languid and low from the nature\\nof her malady, and feeling herself universally ill,\\ncould no longer hope that tomorrow would find her recovered;\\nand the idea of what tomorrow would have produced,\\nbut for this unlucky illness, made every ailment severe;\\nfor on that day they were to have begun their journey home;\\nand, attended the whole way by a servant of mrs. jennings,\\nwere to have taken their mother by surprise on the\\nfollowing forenoon.  the little she said was all in\\nlamentation of this inevitable delay; though elinor tried\\nto raise her spirits, and make her believe, as she then\\nreally believed herself, that it would be a very short one.\\n\\nthe next day produced little or no alteration in the\\nstate of the patient; she certainly was not better, and,\\nexcept that there was no amendment, did not appear worse.\\ntheir party was now farther reduced; for mr. palmer,\\nthough very unwilling to go as well from real humanity\\nand good-nature, as from a dislike of appearing to be\\nfrightened away by his wife, was persuaded at last\\nby colonel brandon to perform his promise of following her;\\nand while he was preparing to go, colonel brandon himself,\\nwith a much greater exertion, began to talk of going\\nlikewise.--here, however, the kindness of mrs. jennings\\ninterposed most acceptably; for to send the colonel away\\nwhile his love was in so much uneasiness on her sister\\'s\\naccount, would be to deprive them both, she thought,\\nof every comfort; and therefore telling him at once\\nthat his stay at cleveland was necessary to herself,\\nthat she should want him to play at piquet of an evening,\\nwhile miss dashwood was above with her sister, &c. she\\nurged him so strongly to remain, that he, who was gratifying\\nthe first wish of his own heart by a compliance, could not\\nlong even affect to demur; especially as mrs. jennings\\'s\\nentreaty was warmly seconded by mr. palmer, who seemed\\nto feel a relief to himself, in leaving behind him a person\\nso well able to assist or advise miss dashwood in any emergence.\\n\\nmarianne was, of course, kept in ignorance of all\\nthese arrangements.  she knew not that she had been\\nthe means of sending the owners of cleveland away,\\nin about seven days from the time of their arrival.\\nit gave her no surprise that she saw nothing\\nof mrs. palmer; and as it gave her likewise no concern,\\nshe never mentioned her name.\\n\\ntwo days passed away from the time of mr. palmer\\'s departure,\\nand her situation continued, with little variation,\\nthe same.  mr. harris, who attended her every day,\\nstill talked boldly of a speedy recovery, and miss dashwood\\nwas equally sanguine; but the expectation of the others\\nwas by no means so cheerful.  mrs. jennings had determined\\nvery early in the seizure that marianne would never\\nget over it, and colonel brandon, who was chiefly\\nof use in listening to mrs. jennings\\'s forebodings,\\nwas not in a state of mind to resist their influence.\\nhe tried to reason himself out of fears, which the different\\njudgment of the apothecary seemed to render absurd;\\nbut the many hours of each day in which he was left\\nentirely alone, were but too favourable for the admission\\nof every melancholy idea, and he could not expel from\\nhis mind the persuasion that he should see marianne no more.\\n\\non the morning of the third day however, the gloomy\\nanticipations of both were almost done away; for when\\nmr. harris arrived, he declared his patient materially better.\\nher pulse was much stronger, and every symptom more favourable\\nthan on the preceding visit.  elinor, confirmed in every\\npleasant hope, was all cheerfulness; rejoicing that\\nin her letters to her mother, she had pursued her own\\njudgment rather than her friend\\'s, in making very light\\nof the indisposition which delayed them at cleveland;\\nand almost fixing on the time when marianne would be\\nable to travel.\\n\\nbut the day did not close so auspiciously as it began.--\\ntowards the evening marianne became ill again, growing\\nmore heavy, restless, and uncomfortable than before.\\nher sister, however, still sanguine, was willing to\\nattribute the change to nothing more than the fatigue\\nof having sat up to have her bed made; and carefully\\nadministering the cordials prescribed, saw her, with\\nsatisfaction, sink at last into a slumber, from which\\nshe expected the most beneficial effects.  her sleep,\\nthough not so quiet as elinor wished to see it,\\nlasted a considerable time; and anxious to observe\\nthe result of it herself, she resolved to sit with her\\nduring the whole of it.  mrs. jennings, knowing nothing\\nof any change in the patient, went unusually early to bed;\\nher maid, who was one of the principal nurses, was recreating\\nherself in the housekeeper\\'s room, and elinor remained\\nalone with marianne.\\n\\nthe repose of the latter became more and more disturbed;\\nand her sister, who watched, with unremitting attention\\nher continual change of posture, and heard the frequent\\nbut inarticulate sounds of complaint which passed her lips,\\nwas almost wishing to rouse her from so painful a slumber,\\nwhen marianne, suddenly awakened by some accidental noise\\nin the house, started hastily up, and, with feverish wildness,\\ncried out,--\\n\\n\"is mama coming?--\"\\n\\n\"not yet,\" cried the other, concealing her terror,\\nand assisting marianne to lie down again, \"but she will\\nbe here, i hope, before it is long.  it is a great way,\\nyou know, from hence to barton.\"\\n\\n\"but she must not go round by london,\" cried marianne,\\nin the same hurried manner.  \"i shall never see her,\\nif she goes by london.\"\\n\\nelinor perceived with alarm that she was not\\nquite herself, and, while attempting to soothe her,\\neagerly felt her pulse.  it was lower and quicker than ever!\\nand marianne, still talking wildly of mama, her alarm\\nincreased so rapidly, as to determine her on sending\\ninstantly for mr. harris, and despatching a messenger\\nto barton for her mother.  to consult with colonel brandon\\non the best means of effecting the latter, was a thought\\nwhich immediately followed the resolution of its performance;\\nand as soon she had rung up the maid to take her place\\nby her sister, she hastened down to the drawing-room,\\nwhere she knew he was generally to be found at a much\\nlater hour than the present.\\n\\nit was no time for hesitation.  her fears and her\\ndifficulties were immediately before him.  her fears,\\nhe had no courage, no confidence to attempt the removal of:--\\nhe listened to them in silent despondence;--but her\\ndifficulties were instantly obviated, for with a readiness\\nthat seemed to speak the occasion, and the service\\npre-arranged in his mind, he offered himself as the\\nmessenger who should fetch mrs. dashwood.  elinor made no\\nresistance that was not easily overcome.  she thanked him\\nwith brief, though fervent gratitude, and while he went\\nto hurry off his servant with a message to mr. harris, and\\nan order for post-horses directly, she wrote a few lines\\nto her mother.\\n\\nthe comfort of such a friend at that moment as colonel\\nbrandon--or such a companion for her mother,--how gratefully\\nwas it felt!--a companion whose judgment would guide,\\nwhose attendance must relieve, and whose friendship might\\nsoothe her!--as far as the shock of such a summons could\\nbe lessened to her, his presence, his manners, his assistance,\\nwould lessen it.\\n\\nhe, meanwhile, whatever he might feel, acted with all\\nthe firmness of a collected mind, made every necessary\\narrangement with the utmost despatch, and calculated\\nwith exactness the time in which she might look for\\nhis return.  not a moment was lost in delay of any kind.\\nthe horses arrived, even before they were expected,\\nand colonel brandon only pressing her hand with a look\\nof solemnity, and a few words spoken too low to reach her ear,\\nhurried into the carriage.  it was then about twelve\\no\\'clock, and she returned to her sister\\'s apartment to wait\\nfor the arrival of the apothecary, and to watch by her\\nthe rest of the night.  it was a night of almost equal\\nsuffering to both.  hour after hour passed away in sleepless\\npain and delirium on marianne\\'s side, and in the most\\ncruel anxiety on elinor\\'s, before mr. harris appeared.\\nher apprehensions once raised, paid by their excess for all\\nher former security; and the servant who sat up with her,\\nfor she would not allow mrs. jennings to be called,\\nonly tortured her more, by hints of what her mistress\\nhad always thought.\\n\\nmarianne\\'s ideas were still, at intervals,\\nfixed incoherently on her mother, and whenever she\\nmentioned her name, it gave a pang to the heart of\\npoor elinor, who, reproaching herself for having trifled\\nwith so many days of illness, and wretched for some\\nimmediate relief, fancied that all relief might soon\\nbe in vain, that every thing had been delayed too long,\\nand pictured to herself her suffering mother arriving\\ntoo late to see this darling child, or to see her rational.\\n\\nshe was on the point of sending again for mr. harris,\\nor if he could not come, for some other advice,\\nwhen the former--but not till after five o\\'clock--arrived.\\nhis opinion, however, made some little amends for his delay,\\nfor though acknowledging a very unexpected and unpleasant\\nalteration in his patient, he would not allow the danger\\nto be material, and talked of the relief which a fresh\\nmode of treatment must procure, with a confidence which,\\nin a lesser degree, was communicated to elinor.  he promised\\nto call again in the course of three or four hours,\\nand left both the patient and her anxious attendant more\\ncomposed than he had found them.\\n\\nwith strong concern, and with many reproaches for not\\nbeing called to their aid, did mrs. jennings hear in the\\nmorning of what had passed.  her former apprehensions,\\nnow with greater reason restored, left her no doubt of\\nthe event; and though trying to speak comfort to elinor,\\nher conviction of her sister\\'s danger would not allow her\\nto offer the comfort of hope.  her heart was really grieved.\\nthe rapid decay, the early death of a girl so young,\\nso lovely as marianne, must have struck a less interested\\nperson with concern.  on mrs. jennings\\'s compassion\\nshe had other claims.  she had been for three months\\nher companion, was still under her care, and she was\\nknown to have been greatly injured, and long unhappy.\\nthe distress of her sister too, particularly a favourite,\\nwas before her;--and as for their mother, when mrs. jennings\\nconsidered that marianne might probably be to her what\\ncharlotte was to herself, her sympathy in her sufferings\\nwas very sincere.\\n\\nmr. harris was punctual in his second visit;--\\nbut he came to be disappointed in his hopes of what the\\nlast would produce.  his medicines had failed;--the fever\\nwas unabated; and marianne only more quiet--not more\\nherself--remained in a heavy stupor.  elinor, catching all,\\nand more than all, his fears in a moment, proposed to call\\nin further advice.  but he judged it unnecessary: he had\\nstill something more to try, some more fresh application,\\nof whose success he was as confident as the last, and his\\nvisit concluded with encouraging assurances which reached\\nthe ear, but could not enter the heart of miss dashwood.\\nshe was calm, except when she thought of her mother;\\nbut she was almost hopeless; and in this state she continued\\ntill noon, scarcely stirring from her sister\\'s bed,\\nher thoughts wandering from one image of grief,\\none suffering friend to another, and her spirits oppressed\\nto the utmost by the conversation of mrs. jennings,\\nwho scrupled not to attribute the severity and danger\\nof this attack to the many weeks of previous indisposition\\nwhich marianne\\'s disappointment had brought on.\\nelinor felt all the reasonableness of the idea, and it\\ngave fresh misery to her reflections.\\n\\nabout noon, however, she began--but with a caution--a\\ndread of disappointment which for some time kept her silent,\\neven to her friend--to fancy, to hope she could perceive\\na slight amendment in her sister\\'s pulse;--she waited,\\nwatched, and examined it again and again;--and at last,\\nwith an agitation more difficult to bury under exterior calmness,\\nthan all her foregoing distress, ventured to communicate\\nher hopes.  mrs. jennings, though forced, on examination,\\nto acknowledge a temporary revival, tried to keep her\\nyoung friend from indulging a thought of its continuance;--\\nand elinor, conning over every injunction of distrust,\\ntold herself likewise not to hope.  but it was too late.\\nhope had already entered; and feeling all its anxious flutter,\\nshe bent over her sister to watch--she hardly knew for what.\\nhalf an hour passed away, and the favourable symptom\\nyet blessed her.  others even arose to confirm it.\\nher breath, her skin, her lips, all flattered elinor\\nwith signs of amendment; and marianne fixed her eyes on\\nher with a rational, though languid, gaze.  anxiety and\\nhope now oppressed her in equal degrees, and left her no\\nmoment of tranquillity till the arrival of mr. harris at\\nfour o\\'clock;--when his assurances, his felicitations on\\na recovery in her sister even surpassing his expectation,\\ngave her confidence, comfort, and tears of joy.\\n\\nmarianne was in every respect materially better,\\nand he declared her entirely out of danger.  mrs. jennings,\\nperhaps satisfied with the partial justification of her\\nforebodings which had been found in their late alarm,\\nallowed herself to trust in his judgment, and admitted,\\nwith unfeigned joy, and soon with unequivocal cheerfulness,\\nthe probability of an entire recovery.\\n\\nelinor could not be cheerful.  her joy was of a\\ndifferent kind, and led to any thing rather than to gaiety.\\nmarianne restored to life, health, friends, and to her\\ndoting mother, was an idea to fill her heart with sensations\\nof exquisite comfort, and expand it in fervent gratitude;--\\nbut it lead to no outward demonstrations of joy, no words,\\nno smiles.  all within elinor\\'s breast was satisfaction,\\nsilent and strong.\\n\\nshe continued by the side of her sister, with little\\nintermission the whole afternoon, calming every fear,\\nsatisfying every inquiry of her enfeebled spirits,\\nsupplying every succour, and watching almost every look and\\nevery breath.  the possibility of a relapse would of course,\\nin some moments, occur to remind her of what anxiety was--\\nbut when she saw, on her frequent and minute examination,\\nthat every symptom of recovery continued, and saw marianne\\nat six o\\'clock sink into a quiet, steady, and to all\\nappearance comfortable, sleep, she silenced every doubt.\\n\\nthe time was now drawing on, when colonel brandon\\nmight be expected back.  at ten o\\'clock, she trusted,\\nor at least not much later her mother would be relieved\\nfrom the dreadful suspense in which she must now be\\ntravelling towards them.  the colonel, too!--perhaps scarcely\\nless an object of pity!--oh!--how slow was the progress\\nof time which yet kept them in ignorance!\\n\\nat seven o\\'clock, leaving marianne still sweetly asleep,\\nshe joined mrs. jennings in the drawing-room to tea.\\nof breakfast she had been kept by her fears, and of\\ndinner by their sudden reverse, from eating much;--\\nand the present refreshment, therefore, with such feelings\\nof content as she brought to it, was particularly welcome.\\nmrs. jennings would have persuaded her, at its conclusion,\\nto take some rest before her mother\\'s arrival, and allow her to\\ntake her place by marianne; but elinor had no sense of fatigue,\\nno capability of sleep at that moment about her, and she was\\nnot to be kept away from her sister an unnecessary instant.\\nmrs. jennings therefore attending her up stairs into the\\nsick chamber, to satisfy herself that all continued right,\\nleft her there again to her charge and her thoughts,\\nand retired to her own room to write letters and sleep.\\n\\nthe night was cold and stormy.  the wind roared\\nround the house, and the rain beat against the windows;\\nbut elinor, all happiness within, regarded it not.\\nmarianne slept through every blast; and the travellers--\\nthey had a rich reward in store, for every present inconvenience.\\n\\nthe clock struck eight.  had it been ten,\\nelinor would have been convinced that at that moment\\nshe heard a carriage driving up to the house;\\nand so strong was the persuasion that she did, in spite\\nof the almost impossibility of their being already come,\\nthat she moved into the adjoining dressing-closet and\\nopened a window shutter, to be satisfied of the truth.\\nshe instantly saw that her ears had not deceived her.\\nthe flaring lamps of a carriage were immediately in view.\\nby their uncertain light she thought she could discern it\\nto be drawn by four horses; and this, while it told the\\nexcess of her poor mother\\'s alarm, gave some explanation\\nto such unexpected rapidity.\\n\\nnever in her life had elinor found it so difficult\\nto be calm, as at that moment.  the knowledge of what her\\nmother must be feeling as the carriage stopt at the door--\\nof her doubt--her dread--perhaps her despair!--and\\nof what she had to tell!--with such knowledge it was\\nimpossible to be calm.  all that remained to be done\\nwas to be speedy; and, therefore staying only till\\nshe could leave mrs. jennings\\'s maid with her sister,\\nshe hurried down stairs.\\n\\nthe bustle in the vestibule, as she passed along\\nan inner lobby, assured her that they were already\\nin the house.  she rushed to the drawing-room,--she\\nentered it,--and saw only willoughby.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 44\\n\\n\\nelinor, starting back with a look of horror at\\nthe sight of him, obeyed the first impulse of her heart\\nin turning instantly to quit the room, and her hand\\nwas already on the lock, when its action was suspended\\nby his hastily advancing, and saying, in a voice rather\\nof command than supplication,\\n\\n\"miss dashwood, for half an hour--for ten minutes--\\ni entreat you to stay.\"\\n\\n\"no, sir,\" she replied with firmness, \"i shall not stay.\\nyour business cannot be with me.  the servants, i suppose,\\nforgot to tell you that mr. palmer was not in the house.\"\\n\\n\"had they told me,\" he cried with vehemence,\\n\"that mr. palmer and all his relations were at the devil,\\nit would not have turned me from the door.  my business\\nis with you, and only you.\"\\n\\n\"with me!\"--in the utmost amazement--\"well, sir,--\\nbe quick--and if you can--less violent.\"\\n\\n\"sit down, and i will be both.\"\\n\\nshe hesitated; she knew not what to do.  the possibility\\nof colonel brandon\\'s arriving and finding her there,\\ncame across her.  but she had promised to hear him,\\nand her curiosity no less than her honor was engaged.\\nafter a moment\\'s recollection, therefore, concluding that\\nprudence required dispatch, and that her acquiescence would\\nbest promote it, she walked silently towards the table,\\nand sat down.  he took the opposite chair, and for half\\na minute not a word was said by either.\\n\\n\"pray be quick, sir,\"--said elinor, impatiently;--\\n\"i have no time to spare.\"\\n\\nhe was sitting in an attitude of deep meditation,\\nand seemed not to hear her.\\n\\n\"your sister,\" said he, with abruptness, a moment\\nafterwards--\"is out of danger.  i heard it from the servant.\\ngod be praised!--but is it true? is it really true?\"\\n\\nelinor would not speak.  he repeated the inquiry with\\nyet greater eagerness.\\n\\n\"for god\\'s sake tell me, is she out of danger, or is she not?\"\\n\\n\"we hope she is.\"\\n\\nhe rose up, and walked across the room.\\n\\n\"had i known as much half an hour ago--but\\nsince i am here,\"--speaking with a forced vivacity as he\\nreturned to his seat--\"what does it signify?--for once,\\nmiss dashwood--it will be the last time, perhaps--let us\\nbe cheerful together.--i am in a fine mood for gaiety.--\\ntell me honestly\"--a deeper glow overspreading his cheeks--\\n\"do you think me most a knave or a fool?\"\\n\\nelinor looked at him with greater astonishment than ever.\\nshe began to think that be must be in liquor;--the\\nstrangeness of such a visit, and of such manners,\\nseemed no otherwise intelligible; and with this impression\\nshe immediately rose, saying,\\n\\n\"mr. willoughby, i advise you at present to return\\nto combe--i am not at leisure to remain with you longer.--\\nwhatever your business may be with me, will it be better\\nrecollected and explained to-morrow.\"\\n\\n\"i understand you,\" he replied, with an expressive smile,\\nand a voice perfectly calm; \"yes, i am very drunk.--\\na pint of porter with my cold beef at marlborough was\\nenough to over-set me.\"\\n\\n\"at marlborough!\"--cried elinor, more and more at\\na loss to understand what he would be at.\\n\\n\"yes,--i left london this morning at eight o\\'clock,\\nand the only ten minutes i have spent out of my chaise\\nsince that time procured me a nuncheon at marlborough.\"\\n\\nthe steadiness of his manner, and the intelligence\\nof his eye as he spoke, convincing elinor, that whatever\\nother unpardonable folly might bring him to cleveland,\\nhe was not brought there by intoxication, she said,\\nafter a moment\\'s recollection,\\n\\n\"mr. willoughby, you ought to feel, and i certainly\\ndo--that after what has passed--your coming here in\\nthis manner, and forcing yourself upon my notice,\\nrequires a very particular excuse.--what is it,\\nthat you mean by it?\"--\\n\\n\"i mean,\"--said he, with serious energy--\"if i can,\\nto make you hate me one degree less than you do now.\\ni mean to offer some kind of explanation, some kind\\nof apology, for the past; to open my whole heart to you,\\nand by convincing you, that though i have been always\\na blockhead, i have not been always a rascal, to obtain\\nsomething like forgiveness from ma--from your sister.\"\\n\\n\"is this the real reason of your coming?\"\\n\\n\"upon my soul it is,\"--was his answer, with a warmth\\nwhich brought all the former willoughby to her remembrance,\\nand in spite of herself made her think him sincere.\\n\\n\"if that is all, you may be satisfied already,--\\nfor marianne does--she has long forgiven you.\"\\n\\n\"has she?\"--he cried, in the same eager tone.--\\n\"then she has forgiven me before she ought to have done it.\\nbut she shall forgive me again, and on more reasonable\\ngrounds.--now will you listen to me?\"\\n\\nelinor bowed her assent.\\n\\n\"i do not know,\" said he, after a pause of expectation\\non her side, and thoughtfulness on his own,--\"how you\\nmay have accounted for my behaviour to your sister,\\nor what diabolical motive you may have imputed to me.--\\nperhaps you will hardly think the better of me,--it is\\nworth the trial however, and you shall hear every thing.\\nwhen i first became intimate in your family, i had no\\nother intention, no other view in the acquaintance\\nthan to pass my time pleasantly while i was obliged to remain\\nin devonshire, more pleasantly than i had ever done before.\\nyour sister\\'s lovely person and interesting manners\\ncould not but please me; and her behaviour to me almost\\nfrom the first, was of a kind--it is astonishing,\\nwhen i reflect on what it was, and what she was, that my\\nheart should have been so insensible!  but at first\\ni must confess, my vanity only was elevated by it.\\ncareless of her happiness, thinking only of my own amusement,\\ngiving way to feelings which i had always been too much\\nin the habit of indulging, i endeavoured, by every means\\nin my power, to make myself pleasing to her, without any\\ndesign of returning her affection.\"\\n\\nmiss dashwood, at this point, turning her eyes on him\\nwith the most angry contempt, stopped him, by saying,\\n\\n\"it is hardly worth while, mr. willoughby,\\nfor you to relate, or for me to listen any longer.\\nsuch a beginning as this cannot be followed by any thing.--\\ndo not let me be pained by hearing any thing more on\\nthe subject.\"\\n\\n\"i insist on you hearing the whole of it,\" he replied,\\n\"my fortune was never large, and i had always been expensive,\\nalways in the habit of associating with people of better\\nincome than myself.  every year since my coming of age,\\nor even before, i believe, had added to my debts; and though\\nthe death of my old cousin, mrs. smith, was to set me free;\\nyet that event being uncertain, and possibly far distant,\\nit had been for some time my intention to re-establish my\\ncircumstances by marrying a woman of fortune.  to attach\\nmyself to your sister, therefore, was not a thing to be\\nthought of;--and with a meanness, selfishness, cruelty--\\nwhich no indignant, no contemptuous look, even of yours,\\nmiss dashwood, can ever reprobate too much--i was acting\\nin this manner, trying to engage her regard, without a\\nthought of returning it.--but one thing may be said\\nfor me: even in that horrid state of selfish vanity,\\ni did not know the extent of the injury i meditated,\\nbecause i did not then know what it was to love.\\nbut have i ever known it?--well may it be doubted; for, had i\\nreally loved, could i have sacrificed my feelings to vanity,\\nto avarice?--or, what is more, could i have sacrificed hers?--\\nbut i have done it.  to avoid a comparative poverty,\\nwhich her affection and her society would have deprived\\nof all its horrors, i have, by raising myself to affluence,\\nlost every thing that could make it a blessing.\"\\n\\n\"you did then,\" said elinor, a little softened,\\n\"believe yourself at one time attached to her?\"\\n\\n\"to have resisted such attractions, to have withstood\\nsuch tenderness!--is there a man on earth who could have\\ndone it?--yes, i found myself, by insensible degrees,\\nsincerely fond of her; and the happiest hours of my life\\nwere what i spent with her when i felt my intentions\\nwere strictly honourable, and my feelings blameless.\\neven then, however, when fully determined on paying\\nmy addresses to her, i allowed myself most improperly\\nto put off, from day to day, the moment of doing it,\\nfrom an unwillingness to enter into an engagement\\nwhile my circumstances were so greatly embarrassed.\\ni will not reason here--nor will i stop for you to expatiate\\non the absurdity, and the worse than absurdity, of scrupling\\nto engage my faith where my honour was already bound.\\nthe event has proved, that i was a cunning fool,\\nproviding with great circumspection for a possible\\nopportunity of making myself contemptible and wretched\\nfor ever.  at last, however, my resolution was taken,\\nand i had determined, as soon as i could engage her alone,\\nto justify the attentions i had so invariably paid her,\\nand openly assure her of an affection which i had already\\ntaken such pains to display.  but in the interim--in the\\ninterim of the very few hours that were to pass, before i\\ncould have an opportunity of speaking with her in private--\\na circumstance occurred--an unlucky circumstance, to ruin\\nall my resolution, and with it all my comfort.  a discovery\\ntook place,\"--here he hesitated and looked down.--\"mrs. smith\\nhad somehow or other been informed, i imagine by some\\ndistant relation, whose interest it was to deprive me of\\nher favour, of an affair, a connection--but i need not\\nexplain myself farther,\" he added, looking at her with an\\nheightened colour and an enquiring eye--\"your particular\\nintimacy--you have probably heard the whole story long ago.\"\\n\\n\"i have,\" returned elinor, colouring likewise,\\nand hardening her heart anew against any compassion for him,\\n\"i have heard it all.  and how you will explain away any\\npart of your guilt in that dreadful business, i confess\\nis beyond my comprehension.\"\\n\\n\"remember,\" cried willoughby, \"from whom you received\\nthe account.  could it be an impartial one?  i acknowledge\\nthat her situation and her character ought to have been\\nrespected by me.  i do not mean to justify myself, but at\\nthe same time cannot leave you to suppose that i have nothing\\nto urge--that because she was injured she was irreproachable,\\nand because i was a libertine, she must be a saint.\\nif the violence of her passions, the weakness of her\\nunderstanding--i do not mean, however, to defend myself.\\nher affection for me deserved better treatment, and i often,\\nwith great self-reproach, recall the tenderness which,\\nfor a very short time, had the power of creating any return.\\ni wish--i heartily wish it had never been.  but i have injured\\nmore than herself; and i have injured one, whose affection\\nfor me--(may i say it?) was scarcely less warm than hers;\\nand whose mind--oh! how infinitely superior!\"--\\n\\n\"your indifference, however, towards that unfortunate\\ngirl--i must say it, unpleasant to me as the discussion\\nof such a subject may well be--your indifference is no\\napology for your cruel neglect of her.  do not think yourself\\nexcused by any weakness, any natural defect of understanding\\non her side, in the wanton cruelty so evident on yours.\\nyou must have known, that while you were enjoying yourself\\nin devonshire pursuing fresh schemes, always gay,\\nalways happy, she was reduced to the extremest indigence.\"\\n\\n\"but, upon my soul, i did not know it,\" he warmly\\nreplied; \"i did not recollect that i had omitted to give\\nher my direction; and common sense might have told her\\nhow to find it out.\"\\n\\n\"well, sir, and what said mrs. smith?\"\\n\\n\"she taxed me with the offence at once, and my confusion\\nmay be guessed.  the purity of her life, the formality\\nof her notions, her ignorance of the world--every thing\\nwas against me.  the matter itself i could not deny,\\nand vain was every endeavour to soften it.  she was\\npreviously disposed, i believe, to doubt the morality of my\\nconduct in general, and was moreover discontented with\\nthe very little attention, the very little portion of my\\ntime that i had bestowed on her, in my present visit.\\nin short, it ended in a total breach.  by one measure i\\nmight have saved myself.  in the height of her morality,\\ngood woman! she offered to forgive the past, if i would\\nmarry eliza.  that could not be--and i was formally\\ndismissed from her favour and her house.  the night\\nfollowing this affair--i was to go the next morning--\\nwas spent by me in deliberating on what my future conduct\\nshould be.  the struggle was great--but it ended too soon.\\nmy affection for marianne, my thorough conviction of her\\nattachment to me--it was all insufficient to outweigh\\nthat dread of poverty, or get the better of those false\\nideas of the necessity of riches, which i was naturally\\ninclined to feel, and expensive society had increased.\\ni had reason to believe myself secure of my present wife,\\nif i chose to address her, and i persuaded myself to think\\nthat nothing else in common prudence remained for me to do.\\na heavy scene however awaited me, before i could leave\\ndevonshire;--i was engaged to dine with you on that very day;\\nsome apology was therefore necessary for my breaking\\nthis engagement.  but whether i should write this apology,\\nor deliver it in person, was a point of long debate.\\nto see marianne, i felt, would be dreadful, and i even doubted\\nwhether i could see her again, and keep to my resolution.\\nin that point, however, i undervalued my own magnanimity,\\nas the event declared; for i went, i saw her, and saw\\nher miserable, and left her miserable--and left her hoping\\nnever to see her again.\"\\n\\n\"why did you call, mr. willoughby?\" said elinor,\\nreproachfully; \"a note would have answered every purpose.--\\nwhy was it necessary to call?\"\\n\\n\"it was necessary to my own pride.  i could not bear\\nto leave the country in a manner that might lead you,\\nor the rest of the neighbourhood, to suspect any part\\nof what had really passed between mrs. smith and myself--\\nand i resolved therefore on calling at the cottage,\\nin my way to honiton.  the sight of your dear sister,\\nhowever, was really dreadful; and, to heighten the matter,\\ni found her alone.  you were all gone i do not know where.\\ni had left her only the evening before, so fully,\\nso firmly resolved within my self on doing right!\\na few hours were to have engaged her to me for ever;\\nand i remember how happy, how gay were my spirits, as i\\nwalked from the cottage to allenham, satisfied with myself,\\ndelighted with every body!  but in this, our last interview\\nof friendship, i approached her with a sense of guilt\\nthat almost took from me the power of dissembling.\\nher sorrow, her disappointment, her deep regret, when i told\\nher that i was obliged to leave devonshire so immediately--i\\nnever shall forget it--united too with such reliance,\\nsuch confidence in me!--oh, god!--what a hard-hearted\\nrascal i was!\"\\n\\nthey were both silent for a few moments.\\nelinor first spoke.\\n\\n\"did you tell her that you should soon return?\"\\n\\n\"i do not know what i told her,\" he replied, impatiently;\\n\"less than was due to the past, beyond a doubt, and in all\\nlikelihood much more than was justified by the future.\\ni cannot think of it.--it won\\'t do.--then came your dear mother\\nto torture me farther, with all her kindness and confidence.\\nthank heaven! it did torture me.  i was miserable.\\nmiss dashwood, you cannot have an idea of the comfort it\\ngives me to look back on my own misery.  i owe such a grudge\\nto myself for the stupid, rascally folly of my own heart,\\nthat all my past sufferings under it are only triumph and\\nexultation to me now.  well, i went, left all that i loved,\\nand went to those to whom, at best, i was only indifferent.\\nmy journey to town--travelling with my own horses,\\nand therefore so tediously--no creature to speak to--my\\nown reflections so cheerful--when i looked forward\\nevery thing so inviting!--when i looked back at barton,\\nthe picture so soothing!--oh, it was a blessed journey!\"\\n\\nhe stopped.\\n\\n\"well, sir,\" said elinor, who, though pitying him,\\ngrew impatient for his departure, \"and this is all?\"\\n\\n\"ah!--no,--have you forgot what passed in town?--\\nthat infamous letter--did she shew it you?\"\\n\\n\"yes, i saw every note that passed.\"\\n\\n\"when the first of hers reached me (as it immediately did,\\nfor i was in town the whole time,) what i felt is--\\nin the common phrase, not to be expressed; in a more\\nsimple one--perhaps too simple to raise any emotion--\\nmy feelings were very, very painful.--every line, every word\\nwas--in the hackneyed metaphor which their dear writer,\\nwere she here, would forbid--a dagger to my heart.\\nto know that marianne was in town was--in the same language--\\na thunderbolt.--thunderbolts and daggers!--what a reproof\\nwould she have given me!--her taste, her opinions--i believe\\nthey are better known to me than my own,--and i am sure\\nthey are dearer.\"\\n\\nelinor\\'s heart, which had undergone many changes\\nin the course of this extraordinary conversation,\\nwas now softened again;--yet she felt it her duty to check\\nsuch ideas in her companion as the last.\\n\\n\"this is not right, mr. willoughby.--remember that\\nyou are married.  relate only what in your conscience\\nyou think necessary for me to hear.\"\\n\\n\"marianne\\'s note, by assuring me that i was still\\nas dear to her as in former days, that in spite of the many,\\nmany weeks we had been separated, she was as constant\\nin her own feelings, and as full of faith in the constancy\\nof mine as ever, awakened all my remorse.  i say awakened,\\nbecause time and london, business and dissipation,\\nhad in some measure quieted it, and i had been growing\\na fine hardened villain, fancying myself indifferent to her,\\nand chusing to fancy that she too must have become\\nindifferent to me; talking to myself of our past attachment\\nas a mere idle, trifling business, shrugging up my shoulders\\nin proof of its being so, and silencing every reproach,\\novercoming every scruple, by secretly saying now and then,\\n\\'i shall be heartily glad to hear she is well married.\\'--\\nbut this note made me know myself better.  i felt that\\nshe was infinitely dearer to me than any other woman\\nin the world, and that i was using her infamously.\\nbut every thing was then just settled between miss grey\\nand me.  to retreat was impossible.  all that i had to do,\\nwas to avoid you both.  i sent no answer to marianne,\\nintending by that to preserve myself from her farther notice;\\nand for some time i was even determined not to call in\\nberkeley street;--but at last, judging it wiser to affect\\nthe air of a cool, common acquaintance than anything else,\\ni watched you all safely out of the house one morning,\\nand left my name.\"\\n\\n\"watched us out of the house!\"\\n\\n\"even so.  you would be surprised to hear how often\\ni watched you, how often i was on the point of falling\\nin with you.  i have entered many a shop to avoid your sight,\\nas the carriage drove by.  lodging as i did in bond street,\\nthere was hardly a day in which i did not catch a glimpse\\nof one or other of you; and nothing but the most constant\\nwatchfulness on my side, a most invariably prevailing\\ndesire to keep out of your sight, could have separated us\\nso long.  i avoided the middletons as much as possible,\\nas well as everybody else who was likely to prove\\nan acquaintance in common.  not aware of their being\\nin town, however, i blundered on sir john, i believe,\\nthe first day of his coming, and the day after i had called\\nat mrs. jennings\\'s.  he asked me to a party, a dance at his\\nhouse in the evening.--had he not told me as an inducement\\nthat you and your sister were to be there, i should have\\nfelt it too certain a thing, to trust myself near him.\\nthe next morning brought another short note from marianne--\\nstill affectionate, open, artless, confiding--everything\\nthat could make my conduct most hateful.  i could not\\nanswer it.  i tried--but could not frame a sentence.\\nbut i thought of her, i believe, every moment of the day.\\nif you can pity me, miss dashwood, pity my situation as it\\nwas then.  with my head and heart full of your sister,\\ni was forced to play the happy lover to another woman!--those\\nthree or four weeks were worse than all.  well, at last,\\nas i need not tell you, you were forced on me; and what a\\nsweet figure i cut!--what an evening of agony it was!--\\nmarianne, beautiful as an angel on one side, calling me\\nwilloughby in such a tone!--oh, god!--holding out her hand\\nto me, asking me for an explanation, with those bewitching\\neyes fixed in such speaking solicitude on my face!--and\\nsophia, jealous as the devil on the other hand, looking\\nall that was--well, it does not signify; it is over now.--\\nsuch an evening!--i ran away from you all as soon as i could;\\nbut not before i had seen marianne\\'s sweet face as white\\nas death.--that was the last, last look i ever had of her;--\\nthe last manner in which she appeared to me.  it was a horrid\\nsight!--yet when i thought of her to-day as really dying,\\nit was a kind of comfort to me to imagine that i knew\\nexactly how she would appear to those, who saw her last\\nin this world.  she was before me, constantly before me,\\nas i travelled, in the same look and hue.\"\\n\\na short pause of mutual thoughtfulness succeeded.\\nwilloughby first rousing himself, broke it thus:\\n\\n\"well, let me make haste and be gone.  your sister\\nis certainly better, certainly out of danger?\"\\n\\n\"we are assured of it.\"\\n\\n\"your poor mother, too!--doting on marianne.\"\\n\\n\"but the letter, mr. willoughby, your own letter;\\nhave you any thing to say about that?\"\\n\\n\"yes, yes, that in particular.  your sister\\nwrote to me again, you know, the very next morning.\\nyou saw what she said.  i was breakfasting at the\\nellisons,--and her letter, with some others, was brought\\nto me there from my lodgings.  it happened to catch\\nsophia\\'s eye before it caught mine--and its size,\\nthe elegance of the paper, the hand-writing altogether,\\nimmediately gave her a suspicion.  some vague report had\\nreached her before of my attachment to some young lady\\nin devonshire, and what had passed within her observation\\nthe preceding evening had marked who the young lady was,\\nand made her more jealous than ever.  affecting that air\\nof playfulness, therefore, which is delightful in a woman\\none loves, she opened the letter directly, and read\\nits contents.  she was well paid for her impudence.\\nshe read what made her wretched.  her wretchedness i could\\nhave borne, but her passion--her malice--at all events it\\nmust be appeased.  and, in short--what do you think of my\\nwife\\'s style of letter-writing?--delicate--tender--\\ntruly feminine--was it not?\"\\n\\n\"your wife!--the letter was in your own hand-writing.\"\\n\\n\"yes, but i had only the credit of servilely copying\\nsuch sentences as i was ashamed to put my name to.\\nthe original was all her own--her own happy thoughts\\nand gentle diction.  but what could i do!--we were engaged,\\nevery thing in preparation, the day almost fixed--but i am\\ntalking like a fool.  preparation!--day!--in honest words,\\nher money was necessary to me, and in a situation like\\nmine, any thing was to be done to prevent a rupture.\\nand after all, what did it signify to my character\\nin the opinion of marianne and her friends, in what language\\nmy answer was couched?--it must have been only to one end.\\nmy business was to declare myself a scoundrel, and whether\\ni did it with a bow or a bluster was of little importance.--\\n\\'i am ruined for ever in their opinion--\\' said i to\\nmyself--\\'i am shut out for ever from their society,\\nthey already think me an unprincipled fellow, this letter\\nwill only make them think me a blackguard one.\\' such were\\nmy reasonings, as, in a sort of desperate carelessness,\\ni copied my wife\\'s words, and parted with the last relics\\nof marianne.  her three notes--unluckily they were all\\nin my pocketbook, or i should have denied their existence,\\nand hoarded them for ever--i was forced to put them up,\\nand could not even kiss them.  and the lock of hair--that too\\ni had always carried about me in the same pocket-book,\\nwhich was now searched by madam with the most ingratiating\\nvirulence,--the dear lock--all, every memento was torn from me.\"\\n\\n\"you are very wrong, mr. willoughby, very blamable,\"\\nsaid elinor, while her voice, in spite of herself,\\nbetrayed her compassionate emotion; \"you ought not to speak\\nin this way, either of mrs. willoughby or my sister.\\nyou had made your own choice.  it was not forced on you.\\nyour wife has a claim to your politeness, to your respect,\\nat least.  she must be attached to you, or she would not\\nhave married you.  to treat her with unkindness, to speak\\nof her slightingly is no atonement to marianne--nor can i\\nsuppose it a relief to your own conscience.\"\\n\\n\"do not talk to me of my wife,\" said he with a heavy sigh.--\\n\"she does not deserve your compassion.--she knew i had no\\nregard for her when we married.--well, married we were,\\nand came down to combe magna to be happy, and afterwards\\nreturned to town to be gay.--and now do you pity me,\\nmiss dashwood?--or have i said all this to no purpose?--\\nam i--be it only one degree--am i less guilty in your opinion\\nthan i was before?--my intentions were not always wrong.\\nhave i explained away any part of my guilt?\"\\n\\n\"yes, you have certainly removed something--a little.--\\nyou have proved yourself, on the whole, less faulty than\\ni had believed you.  you have proved your heart less wicked,\\nmuch less wicked.  but i hardly know--the misery that\\nyou have inflicted--i hardly know what could have made\\nit worse.\"\\n\\n\"will you repeat to your sister when she is recovered,\\nwhat i have been telling you?--let me be a little lightened\\ntoo in her opinion as well as in yours.  you tell me that\\nshe has forgiven me already.  let me be able to fancy that\\na better knowledge of my heart, and of my present feelings,\\nwill draw from her a more spontaneous, more natural, more\\ngentle, less dignified, forgiveness.  tell her of my misery\\nand my penitence--tell her that my heart was never inconstant\\nto her, and if you will, that at this moment she is dearer\\nto me than ever.\"\\n\\n\"i will tell her all that is necessary to what may\\ncomparatively be called, your justification.  but you have\\nnot explained to me the particular reason of your coming now,\\nnor how you heard of her illness.\"\\n\\n\"last night, in drury lane lobby, i ran against sir\\njohn middleton, and when he saw who i was--for the first\\ntime these two months--he spoke to me.--that he had cut\\nme ever since my marriage, i had seen without surprise\\nor resentment.  now, however, his good-natured, honest,\\nstupid soul, full of indignation against me, and concern\\nfor your sister, could not resist the temptation of telling\\nme what he knew ought to--though probably he did not\\nthink it would--vex me horridly.  as bluntly as he could\\nspeak it, therefore, he told me that marianne dashwood\\nwas dying of a putrid fever at cleveland--a letter that\\nmorning received from mrs. jennings declared her danger\\nmost imminent--the palmers are all gone off in a fright,\\n&c.--i was too much shocked to be able to pass myself\\noff as insensible even to the undiscerning sir john.\\nhis heart was softened in seeing mine suffer; and so much\\nof his ill-will was done away, that when we parted,\\nhe almost shook me by the hand while he reminded me of an\\nold promise about a pointer puppy.  what i felt on hearing\\nthat your sister was dying--and dying too, believing me\\nthe greatest villain upon earth, scorning, hating me\\nin her latest moments--for how could i tell what horrid\\nprojects might not have been imputed?  one person i\\nwas sure would represent me as capable of any thing--\\nwhat i felt was dreadful!--my resolution was soon made,\\nand at eight o\\'clock this morning i was in my carriage.\\nnow you know all.\"\\n\\nelinor made no answer.  her thoughts were silently fixed\\non the irreparable injury which too early an independence\\nand its consequent habits of idleness, dissipation, and luxury,\\nhad made in the mind, the character, the happiness,\\nof a man who, to every advantage of person and talents,\\nunited a disposition naturally open and honest, and a\\nfeeling, affectionate temper.  the world had made him\\nextravagant and vain--extravagance and vanity had made him\\ncold-hearted and selfish.  vanity, while seeking its own\\nguilty triumph at the expense of another, had involved\\nhim in a real attachment, which extravagance, or at least\\nits offspring, necessity, had required to be sacrificed.\\neach faulty propensity in leading him to evil, had led\\nhim likewise to punishment.  the attachment, from which\\nagainst honour, against feeling, against every better interest\\nhe had outwardly torn himself, now, when no longer allowable,\\ngoverned every thought; and the connection, for the sake\\nof which he had, with little scruple, left her sister\\nto misery, was likely to prove a source of unhappiness\\nto himself of a far more incurable nature.  from a reverie\\nof this kind she was recalled at the end of some minutes\\nby willoughby, who, rousing himself from a reverie at least\\nequally painful, started up in preparation for going, and said--\\n\\n\"there is no use in staying here; i must be off.\"\\n\\n\"are you going back to town?\"\\n\\n\"no--to combe magna.  i have business there;\\nfrom thence to town in a day or two.  good bye.\"\\n\\nhe held out his hand.  she could not refuse to give\\nhim hers\\'s;--he pressed it with affection.\\n\\n\"and you do think something better of me than\\nyou did?\"--said he, letting it fall, and leaning against\\nthe mantel-piece as if forgetting he was to go.\\n\\nelinor assured him that she did;--that she forgave,\\npitied, wished him well--was even interested in his\\nhappiness--and added some gentle counsel as to the behaviour\\nmost likely to promote it.  his answer was not very encouraging.\\n\\n\"as to that,\" said he, \"i must rub through the world\\nas well as i can.  domestic happiness is out of the question.\\nif, however, i am allowed to think that you and yours feel\\nan interest in my fate and actions, it may be the means--it\\nmay put me on my guard--at least, it may be something to\\nlive for.  marianne to be sure is lost to me for ever.\\nwere i even by any blessed chance at liberty again--\"\\n\\nelinor stopped him with a reproof.\\n\\n\"well,\"--he replied--\"once more good bye. i shall\\nnow go away and live in dread of one event.\"\\n\\n\"what do you mean?\"\\n\\n\"your sister\\'s marriage.\"\\n\\n\"you are very wrong.  she can never be more lost\\nto you than she is now.\"\\n\\n\"but she will be gained by some one else.  and if\\nthat some one should be the very he whom, of all others,\\ni could least bear--but i will not stay to rob myself\\nof all your compassionate goodwill, by shewing\\nthat where i have most injured i can least forgive.\\ngood bye,--god bless you!\"\\n\\nand with these words, he almost ran out of the room.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 45\\n\\n\\nelinor, for some time after he left her, for some time\\neven after the sound of his carriage had died away, remained\\ntoo much oppressed by a crowd of ideas, widely differing in\\nthemselves, but of which sadness was the general result,\\nto think even of her sister.\\n\\nwilloughby, he, whom only half an hour ago she had\\nabhorred as the most worthless of men, willoughby, in spite\\nof all his faults, excited a degree of commiseration\\nfor the sufferings produced by them, which made her\\nthink of him as now separated for ever from her family,\\nwith a tenderness, a regret, rather in proportion, as she\\nsoon acknowledged within herself--to his wishes than to\\nhis merits.  she felt that his influence over her mind\\nwas heightened by circumstances which ought not in reason\\nto have weight; by that person of uncommon attraction,\\nthat open, affectionate, and lively manner which it\\nwas no merit to possess; and by that still ardent love\\nfor marianne, which it was not even innocent to indulge.\\nbut she felt that it was so, long, long before she could\\nfeel his influence less.\\n\\nwhen at last she returned to the unconscious marianne,\\nshe found her just awaking, refreshed by so long and sweet\\na sleep to the extent of her hopes.  elinor\\'s heart was full.\\nthe past, the present, the future, willoughby\\'s visit,\\nmarianne\\'s safety, and her mother\\'s expected arrival,\\nthrew her altogether into an agitation of spirits\\nwhich kept off every indication of fatigue, and made\\nher only fearful of betraying herself to her sister.\\nshort was the time, however, in which that fear could\\naffect her, for within half an hour after willoughby\\'s\\nleaving the house, she was again called down stairs\\nby the sound of another carriage.--eager to save her\\nmother from every unnecessary moment\\'s horrible suspense,\\nshe ran immediately into the hall, and reached the outward\\ndoor just in time to receive and support her as she entered it.\\n\\nmrs. dashwood, whose terror as they drew near the\\nhouse had produced almost the conviction of marianne\\'s\\nbeing no more, had no voice to inquire after her,\\nno voice even for elinor; but she, waiting neither for\\nsalutation nor inquiry, instantly gave the joyful relief;--\\nand her mother, catching it with all her usual warmth,\\nwas in a moment as much overcome by her happiness, as she\\nhad been before by her fears.  she was supported into\\nthe drawing-room between her daughter and her friend;--\\nand there, shedding tears of joy, though still unable\\nto speak, embraced elinor again and again, turning from her\\nat intervals to press colonel brandon\\'s hand, with a look\\nwhich spoke at once her gratitude, and her conviction\\nof his sharing with herself in the bliss of the moment.\\nhe shared it, however, in a silence even greater than her own.\\n\\nas soon as mrs. dashwood had recovered herself,\\nto see marianne was her first desire; and in two minutes she\\nwas with her beloved child, rendered dearer to her than ever\\nby absence, unhappiness, and danger.  elinor\\'s delight,\\nas she saw what each felt in the meeting, was only checked\\nby an apprehension of its robbing marianne of farther sleep;--\\nbut mrs. dashwood could be calm, could be even prudent,\\nwhen the life of a child was at stake, and marianne,\\nsatisfied in knowing her mother was near her, and conscious\\nof being too weak for conversation, submitted readily to the\\nsilence and quiet prescribed by every nurse around her.\\nmrs. dashwood would sit up with her all night; and elinor,\\nin compliance with her mother\\'s entreaty, went to bed.\\nbut the rest, which one night entirely sleepless,\\nand many hours of the most wearing anxiety seemed to\\nmake requisite, was kept off by irritation of spirits.\\nwilloughby, \"poor willoughby,\" as she now allowed\\nherself to call him, was constantly in her thoughts; she\\nwould not but have heard his vindication for the world,\\nand now blamed, now acquitted herself for having judged him\\nso harshly before.  but her promise of relating it to her\\nsister was invariably painful.  she dreaded the performance\\nof it, dreaded what its effect on marianne might be;\\ndoubted whether after such an explanation she could ever\\nbe happy with another; and for a moment wished willoughby\\na widower.  then, remembering colonel brandon, reproved herself,\\nfelt that to his sufferings and his constancy far more\\nthan to his rival\\'s, the reward of her sister was due,\\nand wished any thing rather than mrs. willoughby\\'s death.\\n\\nthe shock of colonel brandon\\'s errand at barton had been\\nmuch softened to mrs. dashwood by her own previous alarm;\\nfor so great was her uneasiness about marianne, that she\\nhad already determined to set out for cleveland on that\\nvery day, without waiting for any further intelligence,\\nand had so far settled her journey before his arrival,\\nthat the careys were then expected every moment to fetch\\nmargaret away, as her mother was unwilling to take her\\nwhere there might be infection.\\n\\nmarianne continued to mend every day, and the brilliant\\ncheerfulness of mrs. dashwood\\'s looks and spirits proved\\nher to be, as she repeatedly declared herself, one of\\nthe happiest women in the world.  elinor could not hear\\nthe declaration, nor witness its proofs without sometimes\\nwondering whether her mother ever recollected edward.\\nbut mrs. dashwood, trusting to the temperate account\\nof her own disappointment which elinor had sent her,\\nwas led away by the exuberance of her joy to think only\\nof what would increase it.  marianne was restored to her\\nfrom a danger in which, as she now began to feel,\\nher own mistaken judgment in encouraging the unfortunate\\nattachment to willoughby, had contributed to place her;--\\nand in her recovery she had yet another source of joy\\nunthought of by elinor.  it was thus imparted to her,\\nas soon as any opportunity of private conference\\nbetween them occurred.\\n\\n\"at last we are alone.  my elinor, you do not yet\\nknow all my happiness.  colonel brandon loves marianne.\\nhe has told me so himself.\"\\n\\nher daughter, feeling by turns both pleased and pained,\\nsurprised and not surprised, was all silent attention.\\n\\n\"you are never like me, dear elinor, or i should\\nwonder at your composure now.  had i sat down to wish\\nfor any possible good to my family, i should have fixed\\non colonel brandon\\'s marrying one of you as the object\\nmost desirable.  and i believe marianne will be the most\\nhappy with him of the two.\"\\n\\nelinor was half inclined to ask her reason for thinking so,\\nbecause satisfied that none founded on an impartial\\nconsideration of their age, characters, or feelings,\\ncould be given;--but her mother must always be carried\\naway by her imagination on any interesting subject,\\nand therefore instead of an inquiry, she passed it off with a\\nsmile.\\n\\n\"he opened his whole heart to me yesterday as we travelled.\\nit came out quite unawares, quite undesignedly.  i, you may\\nwell believe, could talk of nothing but my child;--he could\\nnot conceal his distress; i saw that it equalled my own,\\nand he perhaps, thinking that mere friendship, as the world\\nnow goes, would not justify so warm a sympathy--or rather,\\nnot thinking at all, i suppose--giving way to irresistible\\nfeelings, made me acquainted with his earnest, tender, constant,\\naffection for marianne.  he has loved her, my elinor, ever since\\nthe first moment of seeing her.\"\\n\\nhere, however, elinor perceived,--not the language,\\nnot the professions of colonel brandon, but the natural\\nembellishments of her mother\\'s active fancy, which fashioned\\nevery thing delightful to her as it chose.\\n\\n\"his regard for her, infinitely surpassing anything\\nthat willoughby ever felt or feigned, as much more warm,\\nas more sincere or constant--which ever we are to call it--\\nhas subsisted through all the knowledge of dear marianne\\'s\\nunhappy prepossession for that worthless young man!--and\\nwithout selfishness--without encouraging a hope!--could\\nhe have seen her happy with another--such a noble mind!--\\nsuch openness, such sincerity!--no one can be deceived\\nin him.\"\\n\\n\"colonel brandon\\'s character,\" said elinor,\\n\"as an excellent man, is well established.\"\\n\\n\"i know it is\"--replied her mother seriously, \"or\\nafter such a warning, i should be the last to encourage\\nsuch affection, or even to be pleased by it.  but his coming\\nfor me as he did, with such active, such ready friendship,\\nis enough to prove him one of the worthiest of men.\"\\n\\n\"his character, however,\" answered elinor, \"does not rest\\non one act of kindness, to which his affection for marianne,\\nwere humanity out of the case, would have prompted him.\\nto mrs. jennings, to the middletons, he has been long\\nand intimately known; they equally love and respect him;\\nand even my own knowledge of him, though lately acquired,\\nis very considerable; and so highly do i value and esteem him,\\nthat if marianne can be happy with him, i shall be as ready\\nas yourself to think our connection the greatest blessing\\nto us in the world.  what answer did you give him?--did you\\nallow him to hope?\"\\n\\n\"oh! my love, i could not then talk of hope to him\\nor to myself.  marianne might at that moment be dying.\\nbut he did not ask for hope or encouragement.  his was\\nan involuntary confidence, an irrepressible effusion\\nto a soothing friend--not an application to a parent.\\nyet after a time i did say, for at first i was quite\\novercome--that if she lived, as i trusted she might,\\nmy greatest happiness would lie in promoting their marriage;\\nand since our arrival, since our delightful security,\\ni have repeated it to him more fully, have given him every\\nencouragement in my power.  time, a very little time,\\ni tell him, will do everything;--marianne\\'s heart is\\nnot to be wasted for ever on such a man as willoughby.--\\nhis own merits must soon secure it.\"\\n\\n\"to judge from the colonel\\'s spirits, however,\\nyou have not yet made him equally sanguine.\"\\n\\n\"no.--he thinks marianne\\'s affection too deeply\\nrooted for any change in it under a great length of time,\\nand even supposing her heart again free, is too diffident\\nof himself to believe, that with such a difference of age\\nand disposition he could ever attach her.  there, however,\\nhe is quite mistaken.  his age is only so much beyond\\nhers as to be an advantage, as to make his character and\\nprinciples fixed;--and his disposition, i am well convinced,\\nis exactly the very one to make your sister happy.\\nand his person, his manners too, are all in his favour.\\nmy partiality does not blind me; he certainly is not\\nso handsome as willoughby--but at the same time,\\nthere is something much more pleasing in his countenance.--\\nthere was always a something,--if you remember,--in willoughby\\'s\\neyes at times, which i did not like.\"\\n\\nelinor could not remember it;--but her mother,\\nwithout waiting for her assent, continued,\\n\\n\"and his manners, the colonel\\'s manners are not only\\nmore pleasing to me than willoughby\\'s ever were, but they\\nare of a kind i well know to be more solidly attaching\\nto marianne.  their gentleness, their genuine attention\\nto other people, and their manly unstudied simplicity\\nis much more accordant with her real disposition, than\\nthe liveliness--often artificial, and often ill-timed\\nof the other.  i am very sure myself, that had willoughby\\nturned out as really amiable, as he has proved himself\\nthe contrary, marianne would yet never have been so happy\\nwith him, as she will be with colonel brandon.\"\\n\\nshe paused.--her daughter could not quite agree\\nwith her, but her dissent was not heard, and therefore\\ngave no offence.\\n\\n\"at delaford, she will be within an easy distance of me,\"\\nadded mrs. dashwood, \"even if i remain at barton; and in all\\nprobability,--for i hear it is a large village,--indeed there\\ncertainly must be some small house or cottage close by,\\nthat would suit us quite as well as our present situation.\"\\n\\npoor elinor!--here was a new scheme for getting\\nher to delaford!--but her spirit was stubborn.\\n\\n\"his fortune too!--for at my time of life you know,\\neverybody cares about that;--and though i neither know\\nnor desire to know, what it really is, i am sure it must be\\na good one.\"\\n\\nhere they were interrupted by the entrance of a\\nthird person, and elinor withdrew to think it all over\\nin private, to wish success to her friend, and yet\\nin wishing it, to feel a pang for willoughby.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 46\\n\\n\\nmarianne\\'s illness, though weakening in its kind,\\nhad not been long enough to make her recovery slow;\\nand with youth, natural strength, and her mother\\'s presence\\nin aid, it proceeded so smoothly as to enable her to remove,\\nwithin four days after the arrival of the latter,\\ninto mrs. palmer\\'s dressing-room.  when there, at her own\\nparticular request, for she was impatient to pour forth\\nher thanks to him for fetching her mother, colonel brandon\\nwas invited to visit her.\\n\\nhis emotion on entering the room, in seeing her altered\\nlooks, and in receiving the pale hand which she immediately\\nheld out to him, was such, as, in elinor\\'s conjecture,\\nmust arise from something more than his affection for marianne,\\nor the consciousness of its being known to others;\\nand she soon discovered in his melancholy eye and varying\\ncomplexion as he looked at her sister, the probable\\nrecurrence of many past scenes of misery to his mind,\\nbrought back by that resemblance between marianne and eliza\\nalready acknowledged, and now strengthened by the hollow eye,\\nthe sickly skin, the posture of reclining weakness,\\nand the warm acknowledgment of peculiar obligation.\\n\\nmrs. dashwood, not less watchful of what passed than\\nher daughter, but with a mind very differently influenced,\\nand therefore watching to very different effect,\\nsaw nothing in the colonel\\'s behaviour but what arose\\nfrom the most simple and self-evident sensations, while in\\nthe actions and words of marianne she persuaded herself\\nto think that something more than gratitude already dawned.\\n\\nat the end of another day or two, marianne growing\\nvisibly stronger every twelve hours, mrs. dashwood,\\nurged equally by her own and her daughter\\'s wishes,\\nbegan to talk of removing to barton.  on her measures\\ndepended those of her two friends; mrs. jennings could\\nnot quit cleveland during the dashwoods\\' stay; and colonel\\nbrandon was soon brought, by their united request,\\nto consider his own abode there as equally determinate,\\nif not equally indispensable.  at his and mrs. jennings\\'s\\nunited request in return, mrs. dashwood was prevailed\\non to accept the use of his carriage on her journey back,\\nfor the better accommodation of her sick child; and the colonel,\\nat the joint invitation of mrs. dashwood and mrs. jennings,\\nwhose active good-nature made her friendly and hospitable\\nfor other people as well as herself, engaged with pleasure\\nto redeem it by a visit at the cottage, in the course\\nof a few weeks.\\n\\nthe day of separation and departure arrived;\\nand marianne, after taking so particular and lengthened\\na leave of mrs. jennings, one so earnestly grateful, so full\\nof respect and kind wishes as seemed due to her own heart\\nfrom a secret acknowledgment of past inattention, and bidding\\ncolonel brandon farewell with a cordiality of a friend,\\nwas carefully assisted by him into the carriage, of which he\\nseemed anxious that she should engross at least half.\\nmrs. dashwood and elinor then followed, and the others\\nwere left by themselves, to talk of the travellers,\\nand feel their own dullness, till mrs. jennings was summoned\\nto her chaise to take comfort in the gossip of her maid\\nfor the loss of her two young companions; and colonel brandon\\nimmediately afterwards took his solitary way to delaford.\\n\\nthe dashwoods were two days on the road, and marianne\\nbore her journey on both, without essential fatigue.\\nevery thing that the most zealous affection, the most\\nsolicitous care could do to render her comfortable,\\nwas the office of each watchful companion, and each\\nfound their reward in her bodily ease, and her calmness\\nof spirits.  to elinor, the observation of the latter\\nwas particularly grateful.  she, who had seen her week\\nafter week so constantly suffering, oppressed by anguish\\nof heart which she had neither courage to speak of,\\nnor fortitude to conceal, now saw with a joy, which no other\\ncould equally share, an apparent composure of mind, which,\\nin being the result as she trusted of serious reflection,\\nmust eventually lead her to contentment and cheerfulness.\\n\\nas they approached barton, indeed, and entered\\non scenes of which every field and every tree brought\\nsome peculiar, some painful recollection, she grew silent\\nand thoughtful, and turning away her face from their notice,\\nsat earnestly gazing through the window.  but here,\\nelinor could neither wonder nor blame; and when she saw,\\nas she assisted marianne from the carriage, that she\\nhad been crying, she saw only an emotion too natural\\nin itself to raise any thing less tender than pity,\\nand in its unobtrusiveness entitled to praise.  in the\\nwhole of her subsequent manner, she traced the direction\\nof a mind awakened to reasonable exertion; for no sooner\\nhad they entered their common sitting-room, than marianne\\nturned her eyes around it with a look of resolute firmness,\\nas if determined at once to accustom herself to the sight\\nof every object with which the remembrance of willoughby could\\nbe connected.--she said little, but every sentence aimed\\nat cheerfulness, and though a sigh sometimes escaped her,\\nit never passed away without the atonement of a smile.\\nafter dinner she would try her piano-forte. she went to it;\\nbut the music on which her eye first rested was an opera,\\nprocured for her by willoughby, containing some of their\\nfavourite duets, and bearing on its outward leaf her own name\\nin his hand-writing.--that would not do.--she shook her head,\\nput the music aside, and after running over the keys\\nfor a minute, complained of feebleness in her fingers,\\nand closed the instrument again; declaring however with firmness\\nas she did so, that she should in future practice much.\\n\\nthe next morning produced no abatement in these\\nhappy symptoms.  on the contrary, with a mind and body\\nalike strengthened by rest, she looked and spoke with\\nmore genuine spirit, anticipating the pleasure of\\nmargaret\\'s return, and talking of the dear family party\\nwhich would then be restored, of their mutual pursuits\\nand cheerful society, as the only happiness worth a wish.\\n\\n\"when the weather is settled, and i have recovered\\nmy strength,\" said she, \"we will take long walks together\\nevery day.  we will walk to the farm at the edge of the down,\\nand see how the children go on; we will walk to sir john\\'s\\nnew plantations at barton cross, and the abbeyland;\\nand we will often go the old ruins of the priory,\\nand try to trace its foundations as far as we are told\\nthey once reached.  i know we shall be happy.  i know\\nthe summer will pass happily away.  i mean never to be\\nlater in rising than six, and from that time till dinner\\ni shall divide every moment between music and reading.\\ni have formed my plan, and am determined to enter on a course\\nof serious study.  our own library is too well known to me,\\nto be resorted to for any thing beyond mere amusement.\\nbut there are many works well worth reading at the park;\\nand there are others of more modern production which i\\nknow i can borrow of colonel brandon.  by reading only six\\nhours a-day, i shall gain in the course of a twelve-month\\na great deal of instruction which i now feel myself to want.\"\\n\\nelinor honoured her for a plan which originated\\nso nobly as this; though smiling to see the same eager\\nfancy which had been leading her to the extreme of languid\\nindolence and selfish repining, now at work in introducing\\nexcess into a scheme of such rational employment and virtuous\\nself-control. her smile however changed to a sigh when she\\nremembered that promise to willoughby was yet unfulfilled,\\nand feared she had that to communicate which might again\\nunsettle the mind of marianne, and ruin at least for a time\\nthis fair prospect of busy tranquillity.  willing therefore\\nto delay the evil hour, she resolved to wait till her\\nsister\\'s health were more secure, before she appointed it.\\nbut the resolution was made only to be broken.\\n\\nmarianne had been two or three days at home, before\\nthe weather was fine enough for an invalid like herself\\nto venture out.  but at last a soft, genial morning appeared;\\nsuch as might tempt the daughter\\'s wishes and the\\nmother\\'s confidence; and marianne, leaning on elinor\\'s arm,\\nwas authorised to walk as long as she could without fatigue,\\nin the lane before the house.\\n\\nthe sisters set out at a pace, slow as the feebleness\\nof marianne in an exercise hitherto untried since her\\nillness required;--and they had advanced only so far\\nbeyond the house as to admit a full view of the hill,\\nthe important hill behind, when pausing with her eyes\\nturned towards it, marianne calmly said,\\n\\n\"there, exactly there,\"--pointing with one hand,\\n\"on that projecting mound,--there i fell; and there\\ni first saw willoughby.\"\\n\\nher voice sunk with the word, but presently reviving she added,\\n\\n\"i am thankful to find that i can look with so little pain\\non the spot!--shall we ever talk on that subject, elinor?\"--\\nhesitatingly it was said.--\"or will it be wrong?--i can talk\\nof it now, i hope, as i ought to do.\"--\\n\\nelinor tenderly invited her to be open.\\n\\n\"as for regret,\" said marianne, \"i have done with that,\\nas far as he is concerned.  i do not mean to talk to you\\nof what my feelings have been for him, but what they\\nare now.--at present, if i could be satisfied on one point,\\nif i could be allowed to think that he was not always\\nacting a part, not always deceiving me;--but above all,\\nif i could be assured that he never was so very wicked\\nas my fears have sometimes fancied him, since the story\\nof that unfortunate girl\"--\\n\\nshe stopt.  elinor joyfully treasured her words\\nas she answered,\\n\\n\"if you could be assured of that, you think you\\nshould be easy.\"\\n\\n\"yes. my peace of mind is doubly involved in it;--\\nfor not only is it horrible to suspect a person, who has\\nbeen what he has been to me, of such designs,--but what must\\nit make me appear to myself?--what in a situation like mine,\\nbut a most shamefully unguarded affection could expose\\nme to\"--\\n\\n\"how then,\" asked her sister, \"would you account\\nfor his behaviour?\"\\n\\n\"i would suppose him,--oh, how gladly would i suppose him,\\nonly fickle, very, very fickle.\"\\n\\nelinor said no more.  she was debating within herself\\non the eligibility of beginning her story directly,\\nor postponing it till marianne were in stronger health;--\\nand they crept on for a few minutes in silence.\\n\\n\"i am not wishing him too much good,\" said marianne\\nat last with a sigh, \"when i wish his secret reflections\\nmay be no more unpleasant than my own.  he will suffer\\nenough in them.\"\\n\\n\"do you compare your conduct with his?\"\\n\\n\"no. i compare it with what it ought to have been;\\ni compare it with yours.\"\\n\\n\"our situations have borne little resemblance.\"\\n\\n\"they have borne more than our conduct.--do not,\\nmy dearest elinor, let your kindness defend what i know\\nyour judgment must censure.  my illness has made me think--\\nit has given me leisure and calmness for serious recollection.\\nlong before i was enough recovered to talk, i was perfectly\\nable to reflect.  i considered the past: i saw in my\\nown behaviour, since the beginning of our acquaintance\\nwith him last autumn, nothing but a series of imprudence\\ntowards myself, and want of kindness to others.\\ni saw that my own feelings had prepared my sufferings,\\nand that my want of fortitude under them had almost led\\nme to the grave.  my illness, i well knew, had been\\nentirely brought on by myself by such negligence of my\\nown health, as i had felt even at the time to be wrong.\\nhad i died,--it would have been self-destruction. i\\ndid not know my danger till the danger was removed;\\nbut with such feelings as these reflections gave me,\\ni wonder at my recovery,--wonder that the very eagerness\\nof my desire to live, to have time for atonement to my god,\\nand to you all, did not kill me at once.  had i died,--\\nin what peculiar misery should i have left you, my nurse,\\nmy friend, my sister!--you, who had seen all the fretful\\nselfishness of my latter days; who had known all the\\nmurmurings of my heart!--how should i have lived in your\\nremembrance!--my mother too! how could you have consoled\\nher!--i cannot express my own abhorrence of myself.\\nwhenever i looked towards the past, i saw some duty neglected,\\nor some failing indulged.  every body seemed injured by me.\\nthe kindness, the unceasing kindness of mrs. jennings,\\ni had repaid with ungrateful contempt.  to the middletons,\\nto the palmers, the steeles, to every common acquaintance even,\\ni had been insolent and unjust; with a heart hardened\\nagainst their merits, and a temper irritated by their\\nvery attention.--to john, to fanny,--yes, even to them,\\nlittle as they deserve, i had given less than their due.\\nbut you,--you above all, above my mother, had been wronged\\nby me.  i, and only i, knew your heart and its sorrows;\\nyet to what did it influence me?--not to any compassion\\nthat could benefit you or myself.--your example was\\nbefore me; but to what avail?--was i more considerate\\nof you and your comfort?  did i imitate your forbearance,\\nor lessen your restraints, by taking any part in those\\noffices of general complaisance or particular gratitude\\nwhich you had hitherto been left to discharge alone?--no;--\\nnot less when i knew you to be unhappy, than when i\\nhad believed you at ease, did i turn away from every\\nexertion of duty or friendship; scarcely allowing sorrow\\nto exist but with me, regretting only that heart\\nwhich had deserted and wronged me, and leaving you,\\nfor or i professed an unbounded affection, to be miserable\\nfor my sake.\"\\n\\nhere ceased the rapid flow of her self-reproving spirit;\\nand elinor, impatient to soothe, though too honest\\nto flatter, gave her instantly that praise and support\\nwhich her frankness and her contrition so well deserved.\\nmarianne pressed her hand and replied,\\n\\n\"you are very good.--the future must be my proof.\\ni have laid down my plan, and if i am capable of adhering\\nto it--my feelings shall be governed and my temper improved.\\nthey shall no longer worry others, nor torture myself.\\ni shall now live solely for my family.  you, my mother,\\nand margaret, must henceforth be all the world to me;\\nyou will share my affections entirely between you.\\n>from you, from my home, i shall never again have the smallest\\nincitement to move; and if i do mix in other society,\\nit will be only to shew that my spirit is humbled,\\nmy heart amended, and that i can practise the civilities,\\nthe lesser duties of life, with gentleness and forbearance.\\nas for willoughby--to say that i shall soon or that i shall\\never forget him, would be idle.  his remembrance can be overcome\\nby no change of circumstances or opinions.  but it shall\\nbe regulated, it shall be checked by religion, by reason,\\nby constant employment.\"\\n\\nshe paused--and added in a low voice, \"if i could\\nbut know his heart, everything would become easy.\"\\n\\nelinor, who had now been for some time reflecting\\non the propriety or impropriety of speedily hazarding\\nher narration, without feeling at all nearer decision than\\nat first, heard this; and perceiving that as reflection\\ndid nothing, resolution must do all, soon found herself\\nleading to the fact.\\n\\nshe managed the recital, as she hoped, with address;\\nprepared her anxious listener with caution; related simply\\nand honestly the chief points on which willoughby\\ngrounded his apology; did justice to his repentance,\\nand softened only his protestations of present regard.\\nmarianne said not a word.--she trembled, her eyes\\nwere fixed on the ground, and her lips became whiter\\nthan even sickness had left them.  a thousand inquiries\\nsprung up from her heart, but she dared not urge one.\\nshe caught every syllable with panting eagerness; her hand,\\nunknowingly to herself, closely pressed her sister\\'s, and\\ntears covered her cheeks.\\n\\nelinor, dreading her being tired, led her towards home;\\nand till they reached the door of the cottage,\\neasily conjecturing what her curiosity must be\\nthough no question was suffered to speak it, talked of\\nnothing but willoughby, and their conversation together;\\nand was carefully minute in every particular of speech\\nand look, where minuteness could be safely indulged.\\nas soon as they entered the house, marianne with a kiss\\nof gratitude and these two words just articulate through\\nher tears, \"tell mama,\" withdrew from her sister and\\nwalked slowly up stairs.  elinor would not attempt\\nto disturb a solitude so reasonable as what she now sought;\\nand with a mind anxiously pre-arranging its result,\\nand a resolution of reviving the subject again,\\nshould marianne fail to do it, she turned into the parlour\\nto fulfill her parting injunction.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 47\\n\\n\\nmrs. dashwood did not hear unmoved the vindication\\nof her former favourite.  she rejoiced in his being\\ncleared from some part of his imputed guilt;--she was\\nsorry for him;--she wished him happy.  but the feelings\\nof the past could not be recalled.--nothing could restore\\nhim with a faith unbroken--a character unblemished,\\nto marianne.  nothing could do away the knowledge\\nof what the latter had suffered through his means,\\nnor remove the guilt of his conduct towards eliza.\\nnothing could replace him, therefore, in her former esteem,\\nnor injure the interests of colonel brandon.\\n\\nhad mrs. dashwood, like her daughter, heard willoughby\\'s\\nstory from himself--had she witnessed his distress,\\nand been under the influence of his countenance and his\\nmanner, it is probable that her compassion would have\\nbeen greater.  but it was neither in elinor\\'s power,\\nnor in her wish, to rouse such feelings in another, by her\\nretailed explanation, as had at first been called forth\\nin herself.  reflection had given calmness to her judgment,\\nand sobered her own opinion of willoughby\\'s deserts;--\\nshe wished, therefore, to declare only the simple truth,\\nand lay open such facts as were really due to his character,\\nwithout any embellishment of tenderness to lead the\\nfancy astray.\\n\\nin the evening, when they were all three together,\\nmarianne began voluntarily to speak of him again;--\\nbut that it was not without an effort, the restless,\\nunquiet thoughtfulness in which she had been for some time\\npreviously sitting--her rising colour, as she spoke,--\\nand her unsteady voice, plainly shewed.\\n\\n\"i wish to assure you both,\" said she, \"that i see\\nevery thing--as you can desire me to do.\"\\n\\nmrs. dashwood would have interrupted her instantly\\nwith soothing tenderness, had not elinor, who really wished\\nto hear her sister\\'s unbiased opinion, by an eager sign,\\nengaged her silence.  marianne slowly continued--\\n\\n\"it is a great relief to me--what elinor told\\nme this morning--i have now heard exactly what i\\nwished to hear.\"--for some moments her voice was lost;\\nbut recovering herself, she added, and with greater\\ncalmness than before--\"i am now perfectly satisfied,\\ni wish for no change.  i never could have been happy\\nwith him, after knowing, as sooner or later i must\\nhave known, all this.--i should have had no confidence,\\nno esteem.  nothing could have done it away to my feelings.\"\\n\\n\"i know it--i know it,\" cried her mother.\\n\"happy with a man of libertine practices!--with one\\nwho so injured the peace of the dearest of our friends,\\nand the best of men!--no--my marianne has not a heart\\nto be made happy with such a man!--her conscience, her\\nsensitive conscience, would have felt all that the\\nconscience of her husband ought to have felt.\"\\n\\nmarianne sighed, and repeated, \"i wish for no change.\"\\n\\n\"you consider the matter,\" said elinor, \"exactly as\\na good mind and a sound understanding must consider it;\\nand i dare say you perceive, as well as myself, not only\\nin this, but in many other circumstances, reason enough\\nto be convinced that your marriage must have involved you\\nin many certain troubles and disappointments, in which\\nyou would have been poorly supported by an affection,\\non his side, much less certain.  had you married,\\nyou must have been always poor.  his expensiveness is\\nacknowledged even by himself, and his whole conduct declares\\nthat self-denial is a word hardly understood by him.\\nhis demands and your inexperience together, on a small,\\nvery small income, must have brought on distresses which\\nwould not be the less grievous to you, from having been\\nentirely unknown and unthought of before.  your sense\\nof honour and honesty would have led you, i know,\\nwhen aware of your situation, to attempt all the economy\\nthat would appear to you possible: and, perhaps, as long\\nas your frugality retrenched only on your own comfort,\\nyou might have been suffered to practice it, but beyond that--\\nand how little could the utmost of your single management\\ndo to stop the ruin which had begun before your marriage?--\\nbeyond that, had you endeavoured, however reasonably,\\nto abridge his enjoyments, is it not to be feared, that instead\\nof prevailing on feelings so selfish to consent to it,\\nyou would have lessened your own influence on his heart,\\nand made him regret the connection which had involved him\\nin such difficulties?\"\\n\\nmarianne\\'s lips quivered, and she repeated the word\\n\"selfish?\" in a tone that implied--\"do you really think\\nhim selfish?\"\\n\\n\"the whole of his behaviour,\" replied elinor,\\n\"from the beginning to the end of the affair, has been\\ngrounded on selfishness.  it was selfishness which first\\nmade him sport with your affections; which afterwards,\\nwhen his own were engaged, made him delay the confession\\nof it, and which finally carried him from barton.\\nhis own enjoyment, or his own ease, was, in every particular,\\nhis ruling principle.\"\\n\\n\"it is very true.  my happiness never was his object.\"\\n\\n\"at present,\" continued elinor, \"he regrets what he\\nhas done.  and why does he regret it?--because he finds\\nit has not answered towards himself.  it has not made\\nhim happy.  his circumstances are now unembarrassed--he\\nsuffers from no evil of that kind; and he thinks only\\nthat he has married a woman of a less amiable temper\\nthan yourself.  but does it follow that had he married you,\\nhe would have been happy?--the inconveniences would have\\nbeen different.  he would then have suffered under the\\npecuniary distresses which, because they are removed,\\nhe now reckons as nothing.  he would have had a wife\\nof whose temper he could make no complaint, but he would\\nhave been always necessitous--always poor; and probably\\nwould soon have learned to rank the innumerable comforts\\nof a clear estate and good income as of far more importance,\\neven to domestic happiness, than the mere temper of a wife.\"\\n\\n\"i have not a doubt of it,\" said marianne; \"and i\\nhave nothing to regret--nothing but my own folly.\"\\n\\n\"rather say your mother\\'s imprudence, my child,\"\\nsaid mrs. dashwood; \"she must be answerable.\"\\n\\nmarianne would not let her proceed;--and elinor,\\nsatisfied that each felt their own error, wished to avoid\\nany survey of the past that might weaken her sister\\'s\\nspirits; she, therefore, pursuing the first subject,\\nimmediately continued,\\n\\n\"one observation may, i think, be fairly drawn from\\nthe whole of the story--that all willoughby\\'s difficulties\\nhave arisen from the first offence against virtue, in his\\nbehaviour to eliza williams.  that crime has been the origin\\nof every lesser one, and of all his present discontents.\"\\n\\nmarianne assented most feelingly to the remark;\\nand her mother was led by it to an enumeration of colonel\\nbrandon\\'s injuries and merits, warm as friendship\\nand design could unitedly dictate.  her daughter did\\nnot look, however, as if much of it were heard by her.\\n\\nelinor, according to her expectation, saw on the two\\nor three following days, that marianne did not continue\\nto gain strength as she had done; but while her resolution\\nwas unsubdued, and she still tried to appear cheerful\\nand easy, her sister could safely trust to the effect\\nof time upon her health.\\n\\nmargaret returned, and the family were again all\\nrestored to each other, again quietly settled at the cottage;\\nand if not pursuing their usual studies with quite\\nso much vigour as when they first came to barton,\\nat least planning a vigorous prosecution of them in future.\\n\\nelinor grew impatient for some tidings of edward.\\nshe had heard nothing of him since her leaving london,\\nnothing new of his plans, nothing certain even of his\\npresent abode.  some letters had passed between her\\nand her brother, in consequence of marianne\\'s illness;\\nand in the first of john\\'s, there had been this sentence:--\\n\"we know nothing of our unfortunate edward, and can make no\\nenquiries on so prohibited a subject, but conclude him\\nto be still at oxford;\" which was all the intelligence\\nof edward afforded her by the correspondence, for his name\\nwas not even mentioned in any of the succeeding letters.\\nshe was not doomed, however, to be long in ignorance of\\nhis measures.\\n\\ntheir man-servant had been sent one morning to exeter\\non business; and when, as he waited at table, he had\\nsatisfied the inquiries of his mistress as to the event\\nof his errand, this was his voluntary communication--\\n\\n\"i suppose you know, ma\\'am, that mr. ferrars is married.\"\\n\\nmarianne gave a violent start, fixed her eyes\\nupon elinor, saw her turning pale, and fell back in her\\nchair in hysterics.  mrs. dashwood, whose eyes, as she\\nanswered the servant\\'s inquiry, had intuitively taken\\nthe same direction, was shocked to perceive by elinor\\'s\\ncountenance how much she really suffered, and a moment\\nafterwards, alike distressed by marianne\\'s situation,\\nknew not on which child to bestow her principal attention.\\n\\nthe servant, who saw only that miss marianne was\\ntaken ill, had sense enough to call one of the maids,\\nwho, with mrs. dashwood\\'s assistance, supported her into\\nthe other room.  by that time, marianne was rather better,\\nand her mother leaving her to the care of margaret\\nand the maid, returned to elinor, who, though still\\nmuch disordered, had so far recovered the use of her reason\\nand voice as to be just beginning an inquiry of thomas,\\nas to the source of his intelligence.  mrs. dashwood\\nimmediately took all that trouble on herself; and elinor\\nhad the benefit of the information without the exertion\\nof seeking it.\\n\\n\"who told you that mr. ferrars was married, thomas?\"\\n\\n\"i see mr. ferrars myself, ma\\'am, this morning\\nin exeter, and his lady too, miss steele as was.  they was\\nstopping in a chaise at the door of the new london inn,\\nas i went there with a message from sally at the park\\nto her brother, who is one of the post-boys. i happened\\nto look up as i went by the chaise, and so i see directly\\nit was the youngest miss steele; so i took off my hat,\\nand she knew me and called to me, and inquired after you,\\nma\\'am, and the young ladies, especially miss marianne,\\nand bid me i should give her compliments and mr. ferrars\\'s,\\ntheir best compliments and service, and how sorry they\\nwas they had not time to come on and see you, but they was\\nin a great hurry to go forwards, for they was going further\\ndown for a little while, but howsever, when they come back,\\nthey\\'d make sure to come and see you.\"\\n\\n\"but did she tell you she was married, thomas?\"\\n\\n\"yes, ma\\'am. she smiled, and said how she\\nhad changed her name since she was in these parts.\\nshe was always a very affable and free-spoken young lady,\\nand very civil behaved.  so, i made free to wish her joy.\"\\n\\n\"was mr. ferrars in the carriage with her?\"\\n\\n\"yes, ma\\'am, i just see him leaning back in it,\\nbut he did not look up;--he never was a gentleman much\\nfor talking.\"\\n\\nelinor\\'s heart could easily account for his not\\nputting himself forward; and mrs. dashwood probably\\nfound the same explanation.\\n\\n\"was there no one else in the carriage?\"\\n\\n\"no, ma\\'am, only they two.\"\\n\\n\"do you know where they came from?\"\\n\\n\"they come straight from town, as miss lucy--\\nmrs. ferrars told me.\"\\n\\n\"and are they going farther westward?\"\\n\\n\"yes, ma\\'am--but not to bide long.  they will soon\\nbe back again, and then they\\'d be sure and call here.\"\\n\\nmrs. dashwood now looked at her daughter;\\nbut elinor knew better than to expect them.\\nshe recognised the whole of lucy in the message, and was\\nvery confident that edward would never come near them.\\nshe observed in a low voice, to her mother, that they\\nwere probably going down to mr. pratt\\'s, near plymouth.\\n\\nthomas\\'s intelligence seemed over.  elinor looked\\nas if she wished to hear more.\\n\\n\"did you see them off, before you came away?\"\\n\\n\"no, ma\\'am--the horses were just coming out, but i\\ncould not bide any longer; i was afraid of being late.\"\\n\\n\"did mrs. ferrars look well?\"\\n\\n\"yes, ma\\'am, she said how she was very well;\\nand to my mind she was always a very handsome young\\nlady--and she seemed vastly contented.\"\\n\\nmrs. dashwood could think of no other question,\\nand thomas and the tablecloth, now alike needless,\\nwere soon afterwards dismissed.  marianne had already sent\\nto say, that she should eat nothing more.  mrs. dashwood\\'s\\nand elinor\\'s appetites were equally lost, and margaret\\nmight think herself very well off, that with so much\\nuneasiness as both her sisters had lately experienced,\\nso much reason as they had often had to be careless\\nof their meals, she had never been obliged to go without\\nher dinner before.\\n\\nwhen the dessert and the wine were arranged,\\nand mrs. dashwood and elinor were left by themselves,\\nthey remained long together in a similarity of thoughtfulness\\nand silence.  mrs. dashwood feared to hazard any remark,\\nand ventured not to offer consolation.  she now found\\nthat she had erred in relying on elinor\\'s representation\\nof herself; and justly concluded that every thing\\nhad been expressly softened at the time, to spare her\\nfrom an increase of unhappiness, suffering as she then\\nhad suffered for marianne.  she found that she had been\\nmisled by the careful, the considerate attention of\\nher daughter, to think the attachment, which once she\\nhad so well understood, much slighter in reality, than\\nshe had been wont to believe, or than it was now proved\\nto be.  she feared that under this persuasion she had\\nbeen unjust, inattentive, nay, almost unkind, to her elinor;--\\nthat marianne\\'s affliction, because more acknowledged,\\nmore immediately before her, had too much engrossed\\nher tenderness, and led her away to forget that in elinor\\nshe might have a daughter suffering almost as much,\\ncertainly with less self-provocation, and greater fortitude.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 48\\n\\n\\nelinor now found the difference between the expectation\\nof an unpleasant event, however certain the mind may be told\\nto consider it, and certainty itself.  she now found, that\\nin spite of herself, she had always admitted a hope,\\nwhile edward remained single, that something would occur\\nto prevent his marrying lucy; that some resolution of\\nhis own, some mediation of friends, or some more eligible\\nopportunity of establishment for the lady, would arise\\nto assist the happiness of all.  but he was now married;\\nand she condemned her heart for the lurking flattery,\\nwhich so much heightened the pain of the intelligence.\\n\\nthat he should be married soon, before (as she imagined)\\nhe could be in orders, and consequently before he could\\nbe in possession of the living, surprised her a little\\nat first.  but she soon saw how likely it was that lucy,\\nin her self-provident care, in her haste to secure him,\\nshould overlook every thing but the risk of delay.\\nthey were married, married in town, and now hastening\\ndown to her uncle\\'s.  what had edward felt on being within\\nfour miles from barton, on seeing her mother\\'s servant,\\non hearing lucy\\'s message!\\n\\nthey would soon, she supposed, be settled at\\ndelaford.--delaford,--that place in which so much\\nconspired to give her an interest; which she wished\\nto be acquainted with, and yet desired to avoid.\\nshe saw them in an instant in their parsonage-house; saw\\nin lucy, the active, contriving manager, uniting at once\\na desire of smart appearance with the utmost frugality,\\nand ashamed to be suspected of half her economical practices;--\\npursuing her own interest in every thought, courting the\\nfavour of colonel brandon, of mrs. jennings, and of every\\nwealthy friend.  in edward--she knew not what she saw,\\nnor what she wished to see;--happy or unhappy,--nothing\\npleased her; she turned away her head from every sketch of him.\\n\\nelinor flattered herself that some one of their\\nconnections in london would write to them to announce\\nthe event, and give farther particulars,--but day after\\nday passed off, and brought no letter, no tidings.\\nthough uncertain that any one were to blame, she found\\nfault with every absent friend.  they were all thoughtless\\nor indolent.\\n\\n\"when do you write to colonel brandon, ma\\'am?\"\\nwas an inquiry which sprung from the impatience\\nof her mind to have something going on.\\n\\n\"i wrote to him, my love, last week, and rather\\nexpect to see, than to hear from him again.  i earnestly\\npressed his coming to us, and should not be surprised\\nto see him walk in today or tomorrow, or any day.\"\\n\\nthis was gaining something, something to look forward to.\\ncolonel brandon must have some information to give.\\n\\nscarcely had she so determined it, when the figure\\nof a man on horseback drew her eyes to the window.\\nhe stopt at their gate.  it was a gentleman, it\\nwas colonel brandon himself.  now she could hear more;\\nand she trembled in expectation of it.  but--it was\\nnot colonel brandon--neither his air--nor his height.\\nwere it possible, she must say it must be edward.\\nshe looked again.  he had just dismounted;--she could not be\\nmistaken,--it was edward.  she moved away and sat down.\\n\"he comes from mr. pratt\\'s purposely to see us.  i will be\\ncalm; i will be mistress of myself.\"\\n\\nin a moment she perceived that the others were likewise\\naware of the mistake.  she saw her mother and marianne\\nchange colour; saw them look at herself, and whisper\\na few sentences to each other.  she would have given\\nthe world to be able to speak--and to make them understand\\nthat she hoped no coolness, no slight, would appear\\nin their behaviour to him;--but she had no utterance,\\nand was obliged to leave all to their own discretion.\\n\\nnot a syllable passed aloud.  they all waited\\nin silence for the appearance of their visitor.\\nhis footsteps were heard along the gravel path; in a moment\\nhe was in the passage, and in another he was before them.\\n\\nhis countenance, as he entered the room, was not\\ntoo happy, even for elinor.  his complexion was white\\nwith agitation, and he looked as if fearful of his\\nreception, and conscious that he merited no kind one.\\nmrs. dashwood, however, conforming, as she trusted,\\nto the wishes of that daughter, by whom she then meant\\nin the warmth of her heart to be guided in every thing,\\nmet with a look of forced complacency, gave him her hand,\\nand wished him joy.\\n\\nhe coloured, and stammered out an unintelligible reply.\\nelinor\\'s lips had moved with her mother\\'s, and, when the\\nmoment of action was over, she wished that she had shaken\\nhands with him too.  but it was then too late, and with a\\ncountenance meaning to be open, she sat down again\\nand talked of the weather.\\n\\nmarianne had retreated as much as possible\\nout of sight, to conceal her distress; and margaret,\\nunderstanding some part, but not the whole of the case,\\nthought it incumbent on her to be dignified, and therefore\\ntook a seat as far from him as she could, and maintained\\na strict silence.\\n\\nwhen elinor had ceased to rejoice in the dryness\\nof the season, a very awful pause took place.  it was put\\nan end to by mrs. dashwood, who felt obliged to hope that he\\nhad left mrs. ferrars very well.  in a hurried manner,\\nhe replied in the affirmative.\\n\\nanother pause.\\n\\nelinor resolving to exert herself, though fearing\\nthe sound of her own voice, now said,\\n\\n\"is mrs. ferrars at longstaple?\"\\n\\n\"at longstaple!\" he replied, with an air of surprise.--\\n\"no, my mother is in town.\"\\n\\n\"i meant,\" said elinor, taking up some work from\\nthe table, \"to inquire for mrs. edward ferrars.\"\\n\\nshe dared not look up;--but her mother and marianne both\\nturned their eyes on him.  he coloured, seemed perplexed,\\nlooked doubtingly, and, after some hesitation, said,--\\n\\n\"perhaps you mean--my brother--you mean mrs.--mrs.\\nrobert ferrars.\"\\n\\n\"mrs. robert ferrars!\"--was repeated by marianne and her\\nmother in an accent of the utmost amazement;--and though\\nelinor could not speak, even her eyes were fixed on him\\nwith the same impatient wonder.  he rose from his seat,\\nand walked to the window, apparently from not knowing\\nwhat to do; took up a pair of scissors that lay there,\\nand while spoiling both them and their sheath by cutting\\nthe latter to pieces as he spoke, said, in a hurried voice,\\n\\n\"perhaps you do not know--you may not have heard\\nthat my brother is lately married to--to the youngest--to\\nmiss lucy steele.\"\\n\\nhis words were echoed with unspeakable astonishment\\nby all but elinor, who sat with her head leaning over\\nher work, in a state of such agitation as made her hardly\\nknow where she was.\\n\\n\"yes,\" said he, \"they were married last week,\\nand are now at dawlish.\"\\n\\nelinor could sit it no longer.  she almost ran\\nout of the room, and as soon as the door was closed,\\nburst into tears of joy, which at first she thought would\\nnever cease.  edward, who had till then looked any where,\\nrather than at her, saw her hurry away, and perhaps saw--\\nor even heard, her emotion; for immediately afterwards\\nhe fell into a reverie, which no remarks, no inquiries,\\nno affectionate address of mrs. dashwood could penetrate,\\nand at last, without saying a word, quitted the room,\\nand walked out towards the village--leaving the others\\nin the greatest astonishment and perplexity on a change\\nin his situation, so wonderful and so sudden;--a perplexity\\nwhich they had no means of lessening but by their\\nown conjectures.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 49\\n\\n\\nunaccountable, however, as the circumstances of his\\nrelease might appear to the whole family, it was certain\\nthat edward was free; and to what purpose that freedom would\\nbe employed was easily pre-determined by all;--for after\\nexperiencing the blessings of one imprudent engagement,\\ncontracted without his mother\\'s consent, as he had already\\ndone for more than four years, nothing less could be expected\\nof him in the failure of that, than the immediate contraction\\nof another.\\n\\nhis errand at barton, in fact, was a simple one.\\nit was only to ask elinor to marry him;--and considering\\nthat he was not altogether inexperienced in such a question,\\nit might be strange that he should feel so uncomfortable\\nin the present case as he really did, so much in need of\\nencouragement and fresh air.\\n\\nhow soon he had walked himself into the proper\\nresolution, however, how soon an opportunity of exercising\\nit occurred, in what manner he expressed himself,\\nand how he was received, need not be particularly told.\\nthis only need be said;--that when they all sat down to\\ntable at four o\\'clock, about three hours after his arrival,\\nhe had secured his lady, engaged her mother\\'s consent,\\nand was not only in the rapturous profession of\\nthe lover, but, in the reality of reason and truth,\\none of the happiest of men.  his situation indeed was\\nmore than commonly joyful.  he had more than the ordinary\\ntriumph of accepted love to swell his heart, and raise\\nhis spirits.  he was released without any reproach\\nto himself, from an entanglement which had long formed\\nhis misery, from a woman whom he had long ceased to love;--\\nand elevated at once to that security with another,\\nwhich he must have thought of almost with despair,\\nas soon as he had learnt to consider it with desire.\\nhe was brought, not from doubt or suspense, but from\\nmisery to happiness;--and the change was openly spoken\\nin such a genuine, flowing, grateful cheerfulness,\\nas his friends had never witnessed in him before.\\n\\nhis heart was now open to elinor, all its weaknesses,\\nall its errors confessed, and his first boyish attachment\\nto lucy treated with all the philosophic dignity of twenty-four.\\n\\n\"it was a foolish, idle inclination on my side,\"\\nsaid he, \"the consequence of ignorance of the world--\\nand want of employment.  had my brother given me\\nsome active profession when i was removed at eighteen\\nfrom the care of mr. pratt, i think--nay, i am sure,\\nit would never have happened; for though i left longstaple\\nwith what i thought, at the time, a most unconquerable\\npreference for his niece, yet had i then had any pursuit,\\nany object to engage my time and keep me at a distance\\nfrom her for a few months, i should very soon have\\noutgrown the fancied attachment, especially by mixing\\nmore with the world, as in such case i must have done.\\nbut instead of having any thing to do, instead of having any\\nprofession chosen for me, or being allowed to chuse any myself,\\ni returned home to be completely idle; and for the first\\ntwelvemonth afterwards i had not even the nominal employment,\\nwhich belonging to the university would have given me;\\nfor i was not entered at oxford till i was nineteen.\\ni had therefore nothing in the world to do, but to fancy\\nmyself in love; and as my mother did not make my home\\nin every respect comfortable, as i had no friend,\\nno companion in my brother, and disliked new acquaintance,\\nit was not unnatural for me to be very often at longstaple,\\nwhere i always felt myself at home, and was always sure\\nof a welcome; and accordingly i spent the greatest part\\nof my time there from eighteen to nineteen: lucy appeared\\neverything that was amiable and obliging.  she was pretty\\ntoo--at least i thought so then; and i had seen so little\\nof other women, that i could make no comparisons, and see\\nno defects.  considering everything, therefore, i hope,\\nfoolish as our engagement was, foolish as it has since\\nin every way been proved, it was not at the time an unnatural\\nor an inexcusable piece of folly.\"\\n\\nthe change which a few hours had wrought in the minds\\nand the happiness of the dashwoods, was such--so great--as\\npromised them all, the satisfaction of a sleepless night.\\nmrs. dashwood, too happy to be comfortable, knew not how\\nto love edward, nor praise elinor enough, how to be enough\\nthankful for his release without wounding his delicacy,\\nnor how at once to give them leisure for unrestrained\\nconversation together, and yet enjoy, as she wished,\\nthe sight and society of both.\\n\\nmarianne could speak her happiness only by tears.\\ncomparisons would occur--regrets would arise;--and her joy,\\nthough sincere as her love for her sister, was of a kind to\\ngive her neither spirits nor language.\\n\\nbut elinor--how are her feelings to be described?--from\\nthe moment of learning that lucy was married to another,\\nthat edward was free, to the moment of his justifying\\nthe hopes which had so instantly followed, she was every\\nthing by turns but tranquil.  but when the second moment\\nhad passed, when she found every doubt, every solicitude\\nremoved, compared her situation with what so lately it\\nhad been,--saw him honourably released from his former\\nengagement, saw him instantly profiting by the release,\\nto address herself and declare an affection as tender,\\nas constant as she had ever supposed it to be,--she\\nwas oppressed, she was overcome by her own felicity;--\\nand happily disposed as is the human mind to be easily\\nfamiliarized with any change for the better, it required\\nseveral hours to give sedateness to her spirits, or any\\ndegree of tranquillity to her heart.\\n\\nedward was now fixed at the cottage at least for\\na week;--for whatever other claims might be made on him,\\nit was impossible that less than a week should be given\\nup to the enjoyment of elinor\\'s company, or suffice\\nto say half that was to be said of the past, the present,\\nand the future;--for though a very few hours spent in\\nthe hard labor of incessant talking will despatch more\\nsubjects than can really be in common between any two\\nrational creatures, yet with lovers it is different.\\nbetween them no subject is finished, no communication\\nis even made, till it has been made at least twenty\\ntimes over.\\n\\nlucy\\'s marriage, the unceasing and reasonable wonder\\namong them all, formed of course one of the earliest\\ndiscussions of the lovers;--and elinor\\'s particular knowledge\\nof each party made it appear to her in every view, as one\\nof the most extraordinary and unaccountable circumstances\\nshe had ever heard.  how they could be thrown together,\\nand by what attraction robert could be drawn on to marry\\na girl, of whose beauty she had herself heard him speak\\nwithout any admiration,--a girl too already engaged\\nto his brother, and on whose account that brother had been\\nthrown off by his family--it was beyond her comprehension\\nto make out.  to her own heart it was a delightful affair,\\nto her imagination it was even a ridiculous one, but\\nto her reason, her judgment, it was completely a puzzle.\\n\\nedward could only attempt an explanation by supposing,\\nthat, perhaps, at first accidentally meeting, the vanity\\nof the one had been so worked on by the flattery\\nof the other, as to lead by degrees to all the rest.\\nelinor remembered what robert had told her in harley street,\\nof his opinion of what his own mediation in his brother\\'s\\naffairs might have done, if applied to in time.\\nshe repeated it to edward.\\n\\n\"that was exactly like robert,\"--was his immediate\\nobservation.--\"and that,\" he presently added, \"might\\nperhaps be in his head when the acquaintance between\\nthem first began.  and lucy perhaps at first might\\nthink only of procuring his good offices in my favour.\\nother designs might afterward arise.\"\\n\\nhow long it had been carrying on between them,\\nhowever, he was equally at a loss with herself to make out;\\nfor at oxford, where he had remained for choice ever since\\nhis quitting london, he had had no means of hearing of her\\nbut from herself, and her letters to the very last were\\nneither less frequent, nor less affectionate than usual.\\nnot the smallest suspicion, therefore, had ever occurred\\nto prepare him for what followed;--and when at last it\\nburst on him in a letter from lucy herself, he had been\\nfor some time, he believed, half stupified between\\nthe wonder, the horror, and the joy of such a deliverance.\\nhe put the letter into elinor\\'s hands.\\n\\n     \"dear sir,\\n\\n     \"being very sure i have long lost your affections,\\n     i have thought myself at liberty to bestow my own\\n     on another, and have no doubt of being as happy with\\n     him as i once used to think i might be with you;\\n     but i scorn to accept a hand while the heart was\\n     another\\'s.  sincerely wish you happy in your choice,\\n     and it shall not be my fault if we are not always\\n     good friends, as our near relationship now makes\\n     proper.  i can safely say i owe you no ill-will,\\n     and am sure you will be too generous to do us any\\n     ill offices.  your brother has gained my affections\\n     entirely, and as we could not live without one\\n     another, we are just returned from the altar, and\\n     are now on our way to dawlish for a few weeks, which\\n     place your dear brother has great curiosity to see,\\n     but thought i would first trouble you with these\\n     few lines, and shall always remain,\\n\\n     \"your sincere well-wisher, friend, and sister,\\n                                        \"lucy ferrars.\\n\\n     \"i have burnt all your letters, and will return\\n     your picture the first opportunity.  please to destroy\\n     my scrawls--but the ring with my hair you are very\\n     welcome to keep.\"\\n\\nelinor read and returned it without any comment.\\n\\n\"i will not ask your opinion of it as a composition,\"\\nsaid edward.--\"for worlds would not i have had a letter\\nof hers seen by you in former days.--in a sister it\\nis bad enough, but in a wife!--how i have blushed over\\nthe pages of her writing!--and i believe i may say that\\nsince the first half year of our foolish--business--this\\nis the only letter i ever received from her, of which\\nthe substance made me any amends for the defect of the style.\"\\n\\n\"however it may have come about,\" said elinor,\\nafter a pause,--\"they are certainly married.  and your mother\\nhas brought on herself a most appropriate punishment.\\nthe independence she settled on robert, through resentment\\nagainst you, has put it in his power to make his own choice;\\nand she has actually been bribing one son with a thousand\\na-year, to do the very deed which she disinherited the\\nother for intending to do.  she will hardly be less hurt,\\ni suppose, by robert\\'s marrying lucy, than she would have\\nbeen by your marrying her.\"\\n\\n\"she will be more hurt by it, for robert always\\nwas her favourite.--she will be more hurt by it,\\nand on the same principle will forgive him much sooner.\"\\n\\nin what state the affair stood at present between them,\\nedward knew not, for no communication with any of his family\\nhad yet been attempted by him.  he had quitted oxford\\nwithin four and twenty hours after lucy\\'s letter arrived,\\nand with only one object before him, the nearest road\\nto barton, had had no leisure to form any scheme of conduct,\\nwith which that road did not hold the most intimate connection.\\nhe could do nothing till he were assured of his fate with\\nmiss dashwood; and by his rapidity in seeking that fate,\\nit is to be supposed, in spite of the jealousy with\\nwhich he had once thought of colonel brandon, in spite\\nof the modesty with which he rated his own deserts,\\nand the politeness with which he talked of his doubts,\\nhe did not, upon the whole, expect a very cruel reception.\\nit was his business, however, to say that he did, and he\\nsaid it very prettily.  what he might say on the subject\\na twelvemonth after, must be referred to the imagination\\nof husbands and wives.\\n\\nthat lucy had certainly meant to deceive, to go off\\nwith a flourish of malice against him in her message\\nby thomas, was perfectly clear to elinor; and edward himself,\\nnow thoroughly enlightened on her character, had no\\nscruple in believing her capable of the utmost meanness\\nof wanton ill-nature. though his eyes had been long opened,\\neven before his acquaintance with elinor began, to her\\nignorance and a want of liberality in some of her opinions--\\nthey had been equally imputed, by him, to her want\\nof education; and till her last letter reached him,\\nhe had always believed her to be a well-disposed,\\ngood-hearted girl, and thoroughly attached to himself.\\nnothing but such a persuasion could have prevented\\nhis putting an end to an engagement, which, long before\\nthe discovery of it laid him open to his mother\\'s anger,\\nhad been a continual source of disquiet and regret to him.\\n\\n\"i thought it my duty,\" said he, \"independent of my feelings,\\nto give her the option of continuing the engagement or not,\\nwhen i was renounced by my mother, and stood to all\\nappearance without a friend in the world to assist me.\\nin such a situation as that, where there seemed nothing\\nto tempt the avarice or the vanity of any living creature,\\nhow could i suppose, when she so earnestly, so warmly insisted\\non sharing my fate, whatever it might be, that any thing\\nbut the most disinterested affection was her inducement?\\nand even now, i cannot comprehend on what motive she acted,\\nor what fancied advantage it could be to her, to be\\nfettered to a man for whom she had not the smallest regard,\\nand who had only two thousand pounds in the world.\\nshe could not foresee that colonel brandon would give me a\\nliving.\"\\n\\n\"no; but she might suppose that something would occur\\nin your favour; that your own family might in time relent.\\nand at any rate, she lost nothing by continuing the engagement,\\nfor she has proved that it fettered neither her inclination\\nnor her actions.  the connection was certainly a\\nrespectable one, and probably gained her consideration among\\nher friends; and, if nothing more advantageous occurred,\\nit would be better for her to marry you than be single.\"\\n\\nedward was, of course, immediately convinced that\\nnothing could have been more natural than lucy\\'s conduct,\\nnor more self-evident than the motive of it.\\n\\nelinor scolded him, harshly as ladies always scold\\nthe imprudence which compliments themselves, for having\\nspent so much time with them at norland, when he must\\nhave felt his own inconstancy.\\n\\n\"your behaviour was certainly very wrong,\" said she;\\n\"because--to say nothing of my own conviction, our relations\\nwere all led away by it to fancy and expect what, as you\\nwere then situated, could never be.\"\\n\\nhe could only plead an ignorance of his own heart,\\nand a mistaken confidence in the force of his engagement.\\n\\n\"i was simple enough to think, that because my faith\\nwas plighted to another, there could be no danger in my being\\nwith you; and that the consciousness of my engagement was\\nto keep my heart as safe and sacred as my honour.  i felt\\nthat i admired you, but i told myself it was only friendship;\\nand till i began to make comparisons between yourself\\nand lucy, i did not know how far i was got.  after that,\\ni suppose, i was wrong in remaining so much in sussex,\\nand the arguments with which i reconciled myself to the\\nexpediency of it, were no better than these:--the danger\\nis my own; i am doing no injury to anybody but myself.\"\\n\\nelinor smiled, and shook her head.\\n\\nedward heard with pleasure of colonel brandon\\'s\\nbeing expected at the cottage, as he really wished\\nnot only to be better acquainted with him, but to have an\\nopportunity of convincing him that he no longer resented\\nhis giving him the living of delaford--\"which, at present,\"\\nsaid he, \"after thanks so ungraciously delivered as mine\\nwere on the occasion, he must think i have never forgiven\\nhim for offering.\"\\n\\nnow he felt astonished himself that he had never yet\\nbeen to the place.  but so little interest had be taken\\nin the matter, that he owed all his knowledge of the house,\\ngarden, and glebe, extent of the parish, condition of\\nthe land, and rate of the tithes, to elinor herself,\\nwho had heard so much of it from colonel brandon,\\nand heard it with so much attention, as to be entirely\\nmistress of the subject.\\n\\none question after this only remained undecided,\\nbetween them, one difficulty only was to be overcome.\\nthey were brought together by mutual affection,\\nwith the warmest approbation of their real friends;\\ntheir intimate knowledge of each other seemed to make\\ntheir happiness certain--and they only wanted something\\nto live upon.  edward had two thousand pounds, and elinor\\none, which, with delaford living, was all that they could\\ncall their own; for it was impossible that mrs. dashwood\\nshould advance anything; and they were neither of them\\nquite enough in love to think that three hundred and fifty\\npounds a-year would supply them with the comforts of life.\\n\\nedward was not entirely without hopes of some\\nfavourable change in his mother towards him; and on that\\nhe rested for the residue of their income.  but elinor\\nhad no such dependence; for since edward would still\\nbe unable to marry miss morton, and his chusing herself\\nhad been spoken of in mrs. ferrars\\'s flattering language\\nas only a lesser evil than his chusing lucy steele,\\nshe feared that robert\\'s offence would serve no other\\npurpose than to enrich fanny.\\n\\nabout four days after edward\\'s arrival colonel\\nbrandon appeared, to complete mrs. dashwood\\'s satisfaction,\\nand to give her the dignity of having, for the first time\\nsince her living at barton, more company with her than\\nher house would hold.  edward was allowed to retain the\\nprivilege of first comer, and colonel brandon therefore\\nwalked every night to his old quarters at the park;\\nfrom whence he usually returned in the morning, early enough\\nto interrupt the lovers\\' first tete-a-tete before breakfast.\\n\\na three weeks\\' residence at delaford, where,\\nin his evening hours at least, he had little to do\\nbut to calculate the disproportion between thirty-six\\nand seventeen, brought him to barton in a temper of mind\\nwhich needed all the improvement in marianne\\'s looks,\\nall the kindness of her welcome, and all the encouragement\\nof her mother\\'s language, to make it cheerful.\\namong such friends, however, and such flattery, he did revive.\\nno rumour of lucy\\'s marriage had yet reached him:--he knew\\nnothing of what had passed; and the first hours of his\\nvisit were consequently spent in hearing and in wondering.\\nevery thing was explained to him by mrs. dashwood,\\nand he found fresh reason to rejoice in what he had done\\nfor mr. ferrars, since eventually it promoted the interest\\nof elinor.\\n\\nit would be needless to say, that the gentlemen advanced\\nin the good opinion of each other, as they advanced in each\\nother\\'s acquaintance, for it could not be otherwise.\\ntheir resemblance in good principles and good sense,\\nin disposition and manner of thinking, would probably\\nhave been sufficient to unite them in friendship,\\nwithout any other attraction; but their being in love\\nwith two sisters, and two sisters fond of each other,\\nmade that mutual regard inevitable and immediate,\\nwhich might otherwise have waited the effect of time\\nand judgment.\\n\\nthe letters from town, which a few days before would\\nhave made every nerve in elinor\\'s body thrill with transport,\\nnow arrived to be read with less emotion that mirth.\\nmrs. jennings wrote to tell the wonderful tale, to vent her\\nhonest indignation against the jilting girl, and pour forth\\nher compassion towards poor mr. edward, who, she was sure,\\nhad quite doted upon the worthless hussy, and was now,\\nby all accounts, almost broken-hearted, at oxford.--\\n\"i do think,\" she continued, \"nothing was ever carried\\non so sly; for it was but two days before lucy called\\nand sat a couple of hours with me.  not a soul suspected\\nanything of the matter, not even nancy, who, poor soul!\\ncame crying to me the day after, in a great fright\\nfor fear of mrs. ferrars, as well as not knowing how to\\nget to plymouth; for lucy it seems borrowed all her\\nmoney before she went off to be married, on purpose\\nwe suppose to make a show with, and poor nancy had not\\nseven shillings in the world;--so i was very glad to give\\nher five guineas to take her down to exeter, where she\\nthinks of staying three or four weeks with mrs. burgess,\\nin hopes, as i tell her, to fall in with the doctor again.\\nand i must say that lucy\\'s crossness not to take them\\nalong with them in the chaise is worse than all.\\npoor mr. edward! i cannot get him out of my head, but you\\nmust send for him to barton, and miss marianne must try to\\ncomfort him.\"\\n\\nmr. dashwood\\'s strains were more solemn.\\nmrs. ferrars was the most unfortunate of women--poor\\nfanny had suffered agonies of sensibility--and he\\nconsidered the existence of each, under such a blow,\\nwith grateful wonder.  robert\\'s offence was unpardonable,\\nbut lucy\\'s was infinitely worse.  neither of them were\\never again to be mentioned to mrs. ferrars; and even,\\nif she might hereafter be induced to forgive her son,\\nhis wife should never be acknowledged as her daughter,\\nnor be permitted to appear in her presence.  the secrecy\\nwith which everything had been carried on between them,\\nwas rationally treated as enormously heightening\\nthe crime, because, had any suspicion of it occurred\\nto the others, proper measures would have been taken\\nto prevent the marriage; and he called on elinor to join\\nwith him in regretting that lucy\\'s engagement with edward\\nhad not rather been fulfilled, than that she should thus\\nbe the means of spreading misery farther in the family.--\\nhe thus continued:\\n\\n\"mrs. ferrars has never yet mentioned edward\\'s name,\\nwhich does not surprise us; but, to our great astonishment,\\nnot a line has been received from him on the occasion.\\nperhaps, however, he is kept silent by his fear of offending,\\nand i shall, therefore, give him a hint, by a line\\nto oxford, that his sister and i both think a letter\\nof proper submission from him, addressed perhaps to fanny,\\nand by her shewn to her mother, might not be taken amiss;\\nfor we all know the tenderness of mrs. ferrars\\'s heart,\\nand that she wishes for nothing so much as to be on good terms\\nwith her children.\"\\n\\nthis paragraph was of some importance to the\\nprospects and conduct of edward.  it determined him\\nto attempt a reconciliation, though not exactly\\nin the manner pointed out by their brother and sister.\\n\\n\"a letter of proper submission!\" repeated he;\\n\"would they have me beg my mother\\'s pardon for robert\\'s\\ningratitude to her, and breach of honour to me?--i can\\nmake no submission--i am grown neither humble nor\\npenitent by what has passed.--i am grown very happy;\\nbut that would not interest.--i know of no submission\\nthat is proper for me to make.\"\\n\\n\"you may certainly ask to be forgiven,\" said elinor,\\n\"because you have offended;--and i should think you\\nmight now venture so far as to profess some concern\\nfor having ever formed the engagement which drew on you\\nyour mother\\'s anger.\"\\n\\nhe agreed that he might.\\n\\n\"and when she has forgiven you, perhaps a little humility\\nmay be convenient while acknowledging a second engagement,\\nalmost as imprudent in her eyes as the first.\"\\n\\nhe had nothing to urge against it, but still\\nresisted the idea of a letter of proper submission;\\nand therefore, to make it easier to him, as he declared\\na much greater willingness to make mean concessions\\nby word of mouth than on paper, it was resolved that,\\ninstead of writing to fanny, he should go to london,\\nand personally intreat her good offices in his favour.--\\n\"and if they really do interest themselves,\" said marianne,\\nin her new character of candour, \"in bringing about\\na reconciliation, i shall think that even john and fanny\\nare not entirely without merit.\"\\n\\nafter a visit on colonel brandon\\'s side of only three\\nor four days, the two gentlemen quitted barton together.--\\nthey were to go immediately to delaford, that edward\\nmight have some personal knowledge of his future home,\\nand assist his patron and friend in deciding on what\\nimprovements were needed to it; and from thence,\\nafter staying there a couple of nights, he was to proceed\\non his journey to town.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 50\\n\\n\\nafter a proper resistance on the part of mrs. ferrars,\\njust so violent and so steady as to preserve her from that\\nreproach which she always seemed fearful of incurring,\\nthe reproach of being too amiable, edward was admitted\\nto her presence, and pronounced to be again her son.\\n\\nher family had of late been exceedingly fluctuating.\\nfor many years of her life she had had two sons;\\nbut the crime and annihilation of edward a few weeks ago,\\nhad robbed her of one; the similar annihilation of robert\\nhad left her for a fortnight without any; and now,\\nby the resuscitation of edward, she had one again.\\n\\nin spite of his being allowed once more to live,\\nhowever, he did not feel the continuance of his existence\\nsecure, till he had revealed his present engagement;\\nfor the publication of that circumstance, he feared,\\nmight give a sudden turn to his constitution, and carry\\nhim off as rapidly as before.  with apprehensive caution\\ntherefore it was revealed, and he was listened to with\\nunexpected calmness.  mrs. ferrars at first reasonably\\nendeavoured to dissuade him from marrying miss dashwood,\\nby every argument in her power;--told him, that in miss morton\\nhe would have a woman of higher rank and larger fortune;--\\nand enforced the assertion, by observing that miss morton\\nwas the daughter of a nobleman with thirty thousand pounds,\\nwhile miss dashwood was only the daughter of a private\\ngentleman with no more than three; but when she found that,\\nthough perfectly admitting the truth of her representation,\\nhe was by no means inclined to be guided by it,\\nshe judged it wisest, from the experience of the past,\\nto submit--and therefore, after such an ungracious delay\\nas she owed to her own dignity, and as served to prevent\\nevery suspicion of good-will, she issued her decree\\nof consent to the marriage of edward and elinor.\\n\\nwhat she would engage to do towards augmenting\\ntheir income was next to be considered; and here it\\nplainly appeared, that though edward was now her only son,\\nhe was by no means her eldest; for while robert was\\ninevitably endowed with a thousand pounds a-year,\\nnot the smallest objection was made against edward\\'s taking\\norders for the sake of two hundred and fifty at the utmost;\\nnor was anything promised either for the present or in future,\\nbeyond the ten thousand pounds, which had been given with fanny.\\n\\nit was as much, however, as was desired,\\nand more than was expected, by edward and elinor;\\nand mrs. ferrars herself, by her shuffling excuses,\\nseemed the only person surprised at her not giving more.\\n\\nwith an income quite sufficient to their wants\\nthus secured to them, they had nothing to wait for\\nafter edward was in possession of the living, but the\\nreadiness of the house, to which colonel brandon,\\nwith an eager desire for the accommodation of elinor,\\nwas making considerable improvements; and after waiting\\nsome time for their completion, after experiencing,\\nas usual, a thousand disappointments and delays\\nfrom the unaccountable dilatoriness of the workmen, elinor,\\nas usual, broke through the first positive resolution\\nof not marrying till every thing was ready, and the\\nceremony took place in barton church early in the autumn.\\n\\nthe first month after their marriage was spent\\nwith their friend at the mansion-house; from whence\\nthey could superintend the progress of the parsonage,\\nand direct every thing as they liked on the spot;--\\ncould chuse papers, project shrubberies, and invent a sweep.\\nmrs. jennings\\'s prophecies, though rather jumbled together,\\nwere chiefly fulfilled; for she was able to visit edward\\nand his wife in their parsonage by michaelmas, and she\\nfound in elinor and her husband, as she really believed,\\none of the happiest couples in the world.  they had\\nin fact nothing to wish for, but the marriage of colonel\\nbrandon and marianne, and rather better pasturage for\\ntheir cows.\\n\\nthey were visited on their first settling by almost\\nall their relations and friends.  mrs. ferrars came\\nto inspect the happiness which she was almost ashamed\\nof having authorised; and even the dashwoods were at\\nthe expense of a journey from sussex to do them honour.\\n\\n\"i will not say that i am disappointed, my dear sister,\"\\nsaid john, as they were walking together one morning before\\nthe gates of delaford house, \"that would be saying too much,\\nfor certainly you have been one of the most fortunate young\\nwomen in the world, as it is.  but, i confess, it would\\ngive me great pleasure to call colonel brandon brother.\\nhis property here, his place, his house, every thing is in\\nsuch respectable and excellent condition!--and his woods!--i\\nhave not seen such timber any where in dorsetshire, as there\\nis now standing in delaford hanger!--and though, perhaps,\\nmarianne may not seem exactly the person to attract him--\\nyet i think it would altogether be advisable for you to\\nhave them now frequently staying with you, for as colonel\\nbrandon seems a great deal at home, nobody can tell what\\nmay happen--for, when people are much thrown together,\\nand see little of anybody else--and it will always be\\nin your power to set her off to advantage, and so forth;--\\nin short, you may as well give her a chance--you understand\\nme.\"--\\n\\nbut though mrs. ferrars did come to see them, and always\\ntreated them with the make-believe of decent affection,\\nthey were never insulted by her real favour and preference.\\nthat was due to the folly of robert, and the cunning\\nof his wife; and it was earned by them before many months\\nhad passed away.  the selfish sagacity of the latter,\\nwhich had at first drawn robert into the scrape,\\nwas the principal instrument of his deliverance from it;\\nfor her respectful humility, assiduous attentions,\\nand endless flatteries, as soon as the smallest opening\\nwas given for their exercise, reconciled mrs. ferrars\\nto his choice, and re-established him completely in\\nher favour.\\n\\nthe whole of lucy\\'s behaviour in the affair,\\nand the prosperity which crowned it, therefore, may be held\\nforth as a most encouraging instance of what an earnest,\\nan unceasing attention to self-interest, however its progress\\nmay be apparently obstructed, will do in securing every\\nadvantage of fortune, with no other sacrifice than that of time\\nand conscience.  when robert first sought her acquaintance,\\nand privately visited her in bartlett\\'s buildings,\\nit was only with the view imputed to him by his brother.\\nhe merely meant to persuade her to give up the engagement;\\nand as there could be nothing to overcome but the affection\\nof both, he naturally expected that one or two interviews\\nwould settle the matter.  in that point, however,\\nand that only, he erred;--for though lucy soon gave him\\nhopes that his eloquence would convince her in time,\\nanother visit, another conversation, was always wanted\\nto produce this conviction.  some doubts always lingered\\nin her mind when they parted, which could only be\\nremoved by another half hour\\'s discourse with himself.\\nhis attendance was by this means secured, and the rest\\nfollowed in course.  instead of talking of edward,\\nthey came gradually to talk only of robert,--a subject\\non which he had always more to say than on any other,\\nand in which she soon betrayed an interest even equal\\nto his own; and in short, it became speedily evident\\nto both, that he had entirely supplanted his brother.\\nhe was proud of his conquest, proud of tricking edward,\\nand very proud of marrying privately without his\\nmother\\'s consent.  what immediately followed is known.\\nthey passed some months in great happiness at dawlish;\\nfor she had many relations and old acquaintances to\\ncut--and he drew several plans for magnificent cottages;--\\nand from thence returning to town, procured the forgiveness\\nof mrs. ferrars, by the simple expedient of asking it,\\nwhich, at lucy\\'s instigation, was adopted.  the forgiveness,\\nat first, indeed, as was reasonable, comprehended only robert;\\nand lucy, who had owed his mother no duty and therefore\\ncould have transgressed none, still remained some weeks\\nlonger unpardoned.  but perseverance in humility of conduct\\nand messages, in self-condemnation for robert\\'s offence,\\nand gratitude for the unkindness she was treated with,\\nprocured her in time the haughty notice which overcame\\nher by its graciousness, and led soon afterwards, by rapid\\ndegrees, to the highest state of affection and influence.\\nlucy became as necessary to mrs. ferrars, as either robert\\nor fanny; and while edward was never cordially forgiven\\nfor having once intended to marry her, and elinor,\\nthough superior to her in fortune and birth, was spoken\\nof as an intruder, she was in every thing considered,\\nand always openly acknowledged, to be a favourite child.\\nthey settled in town, received very liberal assistance\\nfrom mrs. ferrars, were on the best terms imaginable\\nwith the dashwoods; and setting aside the jealousies\\nand ill-will continually subsisting between fanny and lucy,\\nin which their husbands of course took a part, as well\\nas the frequent domestic disagreements between robert and\\nlucy themselves, nothing could exceed the harmony in which\\nthey all lived together.\\n\\nwhat edward had done to forfeit the right of eldest\\nson, might have puzzled many people to find out; and what\\nrobert had done to succeed to it, might have puzzled them\\nstill more.  it was an arrangement, however, justified in\\nits effects, if not in its cause; for nothing ever\\nappeared in robert\\'s style of living or of talking to give\\na suspicion of his regretting the extent of his income,\\nas either leaving his brother too little, or bringing\\nhimself too much;--and if edward might be judged from\\nthe ready discharge of his duties in every particular,\\nfrom an increasing attachment to his wife and his home,\\nand from the regular cheerfulness of his spirits,\\nhe might be supposed no less contented with his lot,\\nno less free from every wish of an exchange.\\n\\nelinor\\'s marriage divided her as little from her\\nfamily as could well be contrived, without rendering\\nthe cottage at barton entirely useless, for her mother\\nand sisters spent much more than half their time with her.\\nmrs. dashwood was acting on motives of policy as well\\nas pleasure in the frequency of her visits at delaford;\\nfor her wish of bringing marianne and colonel brandon together\\nwas hardly less earnest, though rather more liberal than\\nwhat john had expressed.  it was now her darling object.\\nprecious as was the company of her daughter to her,\\nshe desired nothing so much as to give up its constant\\nenjoyment to her valued friend; and to see marianne settled at\\nthe mansion-house was equally the wish of edward and elinor.\\nthey each felt his sorrows, and their own obligations,\\nand marianne, by general consent, was to be the reward\\nof all.\\n\\nwith such a confederacy against her--with a knowledge\\nso intimate of his goodness--with a conviction of his fond\\nattachment to herself, which at last, though long after it\\nwas observable to everybody else--burst on her--what could she\\ndo?\\n\\nmarianne dashwood was born to an extraordinary fate.\\nshe was born to discover the falsehood of her own opinions,\\nand to counteract, by her conduct, her most favourite maxims.\\nshe was born to overcome an affection formed so late\\nin life as at seventeen, and with no sentiment\\nsuperior to strong esteem and lively friendship,\\nvoluntarily to give her hand to another!--and that other,\\na man who had suffered no less than herself under the\\nevent of a former attachment, whom, two years before,\\nshe had considered too old to be married,--and who still\\nsought the constitutional safeguard of a flannel waistcoat!\\n\\nbut so it was.  instead of falling a sacrifice\\nto an irresistible passion, as once she had fondly\\nflattered herself with expecting,--instead of remaining\\neven for ever with her mother, and finding her only\\npleasures in retirement and study, as afterwards in her\\nmore calm and sober judgment she had determined on,--\\nshe found herself at nineteen, submitting to new attachments,\\nentering on new duties, placed in a new home, a wife,\\nthe mistress of a family, and the patroness of a village.\\n\\ncolonel brandon was now as happy, as all those who best\\nloved him, believed he deserved to be;--in marianne he\\nwas consoled for every past affliction;--her regard and her\\nsociety restored his mind to animation, and his spirits\\nto cheerfulness; and that marianne found her own happiness\\nin forming his, was equally the persuasion and delight\\nof each observing friend.  marianne could never love\\nby halves; and her whole heart became, in time, as much\\ndevoted to her husband, as it had once been to willoughby.\\n\\nwilloughby could not hear of her marriage without\\na pang; and his punishment was soon afterwards complete\\nin the voluntary forgiveness of mrs. smith, who, by stating\\nhis marriage with a woman of character, as the source\\nof her clemency, gave him reason for believing that had he\\nbehaved with honour towards marianne, he might at once have\\nbeen happy and rich.  that his repentance of misconduct,\\nwhich thus brought its own punishment, was sincere,\\nneed not be doubted;--nor that he long thought of colonel\\nbrandon with envy, and of marianne with regret.  but that\\nhe was for ever inconsolable, that he fled from society,\\nor contracted an habitual gloom of temper, or died of a\\nbroken heart, must not be depended on--for he did neither.\\nhe lived to exert, and frequently to enjoy himself.\\nhis wife was not always out of humour, nor his home\\nalways uncomfortable; and in his breed of horses and dogs,\\nand in sporting of every kind, he found no inconsiderable\\ndegree of domestic felicity.\\n\\nfor marianne, however--in spite of his incivility\\nin surviving her loss--he always retained that decided\\nregard which interested him in every thing that befell her,\\nand made her his secret standard of perfection in woman;--\\nand many a rising beauty would be slighted by him in\\nafter-days as bearing no comparison with mrs. brandon.\\n\\nmrs. dashwood was prudent enough to remain at the cottage,\\nwithout attempting a removal to delaford; and fortunately for\\nsir john and mrs. jennings, when marianne was taken from them,\\nmargaret had reached an age highly suitable for dancing,\\nand not very ineligible for being supposed to have a lover.\\n\\nbetween barton and delaford, there was that constant\\ncommunication which strong family affection would\\nnaturally dictate;--and among the merits and the happiness\\nof elinor and marianne, let it not be ranked as the least\\nconsiderable, that though sisters, and living almost within\\nsight of each other, they could live without disagreement\\nbetween themselves, or producing coolness between their husbands.\\n\\nthe end\\n\\n\\n'"

intended\\nto bequeath it  in the society of his nephew and niece\\nand their children the old gentlemans days were\\ncomfortably spent  his attachment to them all increased\\nthe constant attention of mr and mrs henry dashwood\\nto his wishes which proceeded not merely from interest\\nbut from goodness of heart gave him every degree of solid\\ncomfort which his age could receive and the cheerfulness\\nof the children added a relish to his existence\\n\\nby a former marriage mr henry dashwood had one\\nson by his present lady three daughters  the son\\na steady respectable young man was amply provided\\nfor by the fortune of his mother which had been large\\nand half of which devolved on him on his coming of age\\nby his own marriage likewise which happened soon afterwards\\nhe added to his wealth  to him therefore the succession\\nto the norland estate was not so really important as to\\nhis sisters for their fortune independent of what might\\narise to them from their fathers inheriting that property\\ncould be but small  their mother had nothing and their\\nfather only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal\\nfor the remaining moiety of his first wifes fortune was\\nalso secured to her child and he had only a lifeinterest\\nin it\\n\\nthe old gentleman died his will was read and\\nlike almost every other will gave as much disappointment\\nas pleasure  he was neither so unjust nor so ungrateful\\nas to leave his estate from his nephewbut he left it to him\\non such terms as destroyed half the value of the bequest\\nmr dashwood had wished for it more for the sake of his\\nwife and daughters than for himself or his sonbut to\\nhis son and his sons son a child of four years old\\nit was secured in such a way as to leave to himself\\nno power of providing for those who were most dear\\nto him and who most needed a provision by any charge\\non the estate or by any sale of its valuable woods\\nthe whole was tied up for the benefit of this child who\\nin occasional visits with his father and mother at norland\\nhad so far gained on the affections of his uncle\\nby such attractions as are by no means unusual in children\\nof two or three years old an imperfect articulation\\nan earnest desire of having his own way many cunning tricks\\nand a great deal of noise as to outweigh all the value\\nof all the attention which for years he had received\\nfrom his niece and her daughters  he meant not to\\nbe unkind however and as a mark of his affection\\nfor the three girls he left them a thousand pounds apiece\\n\\nmr dashwoods disappointment was at first severe\\nbut his temper was cheerful and sanguine and he might\\nreasonably hope to live many years and by living economically\\nlay by a considerable sum from the produce of an estate\\nalready large and capable of almost immediate improvement\\nbut the fortune which had been so tardy in coming was his\\nonly one twelvemonth  he survived his uncle no longer\\nand ten thousand pounds including the late legacies\\nwas all that remained for his widow and daughters\\n\\nhis son was sent for as soon as his danger was known\\nand to him mr dashwood recommended with all the strength\\nand urgency which illness could command the interest\\nof his motherinlaw and sisters\\n\\nmr john dashwood had not the strong feelings of the\\nrest of the family but he was affected by a recommendation\\nof such a nature at such a time and he promised to do\\nevery thing in his power to make them comfortable\\nhis father was rendered easy by such an assurance\\nand mr john dashwood had then leisure to consider how\\nmuch there might prudently be in his power to do for them\\n\\nhe was not an illdisposed young man unless to\\nbe rather cold hearted and rather selfish is to be\\nilldisposed but he was in general well respected\\nfor he conducted himself with propriety in the discharge\\nof his ordinary duties  had he married a more amiable woman\\nhe might have been made still more respectable than he\\nwashe might even have been made amiable himself for he\\nwas very young when he married and very fond of his wife\\nbut mrs john dashwood was a strong caricature of himself\\nmore narrowminded and selfish\\n\\nwhen he gave his promise to his father he meditated\\nwithin himself to increase the fortunes of his sisters\\nby the present of a thousand pounds apiece  he then\\nreally thought himself equal to it  the prospect of four\\nthousand ayear in addition to his present income\\nbesides the remaining half of his own mothers fortune\\nwarmed his heart and made him feel capable of generosity\\nyes he would give them three thousand pounds it would\\nbe liberal and handsome it would be enough to make\\nthem completely easy  three thousand pounds he could\\nspare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience\\nhe thought of it all day long and for many days successively\\nand he did not repent\\n\\nno sooner was his fathers funeral over than mrs john\\ndashwood without sending any notice of her intention to her\\nmotherinlaw arrived with her child and their attendants\\nno one could dispute her right to come the house was\\nher husbands from the moment of his fathers decease\\nbut the indelicacy of her conduct was so much the greater\\nand to a woman in mrs dashwoods situation with only\\ncommon feelings must have been highly unpleasing\\nbut in her mind there was a sense of honor so keen\\na generosity so romantic that any offence of the kind\\nby whomsoever given or received was to her a source\\nof immoveable disgust  mrs john dashwood had never\\nbeen a favourite with any of her husbands family\\nbut she had had no opportunity till the present\\nof shewing them with how little attention to the comfort\\nof other people she could act when occasion required it\\n\\nso acutely did mrs dashwood feel this ungracious\\nbehaviour and so earnestly did she despise her\\ndaughterinlaw for it that on the arrival of the latter\\nshe would have quitted the house for ever had not the\\nentreaty of her eldest girl induced her first to reflect\\non the propriety of going and her own tender love for all\\nher three children determined her afterwards to stay\\nand for their sakes avoid a breach with their brother\\n\\nelinor this eldest daughter whose advice was\\nso effectual possessed a strength of understanding\\nand coolness of judgment which qualified her\\nthough only nineteen to be the counsellor of her mother\\nand enabled her frequently to counteract to the advantage\\nof them all that eagerness of mind in mrs dashwood\\nwhich must generally have led to imprudence  she had\\nan excellent hearther disposition was affectionate\\nand her feelings were strong but she knew how to govern\\nthem it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn\\nand which one of her sisters had resolved never to be taught\\n\\nmariannes abilities were in many respects\\nquite equal to elinors she was sensible and clever\\nbut eager in everything her sorrows her joys could have\\nno moderation  she was generous amiable interesting she\\nwas everything but prudent  the resemblance between\\nher and her mother was strikingly great\\n\\nelinor saw with concern the excess of her\\nsisters sensibility but by mrs dashwood it was valued\\nand cherished  they encouraged each other now in the\\nviolence of their affliction  the agony of grief\\nwhich overpowered them at first was voluntarily renewed\\nwas sought for was created again and again  they gave\\nthemselves up wholly to their sorrow seeking increase\\nof wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it\\nand resolved against ever admitting consolation\\nin future  elinor too was deeply afflicted but still\\nshe could struggle she could exert herself  she could\\nconsult with her brother could receive her sisterinlaw\\non her arrival and treat her with proper attention\\nand could strive to rouse her mother to similar exertion\\nand encourage her to similar forbearance\\n\\nmargaret the other sister was a goodhumored\\nwelldisposed girl but as she had already imbibed\\na good deal of mariannes romance without having\\nmuch of her sense she did not at thirteen bid fair\\nto equal her sisters at a more advanced period of life\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 2\\n\\n\\nmrs john dashwood now installed herself mistress\\nof norland and her mother and sistersinlaw were degraded\\nto the condition of visitors  as such however they were\\ntreated by her with quiet civility and by her husband\\nwith as much kindness as he could feel towards anybody\\nbeyond himself his wife and their child  he really\\npressed them with some earnestness to consider norland\\nas their home and as no plan appeared so eligible\\nto mrs dashwood as remaining there till she could\\naccommodate herself with a house in the neighbourhood\\nhis invitation was accepted\\n\\na continuance in a place where everything reminded\\nher of former delight was exactly what suited her mind\\nin seasons of cheerfulness no temper could be more cheerful\\nthan hers or possess in a greater degree that sanguine\\nexpectation of happiness which is happiness itself\\nbut in sorrow she must be equally carried away by her fancy\\nand as far beyond consolation as in pleasure she was\\nbeyond alloy\\n\\nmrs john dashwood did not at all approve of what her\\nhusband intended to do for his sisters  to take three\\nthousand pounds from the fortune of their dear little boy\\nwould be impoverishing him to the most dreadful degree\\nshe begged him to think again on the subject  how could\\nhe answer it to himself to rob his child and his only\\nchild too of so large a sum  and what possible claim\\ncould the miss dashwoods who were related to him only by\\nhalf blood which she considered as no relationship at all\\nhave on his generosity to so large an amount  it was very\\nwell known that no affection was ever supposed to exist\\nbetween the children of any man by different marriages\\nand why was he to ruin himself and their poor little harry\\nby giving away all his money to his half sisters\\n\\nit was my fathers last request to me replied\\nher husband that i should assist his widow and daughters\\n\\nhe did not know what he was talking of i dare say\\nten to one but he was lightheaded at the time\\nhad he been in his right senses he could not have thought\\nof such a thing as begging you to give away half your\\nfortune from your own child\\n\\nhe did not stipulate for any particular sum\\nmy dear fanny he only requested me in general terms\\nto assist them and make their situation more comfortable\\nthan it was in his power to do  perhaps it would\\nhave been as well if he had left it wholly to myself\\nhe could hardly suppose i should neglect them\\nbut as he required the promise i could not do less\\nthan give it at least i thought so at the time\\nthe promise therefore was given and must be performed\\nsomething must be done for them whenever they leave norland\\nand settle in a new home\\n\\nwell then let something be done for them\\nbut that something need not be three thousand pounds\\nconsider she added that when the money is once\\nparted with it never can return  your sisters will marry\\nand it will be gone for ever  if indeed it could\\nbe restored to our poor little boy\\n\\nwhy to be sure said her husband very gravely\\nthat would make great difference  the time may come when\\nharry will regret that so large a sum was parted with\\nif he should have a numerous family for instance it would\\nbe a very convenient addition\\n\\nto be sure it would\\n\\nperhaps then it would be better for all parties\\nif the sum were diminished one halffive hundred pounds\\nwould be a prodigious increase to their fortunes\\n\\noh beyond anything great  what brother on earth\\nwould do half so much for his sisters even if really\\nhis sisters  and as it isonly half bloodbut you\\nhave such a generous spirit\\n\\ni would not wish to do any thing mean he replied\\none had rather on such occasions do too much than\\ntoo little  no one at least can think i have not\\ndone enough for them even themselves they can hardly\\nexpect more\\n\\nthere is no knowing what they may expect\\nsaid the lady but we are not to think of their\\nexpectations the question is what you can afford to do\\n\\ncertainlyand i think i may afford to give them five\\nhundred pounds apiece  as it is without any addition\\nof mine they will each have about three thousand pounds\\non their mothers deatha very comfortable fortune\\nfor any young woman\\n\\nto be sure it is and indeed it strikes me that\\nthey can want no addition at all  they will have ten\\nthousand pounds divided amongst them  if they marry\\nthey will be sure of doing well and if they do not\\nthey may all live very comfortably together on the interest\\nof ten thousand pounds\\n\\nthat is very true and therefore i do not know whether\\nupon the whole it would not be more advisable to do\\nsomething for their mother while she lives rather than\\nfor themsomething of the annuity kind i meanmy sisters\\nwould feel the good effects of it as well as herself\\na hundred a year would make them all perfectly comfortable\\n\\nhis wife hesitated a little however in giving\\nher consent to this plan\\n\\nto be sure said she it is better than parting with\\nfifteen hundred pounds at once  but then if mrs dashwood\\nshould live fifteen years we shall be completely taken in\\n\\nfifteen years my dear fanny her life cannot\\nbe worth half that purchase\\n\\ncertainly not but if you observe people always\\nlive for ever when there is an annuity to be paid them\\nand she is very stout and healthy and hardly forty\\nan annuity is a very serious business it comes over\\nand over every year and there is no getting rid\\nof it  you are not aware of what you are doing\\ni have known a great deal of the trouble of annuities\\nfor my mother was clogged with the payment of three\\nto old superannuated servants by my fathers will\\nand it is amazing how disagreeable she found it\\ntwice every year these annuities were to be paid and then\\nthere was the trouble of getting it to them and then one\\nof them was said to have died and afterwards it turned\\nout to be no such thing  my mother was quite sick of it\\nher income was not her own she said with such perpetual\\nclaims on it and it was the more unkind in my father\\nbecause otherwise the money would have been entirely at\\nmy mothers disposal without any restriction whatever\\nit has given me such an abhorrence of annuities that i am\\nsure i would not pin myself down to the payment of one for\\nall the world\\n\\nit is certainly an unpleasant thing replied mr dashwood\\nto have those kind of yearly drains on ones income\\nones fortune as your mother justly says is not ones own\\nto be tied down to the regular payment of such a sum\\non every rent day is by no means desirable it takes away\\nones independence\\n\\nundoubtedly and after all you have no thanks for it\\nthey think themselves secure you do no more than what\\nis expected and it raises no gratitude at all  if i were you\\nwhatever i did should be done at my own discretion entirely\\ni would not bind myself to allow them any thing yearly\\nit may be very inconvenient some years to spare a hundred\\nor even fifty pounds from our own expenses\\n\\ni believe you are right my love it will be better\\nthat there should by no annuity in the case whatever i\\nmay give them occasionally will be of far greater assistance\\nthan a yearly allowance because they would only enlarge\\ntheir style of living if they felt sure of a larger income\\nand would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end\\nof the year  it will certainly be much the best way\\na present of fifty pounds now and then will prevent\\ntheir ever being distressed for money and will i think\\nbe amply discharging my promise to my father\\n\\nto be sure it will  indeed to say the truth\\ni am convinced within myself that your father had no idea\\nof your giving them any money at all  the assistance\\nhe thought of i dare say was only such as might be\\nreasonably expected of you for instance such as looking\\nout for a comfortable small house for them helping them\\nto move their things and sending them presents of fish\\nand game and so forth whenever they are in season\\nill lay my life that he meant nothing farther indeed\\nit would be very strange and unreasonable if he did\\ndo but consider my dear mr dashwood how excessively\\ncomfortable your motherinlaw and her daughters may live\\non the interest of seven thousand pounds besides the\\nthousand pounds belonging to each of the girls which brings\\nthem in fifty pounds a year apiece and of course\\nthey will pay their mother for their board out of it\\naltogether they will have five hundred ayear amongst them\\nand what on earth can four women want for more than\\nthatthey will live so cheap their housekeeping will\\nbe nothing at all  they will have no carriage no horses\\nand hardly any servants they will keep no company\\nand can have no expenses of any kind  only conceive\\nhow comfortable they will be  five hundred a year i am\\nsure i cannot imagine how they will spend half of it\\nand as to your giving them more it is quite absurd to think\\nof it  they will be much more able to give you something\\n\\nupon my word said mr dashwood i believe you\\nare perfectly right  my father certainly could mean\\nnothing more by his request to me than what you say\\ni clearly understand it now and i will strictly fulfil\\nmy engagement by such acts of assistance and kindness\\nto them as you have described  when my mother removes\\ninto another house my services shall be readily given\\nto accommodate her as far as i can  some little present\\nof furniture too may be acceptable then\\n\\ncertainly returned mrs john dashwood  but however\\none thing must be considered  when your father and mother\\nmoved to norland though the furniture of stanhill\\nwas sold all the china plate and linen was saved\\nand is now left to your mother  her house will therefore\\nbe almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it\\n\\nthat is a material consideration undoubtedly\\na valuable legacy indeed and yet some of the plate would\\nhave been a very pleasant addition to our own stock here\\n\\nyes and the set of breakfast china is twice\\nas handsome as what belongs to this house  a great\\ndeal too handsome in my opinion for any place they\\ncan ever afford to live in  but however so it is\\nyour father thought only of them  and i must say this\\nthat you owe no particular gratitude to him nor attention\\nto his wishes for we very well know that if he could\\nhe would have left almost everything in the world to them\\n\\nthis argument was irresistible  it gave to his\\nintentions whatever of decision was wanting before and he\\nfinally resolved that it would be absolutely unnecessary\\nif not highly indecorous to do more for the widow\\nand children of his father than such kind of neighbourly\\nacts as his own wife pointed out\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 3\\n\\n\\nmrs dashwood remained at norland several months\\nnot from any disinclination to move when the sight of every\\nwell known spot ceased to raise the violent emotion which it\\nproduced for a while for when her spirits began to revive\\nand her mind became capable of some other exertion than that\\nof heightening its affliction by melancholy remembrances\\nshe was impatient to be gone and indefatigable in her inquiries\\nfor a suitable dwelling in the neighbourhood of norland\\nfor to remove far from that beloved spot was impossible\\nbut she could hear of no situation that at once answered\\nher notions of comfort and ease and suited the prudence\\nof her eldest daughter whose steadier judgment rejected\\nseveral houses as too large for their income which her\\nmother would have approved\\n\\nmrs dashwood had been informed by her husband of the\\nsolemn promise on the part of his son in their favour\\nwhich gave comfort to his last earthly reflections\\nshe doubted the sincerity of this assurance no more than he\\nhad doubted it himself and she thought of it for her daughters\\nsake with satisfaction though as for herself she was\\npersuaded that a much smaller provision than 7000l would\\nsupport her in affluence  for their brothers sake too\\nfor the sake of his own heart she rejoiced and she\\nreproached herself for being unjust to his merit before\\nin believing him incapable of generosity  his attentive\\nbehaviour to herself and his sisters convinced her that\\ntheir welfare was dear to him and for a long time\\nshe firmly relied on the liberality of his intentions\\n\\nthe contempt which she had very early in their acquaintance\\nfelt for her daughterinlaw was very much increased\\nby the farther knowledge of her character which half\\na years residence in her family afforded and perhaps\\nin spite of every consideration of politeness or maternal\\naffection on the side of the former the two ladies might\\nhave found it impossible to have lived together so long\\nhad not a particular circumstance occurred to give\\nstill greater eligibility according to the opinions\\nof mrs dashwood to her daughters continuance at norland\\n\\nthis circumstance was a growing attachment between\\nher eldest girl and the brother of mrs john dashwood\\na gentlemanlike and pleasing young man who was introduced\\nto their acquaintance soon after his sisters establishment\\nat norland and who had since spent the greatest part\\nof his time there\\n\\nsome mothers might have encouraged the intimacy from\\nmotives of interest for edward ferrars was the eldest son\\nof a man who had died very rich and some might have repressed\\nit from motives of prudence for except a trifling sum\\nthe whole of his fortune depended on the will of his mother\\nbut mrs dashwood was alike uninfluenced by either consideration\\nit was enough for her that he appeared to be amiable\\nthat he loved her daughter and that elinor returned\\nthe partiality  it was contrary to every doctrine of\\nhers that difference of fortune should keep any couple\\nasunder who were attracted by resemblance of disposition\\nand that elinors merit should not be acknowledged\\nby every one who knew her was to her comprehension impossible\\n\\nedward ferrars was not recommended to their good\\nopinion by any peculiar graces of person or address\\nhe was not handsome and his manners required intimacy\\nto make them pleasing  he was too diffident to do justice\\nto himself but when his natural shyness was overcome\\nhis behaviour gave every indication of an open\\naffectionate heart  his understanding was good\\nand his education had given it solid improvement\\nbut he was neither fitted by abilities nor disposition\\nto answer the wishes of his mother and sister who longed\\nto see him distinguishedasthey hardly knew what\\nthey wanted him to make a fine figure in the world in some\\nmanner or other  his mother wished to interest him in\\npolitical concerns to get him into parliament or to see\\nhim connected with some of the great men of the day\\nmrs john dashwood wished it likewise but in the mean while\\ntill one of these superior blessings could be attained it would\\nhave quieted her ambition to see him driving a barouche\\nbut edward had no turn for great men or barouches\\nall his wishes centered in domestic comfort and the quiet\\nof private life  fortunately he had a younger brother\\nwho was more promising\\n\\nedward had been staying several weeks in the house\\nbefore he engaged much of mrs dashwoods attention\\nfor she was at that time in such affliction as rendered\\nher careless of surrounding objects  she saw only that he\\nwas quiet and unobtrusive and she liked him for it\\nhe did not disturb the wretchedness of her mind by\\nilltimed conversation  she was first called to observe\\nand approve him farther by a reflection which elinor\\nchanced one day to make on the difference between him\\nand his sister  it was a contrast which recommended him\\nmost forcibly to her mother\\n\\nit is enough said she to say that he is unlike\\nfanny is enough  it implies everything amiable\\ni love him already\\n\\ni think you will like him said elinor when you\\nknow more of him\\n\\nlike him replied her mother with a smile\\ni feel no sentiment of approbation inferior to love\\n\\nyou may esteem him\\n\\ni have never yet known what it was to separate\\nesteem and love\\n\\nmrs dashwood now took pains to get acquainted with him\\nher manners were attaching and soon banished his reserve\\nshe speedily comprehended all his merits the persuasion\\nof his regard for elinor perhaps assisted her penetration\\nbut she really felt assured of his worth and even that\\nquietness of manner which militated against all her\\nestablished ideas of what a young mans address ought to be\\nwas no longer uninteresting when she knew his heart to be\\nwarm and his temper affectionate\\n\\nno sooner did she perceive any symptom of love\\nin his behaviour to elinor than she considered their\\nserious attachment as certain and looked forward\\nto their marriage as rapidly approaching\\n\\nin a few months my dear marianne said she\\nelinor will in all probability be settled for life\\nwe shall miss her but she will be happy\\n\\noh mamma how shall we do without her\\n\\nmy love it will be scarcely a

but yethe is not the kind of young\\nmanthere is something wantinghis figure is not striking\\nit has none of that grace which i should expect\\nin the man who could seriously attach my sister\\nhis eyes want all that spirit that fire which at once\\nannounce virtue and intelligence  and besides all this\\ni am afraid mamma he has no real taste  music seems\\nscarcely to attract him and though he admires elinors\\ndrawings very much it is not the admiration of a person\\nwho can understand their worth  it is evident in spite of\\nhis frequent attention to her while she draws that in fact\\nhe knows nothing of the matter  he admires as a lover\\nnot as a connoisseur  to satisfy me those characters\\nmust be united  i could not be happy with a man whose\\ntaste did not in every point coincide with my own\\nhe must enter into all my feelings the same books\\nthe same music must charm us both  oh mama how spiritless\\nhow tame was edwards manner in reading to us last night\\ni felt for my sister most severely  yet she bore it\\nwith so much composure she seemed scarcely to notice it\\ni could hardly keep my seat  to hear those beautiful lines\\nwhich have frequently almost driven me wild pronounced\\nwith such impenetrable calmness such dreadful indifference\\n\\nhe would certainly have done more justice to\\nsimple and elegant prose  i thought so at the time\\nbut you would give him cowper\\n\\nnay mamma if he is not to be animated by cowper\\nbut we must allow for difference of taste  elinor has\\nnot my feelings and therefore she may overlook it and\\nbe happy with him  but it would have broke my heart\\nhad i loved him to hear him read with so little sensibility\\nmama the more i know of the world the more am i convinced\\nthat i shall never see a man whom i can really love\\ni require so much  he must have all edwards virtues\\nand his person and manners must ornament his goodness\\nwith every possible charm\\n\\nremember my love that you are not

hers\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 4\\n\\n\\nwhat a pity it is elinor said marianne\\nthat edward should have no taste for drawing\\n\\nno taste for drawing replied elinor why should\\nyou think so he does not draw himself indeed but he has\\ngreat pleasure in seeing the performances of other people\\nand i assure you he is by no means deficient in natural taste\\nthough he has not had opportunities of improving it\\nhad he ever been in the way of learning i think he would\\nhave drawn very well  he distrusts his own judgment\\nin such matters so much that he is always unwilling\\nto give his opinion on any picture but he has an innate\\npropriety and simplicity of taste which in general\\ndirect him perfectly right\\n\\nmarianne was afraid of offending and said no more\\non the subject but the kind of approbation which elinor\\ndescribed as excited in him by the drawings of other\\npeople was very far from that rapturous delight which\\nin her opinion could alone be called taste  yet though\\nsmiling within herself at the mistake she honoured\\nher sister for that blind partiality to edward which produced it\\n\\ni hope marianne continued elinor you do not\\nconsider him as deficient in general taste  indeed i think\\ni may say that you cannot for your behaviour to him\\nis perfectly cordial and if that were your opinion\\ni am sure you could never be civil to him\\n\\nmarianne hardly knew what to say  she would\\nnot wound the feelings of her sister on any account\\nand yet to say what she did not believe was impossible\\nat length she replied\\n\\ndo not be offended elinor if my praise of him\\nis not in every thing equal to your sense of his merits\\ni have not had so many opportunities of estimating the minuter\\npropensities of his mind his inclinations and tastes\\nas you have but i have the highest opinion in the world\\nof his goodness and sense  i think him every thing that is\\nworthy and amiable\\n\\ni am sure replied elinor with a smile\\nthat his dearest friends could not be dissatisfied\\nwith such commendation as that  i do not perceive\\nhow you could express yourself more warmly\\n\\nmarianne was rejoiced to find her sister so easily pleased\\n\\nof his sense and his goodness continued elinor\\nno one can i think be in doubt who has seen him\\noften enough to engage him in unreserved conversation\\nthe excellence of his understanding and his principles\\ncan be concealed only by that shyness which too often\\nkeeps him silent  you know enough of him to do justice\\nto his solid worth  but of his minuter propensities\\nas you call them you have from peculiar circumstances\\nbeen kept more ignorant than myself  he and i have\\nbeen at times thrown a good deal together while you\\nhave been wholly engrossed on the most affectionate\\nprinciple by my mother  i have seen a great deal of him\\nhave studied his sentiments and heard his opinion on\\nsubjects of literature and taste and upon the whole\\ni venture to pronounce that his mind is wellinformed\\nenjoyment of books exceedingly great his imagination lively\\nhis observation just and correct and his taste delicate\\nand pure  his abilities in every respect improve\\nas much upon acquaintance as his manners and person\\nat first sight his address is certainly not striking\\nand his person can hardly be called handsome till the\\nexpression of his eyes which are uncommonly good\\nand the general sweetness of his countenance is perceived\\nat present i know him so well that i think him\\nreally handsome or at least almost so  what say you\\nmarianne\\n\\ni shall very soon think him handsome elinor if i\\ndo not now  when you tell me to love him as a brother\\ni shall no more see imperfection in his face than i now do\\nin his heart\\n\\nelinor started at this declaration and was sorry for\\nthe warmth she had been betrayed into in speaking of him\\nshe felt that edward stood very high in her opinion\\nshe believed the regard to be mutual but she required\\ngreater certainty of it to make mariannes conviction\\nof their attachment agreeable to her  she knew that\\nwhat marianne and her mother conjectured one moment\\nthey believed the nextthat with them to wish was to hope\\nand to hope was to expect  she tried to explain the real\\nstate of the case to her sister\\n\\ni do not attempt to deny said she that i think\\nvery highly of himthat i greatly esteem that i like him\\n\\nmarianne here burst forth with indignation\\n\\nesteem him like him coldhearted elinor oh\\nworse than coldhearted ashamed of being otherwise\\nuse those words again and i will leave the room this moment\\n\\nelinor could not help laughing  excuse me\\nsaid she and be assured that i meant no offence to you\\nby speaking in so quiet a way of my own feelings\\nbelieve them to be stronger than i have declared\\nbelieve them in short to be such as his merit and the\\nsuspicionthe hope of his affection for me may warrant\\nwithout imprudence or folly  but farther than this you must\\nnot believe  i am by no means assured of his regard for me\\nthere are moments when the extent of it seems doubtful\\nand till his sentiments are fully known you cannot wonder\\nat my wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own partiality\\nby believing or calling it more than it is  in my heart\\ni feel littlescarcely any doubt of his preference\\nbut there are other points to be considered besides\\nhis inclination  he is very far from being independent\\nwhat his mother really is we cannot know but from fannys\\noccasional mention of her conduct and opinions we have\\nnever been disposed to think her amiable and i am very\\nmuch mistaken if edward is not himself aware that there\\nwould be many difficulties in his way if he were to wish\\nto marry a woman who had not either a great fortune or\\nhigh rank\\n\\nmarianne was astonished to find how much the imagination\\nof her mother and herself had outstripped the truth\\n\\nand you really are not engaged to him said she\\nyet it certainly soon will happen  but two advantages\\nwill proceed from this delay  i shall not lose you so soon\\nand edward will have greater opportunity of improving\\nthat natural taste for your favourite pursuit which must\\nbe so indispensably necessary to your future felicity\\noh if he should be so

subject\\nshe was far from depending on that result of his preference\\nof her which her mother and sister still considered\\nas certain  nay the longer they were together the more\\ndoubtful seemed the nature of his regard and sometimes\\nfor a few painful minutes she believed it to be no more\\nthan friendship\\n\\nbut whatever might really be its limits it was enough\\nwhen perceived by his sister to make her uneasy\\nand at the same time which was still more common\\nto make her uncivil  she took the first opportunity of\\naffronting her motherinlaw on the occasion talking to\\nher so expressively of her brothers great expectations\\nof mrs ferrarss resolution that both her sons should\\nmarry well and of the danger attending any young woman\\nwho attempted to draw him in that mrs

the post which contained a proposal\\nparticularly well timed  it was the offer of a small house\\non very easy terms belonging to a relation of her own\\na gentleman of consequence and property in devonshire\\nthe letter was from this gentleman himself and written\\nin the true spirit of friendly accommodation\\nhe understood that she was in need of a dwelling\\nand though the house he now offered her was merely a cottage\\nhe assured her that everything should be done to it which\\nshe might think necessary if the situation pleased her\\nhe earnestly pressed her after giving the particulars\\nof the house and garden to come with her daughters to\\nbarton park the place of his own residence from whence\\nshe might judge herself whether barton cottage for the\\nhouses were in the same parish could by any alteration\\nbe made comfortable to her  he seemed really anxious to\\naccommodate them and the whole of his letter was written\\nin so friendly a style as could not fail of giving pleasure\\nto his cousin more especially at a moment when she was\\nsuffering under the cold and unfeeling behaviour of her\\nnearer connections  she needed no time for deliberation\\nor inquiry  her resolution was formed as she read\\nthe situation of barton in a county so far distant from\\nsussex as devonshire which but a few hours before\\nwould have been a sufficient objection to outweigh every\\npossible advantage belonging to the place was now its\\nfirst recommendation  to quit the neighbourhood of norland\\nwas no longer an evil it was an object of desire\\nit was a blessing in comparison of the misery of continuing\\nher daughterinlaws guest and to remove for ever\\nfrom that beloved place would be less painful than to\\ninhabit or visit it while such a woman was its mistress\\nshe instantly wrote sir john middleton her acknowledgment\\nof his kindness and her acceptance of his proposal\\nand then hastened to shew both letters to her daughters\\nthat she might be secure of their approbation before her\\nanswer were sent\\n\\nelinor had always thought it would be more prudent\\nfor them to settle at some distance from norland\\nthan immediately amongst their present acquaintance\\non that head therefore it was not for her to oppose\\nher mothers intention of removing into devonshire\\nthe house too as described by sir john was on so\\nsimple a scale and the rent so uncommonly moderate\\nas to leave her no right of objection on either point\\nand therefore though it was not a plan which brought\\nany charm to her fancy though it was a removal from\\nthe vicinity of norland beyond her wishes she made\\nno attempt to dissuade her mother from sending a letter\\nof acquiescence\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 5\\n\\n\\nno sooner was her answer dispatched than mrs dashwood\\nindulged herself in the pleasure of announcing to her\\nsoninlaw and his wife that she was provided with a house\\nand should incommode them no longer than till every thing

principally tended\\nto separate edward and elinor was as far from being her\\nobject as ever and she wished to show mrs john dashwood\\nby this pointed invitation to her brother how totally she\\ndisregarded her disapprobation of the match\\n\\nmr john dashwood told his mother again and again\\nhow exceedingly sorry he was that she had taken a house at\\nsuch a distance from norland as to prevent his being of any\\nservice to her in removing her furniture  he really felt\\nconscientiously vexed on the occasion for the very exertion\\nto which he had limited the performance of his

pianoforte of mariannes  mrs john\\ndashwood saw the packages depart with a sigh she could\\nnot help feeling it hard that as mrs dashwoods income\\nwould be so trifling in comparison with their own\\nshe should have any handsome article of furniture\\n\\nmrs dashwood took the house for a twelvemonth it was\\nready furnished and she might have immediate possession\\nno difficulty arose on either side in the agreement and she\\nwaited only for the disposal of her effects at norland\\nand to determine her future household before she set\\noff for the west and this as she was exceedingly rapid\\nin the performance of everything that interested her\\nwas soon donethe horses which were left her by her husband\\nhad been sold soon after his death and an opportunity\\nnow offering of disposing of her carriage she agreed\\nto sell that likewise at the earnest advice of her\\neldest daughter  for the comfort of her children had she\\nconsulted only her own wishes she would have kept

formed their establishment\\nat norland\\n\\nthe man and one of the maids were sent off immediately\\ninto devonshire to prepare the house for their mistresss\\narrival for as lady middleton was entirely unknown\\nto mrs dashwood she preferred going directly to the\\ncottage to being a visitor at barton park and she relied\\nso undoubtingly on sir johns description of the house\\nas to feel no curiosity to examine it herself till she\\nentered it as her own  her eagerness to be gone from norland\\nwas preserved from diminution by the evident satisfaction\\nof her daughterinlaw in the prospect of her removal\\na satisfaction which was but feebly attempted to be concealed\\nunder a cold invitation to her to defer her departure\\nnow was the time when her soninlaws promise to his\\nfather might with particular propriety be fulfilled\\nsince he had neglected to do it on first coming to\\nthe estate their quitting his house might be looked\\non as the most suitable period for its accomplishment\\nbut mrs dashwood began shortly to give over every\\nhope of the kind and to be convinced from the general\\ndrift of his discourse that his assistance extended no\\nfarther than their maintenance for six months at norland\\nhe so frequently talked of the increasing expenses\\nof housekeeping and of the perpetual demands upon his purse\\nwhich a man of any consequence in the world was beyond\\ncalculation exposed to that he seemed rather to stand\\nin need of more money himself than to have any design of\\ngiving money away\\n\\nin a very few weeks from the day which

 after winding along it for more than a mile\\nthey reached their own house  a small green court was\\nthe whole of its demesne in front and a neat wicket gate\\nadmitted them into it\\n\\nas a house barton cottage though small was comfortable\\nand compact but as a cottage it was defective for the\\nbuilding was regular the roof was tiled the window\\nshutters were not painted green nor were the walls covered\\nwith honeysuckles  a narrow passage led directly through\\nthe house into the garden behind  on each side of the\\nentrance was a sitting room about sixteen feet square\\nand beyond them were the offices and the stairs\\nfour bedrooms and two garrets formed the rest of the house\\nit had not been built many years and was in good repair\\nin comparison of norland it was poor and small indeedbut\\nthe tears which recollection called forth as they entered\\nthe house were soon dried away  they were cheered\\nby the joy of the servants on their arrival and each\\nfor the sake of the others resolved to appear happy\\nit was very early in september the season was fine\\nand from first seeing the place under the advantage\\nof good weather they received an impression in its\\nfavour which was of material service in recommending\\nit to their lasting approbation\\n\\nthe situation of the house was good  high hills rose\\nimmediately behind and at no great distance on each side\\nsome of which were open downs the others cultivated and woody\\nthe village of barton was chiefly on one of these hills\\nand formed a pleasant view from the cottage windows\\nthe prospect in front was more extensive it commanded the\\nwhole of the valley and reached into the country beyond\\nthe hills which surrounded the cottage terminated\\nthe valley in that direction under another name\\nand in another course it branched out again between two\\nof the steepest of them\\n\\nwith the size and furniture of the house mrs dashwood\\nwas upon the whole well satisfied for though her former\\nstyle of life rendered many additions to the latter\\nindispensable yet to add and improve was a delight to her\\nand she had at this time ready money enough to supply all\\nthat was wanted of greater elegance to the apartments\\nas for the house itself to be sure said she it is\\ntoo small for our family but we will make ourselves\\ntolerably comfortable for the present as it is too late\\nin the year for improvements  perhaps in the spring\\nif i have plenty of money as i dare say i shall we may\\nthink about building  these parlors are both too small\\nfor such parties of our friends as i hope to see often\\ncollected here and i have some thoughts of throwing the\\npassage into one of them with perhaps a part of the other\\nand so leave the remainder of that other for an entrance\\nthis with a new drawing room which may be easily added\\nand a bedchamber and garret above will make it a very snug\\nlittle cottage  i could wish the stairs were handsome\\nbut one must not expect every thing though i suppose it\\nwould be no difficult matter to widen them  i shall see\\nhow much i am beforehand with the world in the spring\\nand we will plan our improvements accordingly\\n\\nin the mean time till all these alterations could\\nbe made from the savings of an income of five hundred\\nayear by a woman who never saved in her life they were\\nwise enough to be contented with the house as it was\\nand each of them was busy in arranging their particular\\nconcerns and endeavoring by placing around them books\\nand other possessions to form themselves a

interrupted\\nsoon after breakfast the next day by the entrance of\\ntheir landlord who called to welcome them to barton\\nand to offer them every accommodation from his own house\\nand garden in which theirs might at present be deficient\\nsir john middleton was a good looking man about forty\\nhe had formerly visited at stanhill but it was too long\\nfor his young cousins to remember him  his countenance\\nwas thoroughly goodhumoured and his manners were\\nas friendly as the style of his letter  their arrival\\nseemed to afford him real satisfaction and their comfort\\nto be an object of real solicitude to him  he said much\\nof his earnest desire of their living in the most sociable\\nterms with his family and pressed them so cordially\\nto dine at barton park every day till they were better\\nsettled at home that though his entreaties were carried\\nto a point of perseverance beyond civility they could\\nnot give offence  his kindness was not confined to words\\nfor within an hour after he left them a large basket\\nfull of garden stuff and fruit arrived from the park\\nwhich was followed before the end of the day by a present\\nof game  he insisted moreover on conveying all their\\nletters to and from the post for them and would not be\\ndenied the satisfaction of sending them his newspaper\\nevery day\\n\\nlady middleton had sent a very civil message by him\\ndenoting her intention of waiting on mrs dashwood as soon as\\nshe could be assured that her visit would be no inconvenience\\nand as this message was answered by an invitation\\nequally polite her ladyship was introduced to them the next day\\n\\nthey were of course very anxious to see a person on\\nwhom so much of their comfort at barton must depend and the\\nelegance of her appearance was favourable to their wishes\\nlady middleton was not more than six or seven and twenty\\nher face was handsome her figure tall and striking\\nand her address graceful  her manners had all the elegance\\nwhich her husbands wanted  but they would have been\\nimproved by some share of his frankness and warmth\\nand her visit was long enough to detract something from\\ntheir first admiration by shewing that though perfectly\\nwellbred she was reserved cold and had nothing to say\\nfor herself beyond the most commonplace inquiry or remark\\n\\nconversation however was not wanted for sir john\\nwas very chatty and lady middleton had taken the wise\\nprecaution of bringing with her their eldest child a fine\\nlittle boy about six years old by which means there was\\none subject always to be recurred to by the ladies in case\\nof extremity for they had to enquire his name and age\\nadmire his beauty and ask him questions which his mother\\nanswered for him while he hung about her and held\\ndown his head to the great surprise of her ladyship\\nwho wondered at his being so shy before company as he\\ncould make noise enough at home  on every formal visit\\na child ought to be of the party by way of provision\\nfor discourse  in the present case it took up ten minutes\\nto determine whether the boy were most like his father\\nor mother and in what particular he resembled either\\nfor of course every body differed and every body was\\nastonished at the opinion of the others\\n\\nan opportunity was soon to be given to the dashwoods\\nof debating on the rest of the children as sir john\\nwould not leave the house without securing their promise\\nof dining at the park the next day\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 7\\n\\n\\nbarton park was about half a mile from the cottage\\nthe ladies had passed near it in their way along the valley\\nbut it was screened from their view at home by the\\nprojection of a hill  the house was large and handsome\\nand the middletons lived in a style of equal hospitality\\nand elegance  the former was for sir johns gratification\\nthe latter for that of his lady  they were scarcely\\never without some friends staying with them in the house\\nand they kept more company of every kind than any other\\nfamily in the neighbourhood  it was necessary to the\\nhappiness of both for however dissimilar in temper\\nand outward behaviour they strongly resembled each other\\nin that total want of talent and taste which confined\\ntheir employments unconnected with such as society produced\\nwithin a very narrow compass  sir john was a sportsman\\nlady middleton a mother  he hunted and shot and she\\nhumoured her children and these were their only resources\\nlady middleton had the advantage of being able to spoil her\\nchildren all the year round while sir johns independent\\nemployments were in existence only half the time\\ncontinual engagements at home and abroad however\\nsupplied all the deficiencies of nature and education\\nsupported the good spirits of sir john and gave exercise\\nto the good breeding of his wife\\n\\nlady middleton piqued herself upon the elegance\\nof her table and of all her domestic arrangements\\nand from this kind of vanity was her greatest enjoyment\\nin any of their parties  but sir johns satisfaction\\nin society was much more real he delighted in collecting\\nabout him more young people than his house would hold\\nand the noisier they were the better was he pleased\\nhe was a blessing to all the juvenile part of the neighbourhood\\nfor in summer he was for ever forming parties to eat cold\\nham and chicken out of doors and in winter his private\\nballs were numerous enough for any young lady who was not\\nsuffering under the unsatiable appetite of fifteen\\n\\nthe arrival of a new family in the country was always\\na matter of joy to him and in every point of view he was\\ncharmed with the inhabitants he had now procured for his\\ncottage at barton  the miss dashwoods were young pretty\\nand unaffected  it was enough to secure his good opinion\\nfor to be unaffected was all that a pretty girl could\\nwant to make her mind as captivating as her person\\nthe friendliness of his disposition made him happy in\\naccommodating those whose situation might be considered\\nin comparison with the past as unfortunate  in showing\\nkindness to his cousins therefore he had the real satisfaction\\nof a good heart and in settling a family of females only\\nin his cottage he had all the satisfaction of a sportsman\\nfor a sportsman though he esteems only those of his sex who\\nare sportsmen likewise is not often desirous of encouraging\\ntheir taste by admitting them to a residence within his own\\nmanor\\n\\nmrs dashwood and her daughters were met at the door\\nof the house by sir john who welcomed them to barton\\npark with unaffected sincerity and as he attended them\\nto the drawing room repeated to the young ladies the concern\\nwhich the same subject had drawn from him the day before\\nat being unable to get any smart young men to meet them\\nthey would see he said only one gentleman there\\nbesides himself a particular friend who was staying at\\nthe park but who was neither very young nor very gay\\nhe hoped they would all excuse the smallness of the party\\nand could assure them it should never happen so again\\nhe had been to several families that morning in hopes\\nof procuring some addition to their number but it\\nwas moonlight and every body was full of engagements\\nluckily lady middletons mother had arrived at barton\\nwithin the last hour and as she was a very cheerful\\nagreeable woman he hoped the young ladies would not find\\nit so very dull as they might imagine  the young ladies\\nas well as their mother were perfectly satisfied with\\nhaving two entire strangers of the party and wished for\\nno more\\n\\nmrs jennings lady middletons mother was a\\ngoodhumoured merry fat elderly woman who talked a\\ngreat deal seemed very happy and rather vulgar  she was full\\nof jokes and laughter and before dinner was over had said\\nmany witty things on the subject of lovers and husbands\\nhoped they had not left their hearts behind them in sussex\\nand pretended to see them blush whether they did or not\\nmarianne was vexed at it for her sisters sake and turned\\nher eyes towards elinor to see how she bore these attacks\\nwith an earnestness which gave elinor far more pain than\\ncould arise from such commonplace raillery as mrs jenningss\\n\\ncolonel brandon the friend of sir john seemed no\\nmore adapted by resemblance of manner to be his friend\\nthan lady middleton was to be his wife or mrs jennings\\nto be lady middletons mother  he was silent and grave\\nhis appearance however was not unpleasing in spite\\nof his being in the opinion of marianne and margaret\\nan absolute old bachelor for he was on the wrong side\\nof five and thirty but though his face was not handsome\\nhis countenance was sensible and his address was\\nparticularly gentlemanlike\\n\\nthere was nothing in any of the party which could\\nrecommend them as companions to the dashwoods but the cold\\ninsipidity of lady middleton was so particularly repulsive\\nthat in comparison of it the gravity of colonel brandon\\nand even the boisterous mirth of sir john and his\\nmotherinlaw was interesting  lady middleton seemed\\nto be roused to enjoyment only by the entrance of her\\nfour noisy children after dinner who pulled her about\\ntore her clothes and put an end to every kind of discourse\\nexcept what related to themselves\\n\\nin the evening as marianne was discovered to be musical\\nshe was invited to play  the instrument was unlocked\\nevery body prepared to be charmed and marianne\\nwho sang very well at their request went through the\\nchief of the songs which lady middleton had brought into\\nthe family on her marriage and which perhaps had lain\\never since in the same position on the pianoforte\\nfor her ladyship had celebrated that event by giving\\nup music although by her mothers account she had\\nplayed extremely well and by her own was very fond of it\\n\\nmariannes performance was highly applauded\\nsir john was loud in his admiration at the end of every song\\nand as loud in his conversation with the others while every\\nsong lasted  lady middleton frequently called him to order\\nwondered how any ones attention could be diverted from music\\nfor a moment and asked marianne to sing a particular song\\nwhich marianne had just finished  colonel brandon alone\\nof all the party heard her without being in raptures\\nhe paid her only the compliment of attention and she felt\\na respect for him on the occasion which the others had\\nreasonably forfeited by their shameless want of taste\\nhis pleasure in music though it amounted not to that\\necstatic delight which alone could sympathize with her own\\nwas estimable when contrasted against the horrible\\ninsensibility of the others and she was reasonable enough\\nto allow that a man of five and thirty might well have\\noutlived all acuteness of feeling and every exquisite\\npower of enjoyment  she was perfectly disposed to make\\nevery allowance for the colonels advanced state of life\\nwhich humanity required\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 8\\n\\n\\nmrs jennings was a widow with an ample jointure\\nshe had only two daughters both of whom she had lived\\nto see respectably married and she had now therefore\\nnothing to do but to marry all the rest of the world\\nin the promotion of this object she was zealously active\\nas far as her ability reached and missed no opportunity\\nof projecting weddings among all the young people\\nof her acquaintance  she was remarkably quick in the\\ndiscovery of attachments and had enjoyed the advantage\\nof raising the blushes and the vanity of many a young\\nlady by insinuations of her power over such a young man\\nand this kind of discernment enabled her soon after her\\narrival at barton decisively to pronounce that colonel\\nbrandon was very much in love with marianne dashwood\\nshe rather suspected it to be so on the very first\\nevening of their being together from his listening\\nso attentively while she sang to them and when the visit\\nwas returned by the middletons dining at the cottage\\nthe fact was ascertained by his listening to her again\\nit must be so  she was perfectly convinced of it\\nit would be an excellent match for he was rich and she\\nwas handsome  mrs jennings had been anxious to see\\ncolonel brandon well married ever since her connection\\nwith sir john first brought him to her knowledge\\nand she was always anxious to get a good husband for every\\npretty girl\\n\\nthe immediate advantage to herself was by no means\\ninconsiderable for it supplied her with endless jokes\\nagainst them both  at the park she laughed at the colonel\\nand in the cottage at marianne  to the former her\\nraillery was probably as far as it regarded only himself\\nperfectly indifferent but to the latter it was at\\nfirst incomprehensible and when its object was understood\\nshe hardly knew whether most to laugh at its absurdity\\nor censure its impertinence for she considered it as an\\nunfeeling reflection on the colonels advanced years\\nand on his forlorn condition as an old bachelor\\n\\nmrs dashwood who could not think a man five years\\nyounger than herself so exceedingly ancient as he appeared\\nto the youthful fancy of her daughter ventured to clear\\nmrs jennings from the probability of wishing to throw\\nridicule on his age\\n\\nbut at least mamma you cannot deny the absurdity\\nof the accusation though you may not think it intentionally\\nillnatured  colonel brandon is certainly younger than\\nmrs jennings but he is old enough to be my father\\nand if he were ever animated enough to be in love\\nmust have long outlived every sensation of the kind\\nit is too ridiculous  when is a man to be safe from such wit\\nif age and infirmity will not protect him\\n\\ninfirmity said elinor do you call colonel brandon\\ninfirm  i can easily suppose that his age may appear much\\ngreater to you than to my mother but you can hardly\\ndeceive yourself as to his having the use of his limbs\\n\\ndid not you hear him complain of the rheumatism\\nand is not that the commonest infirmity of declining life\\n\\nmy dearest child said her mother laughing\\nat this rate you must be in continual terror of my decay\\nand it must seem to you a miracle that my life has been\\nextended to the advanced age of forty\\n\\nmamma you are not doing me justice  i know very well\\nthat colonel brandon is not old enough to make his friends\\nyet apprehensive of losing him in the course of nature\\nhe may live twenty years longer  but thirtyfive has\\nnothing to do with matrimony\\n\\nperhaps said elinor thirtyfive and seventeen had\\nbetter not have any thing to do with matrimony together\\nbut if there should by any chance happen to be a woman\\nwho is single at seven and twenty i should not think\\ncolonel brandons being thirtyfive any objection to his\\nmarrying her\\n\\na woman of seven and twenty said marianne\\nafter pausing a moment can never hope to feel or inspire\\naffection again and if her home be uncomfortable\\nor her fortune small i can suppose that she might\\nbring herself to submit to the offices of a nurse\\nfor the sake of the provision and security of a wife\\nin his marrying such a woman therefore there would be\\nnothing unsuitable  it would be a compact of convenience\\nand the world would be satisfied  in my eyes it would\\nbe no marriage at all but that would be nothing\\nto me it would seem only a commercial exchange in which\\neach wished to be benefited at the expense of the other\\n\\nit would be impossible i know replied elinor\\nto convince you that a woman of seven and twenty could\\nfeel for a man of thirtyfive anything near enough\\nto love to make him a desirable companion to her\\nbut i must object to your dooming colonel brandon and\\nhis wife to the constant confinement of a sick chamber\\nmerely because he chanced to complain yesterday a\\nvery cold damp day of a slight rheumatic feel in one\\nof his shoulders\\n\\nbut he talked of flannel waistcoats said marianne\\nand with me a flannel waistcoat is invariably connected\\nwith aches cramps rheumatisms and every species of\\nailment that can afflict the old and the feeble\\n\\nhad he

you are mistaken for when i\\nwas talking to her yesterday of getting a new grate\\nfor the spare bedchamber she observed that there\\nwas no immediate hurry for it as it was not likely\\nthat the

glimpse of blue sky and when they\\ncaught in their faces the animating gales of a high\\nsouthwesterly wind they pitied the fears which had prevented\\ntheir mother and elinor from sharing such delightful sensations\\n\\nis there a felicity in the world said marianne\\nsuperior to thismargaret we will walk here at least\\ntwo hours\\n\\nmargaret agreed and they pursued their way against\\nthe wind resisting it with laughing delight for about\\ntwenty minutes longer when suddenly the clouds united over\\ntheir heads and a driving rain set full in their face\\nchagrined and surprised they were obliged though unwillingly\\nto turn back for no shelter was nearer than their own house\\none consolation however remained for them to which the\\nexigence of the moment gave more than usual propriety\\nit was that of running with all possible speed down the steep\\nside of the hill which led immediately to their garden gate\\n\\nthey set off  marianne had at first the advantage\\nbut a false step brought her suddenly to the ground\\nand margaret unable to stop herself to assist her\\nwas involuntarily hurried along and reached the bottom\\nin safety\\n\\na gentleman carrying a gun with two pointers\\nplaying round him was passing up the hill and within\\na few yards of marianne when her accident happened\\nhe put down his gun and ran to her assistance  she had\\nraised herself from the ground but her foot had been\\ntwisted in her fall and she was scarcely able to stand\\nthe gentleman offered his services and perceiving that her\\nmodesty declined what her situation rendered necessary\\ntook her up in his arms without farther delay and carried\\nher down the hill  then passing through the garden\\nthe gate of which had been left open by margaret he bore her\\ndirectly into the house whither margaret was just arrived\\nand quitted not his hold till he had seated her in a chair\\nin the parlour\\n\\nelinor and her mother rose up in amazement at\\ntheir entrance and while the eyes of both were fixed\\non him with an evident wonder and a secret admiration\\nwhich equally sprung from his appearance he apologized\\nfor his intrusion by relating its cause in a manner\\nso frank and so graceful that his person which was\\nuncommonly handsome received additional charms from his voice\\nand expression  had he been even old ugly and vulgar\\nthe gratitude and kindness of mrs dashwood would\\nhave been secured by any act of attention to her child\\nbut the influence of youth beauty and elegance\\ngave an interest to the action which came home to her feelings\\n\\nshe thanked him again and again and with a sweetness\\nof address which always attended her invited him to\\nbe seated  but this he declined as he was dirty and wet\\nmrs dashwood then begged to know to whom she was obliged\\nhis name he replied was willoughby and his present\\nhome was at allenham from whence he hoped she would\\nallow him the honour of calling tomorrow to enquire\\nafter miss dashwood  the honour was readily granted\\nand he then departed to make himself still more interesting\\nin the midst of a heavy rain\\n\\nhis manly beauty and more than common gracefulness\\nwere instantly the theme of general admiration\\nand the laugh which his gallantry raised against marianne\\nreceived particular spirit from his exterior attractions\\nmarianne herself had seen less of his person that the rest\\nfor the confusion which crimsoned over her face on his\\nlifting her up had robbed her of the power of regarding\\nhim after their entering the house  but she had seen\\nenough of him to join in all the admiration of the others\\nand with an energy which always adorned her praise\\nhis person and air were equal to what her fancy had ever\\ndrawn for the hero of a favourite story and in his carrying\\nher into the house with so little previous formality there\\nwas a rapidity of thought which particularly recommended\\nthe action to her  every circumstance belonging to him\\nwas interesting  his name was good his residence was in\\ntheir favourite village and she soon found out that of all\\nmanly dresses a shootingjacket was the most becoming\\nher imagination was busy her reflections were pleasant\\nand the pain of a sprained ankle was disregarded\\n\\nsir john called on them as soon as the next interval\\nof fair weather that morning allowed him to get out\\nof doors and mariannes accident being related to him\\nhe was eagerly asked whether he knew any gentleman\\nof the name of willoughby at allenham\\n\\nwilloughby cried sir john what is he\\nin the country that is good news however i will\\nride over tomorrow and ask him to dinner on thursday\\n\\nyou know him then said mrs dashwood\\n\\nknow him to be sure i do  why he is down here\\nevery year\\n\\nand what sort of a young man is he\\n\\nas good a kind of fellow as ever lived i assure you\\na very decent shot and there is not a bolder rider\\nin england\\n\\nand is that all you can say for him cried marianne\\nindignantly  but what are his manners on more intimate\\nacquaintance what his pursuits his talents and genius\\n\\nsir john was rather puzzled\\n\\nupon my soul said he i do not know much about him\\nas to all that  but he is a pleasant good humoured fellow\\nand has got the nicest little black bitch of a pointer\\ni ever saw  was she out with him today\\n\\nbut marianne could no more satisfy him as to the\\ncolour of mr willoughbys pointer than he could\\ndescribe to her the shades of his mind\\n\\nbut who is he said elinor  where does he come\\nfrom  has he a house at allenham\\n\\non this point sir john could give more certain intelligence\\nand he told them that mr willoughby had no property\\nof his own in the country that he resided there only\\nwhile he was visiting the old lady at allenham court\\nto whom he was related and whose possessions he was\\nto inherit adding yes yes he is very well worth\\ncatching i can tell you miss dashwood he has a pretty\\nlittle estate of his own in somersetshire besides\\nand if i were you i would not give him up to my\\nyounger sister in spite of all this tumbling down hills\\nmiss marianne must not expect to have all the men to herself\\nbrandon will be jealous if she does not take care\\n\\ni do not believe said mrs dashwood with a\\ngood humoured smile that mr willoughby will be incommoded\\nby the attempts of either of my daughters towards what\\nyou call catching him  it is not an employment to which\\nthey have been brought up  men are very safe with us\\nlet them be ever so rich  i am glad to find however\\nfrom what you say that he is a respectable young man\\nand one whose acquaintance will not be ineligible\\n\\nhe is as good a sort of fellow i believe\\nas ever lived repeated sir john  i remember\\nlast christmas at a little hop at the park he danced\\nfrom eight oclock till four without once sitting down\\n\\ndid he indeed cried marianne with sparkling eyes\\nand with elegance with spirit\\n\\nyes and he was up again at eight to ride to covert\\n\\nthat is what i like that is what a young man ought\\nto be  whatever be his pursuits his eagerness in them\\nshould know no moderation and leave him no sense of fatigue\\n\\naye aye i see how it will be said sir john i see\\nhow it will be  you will be setting your cap at him now\\nand never think of poor brandon\\n\\nthat is an expression sir john said marianne\\nwarmly which i particularly dislike  i abhor every\\ncommonplace phrase by which wit is intended and setting\\nones cap at a man or making a conquest are the most\\nodious of all  their tendency is gross and illiberal\\nand if their construction could ever be deemed clever\\ntime has long ago destroyed all its ingenuity\\n\\nsir john did not much understand this reproof\\nbut he laughed as heartily as if he did and then replied\\n\\nay you will make conquests enough i dare say\\none way or other  poor brandon he is quite smitten already\\nand he is very well worth setting your cap at i can\\ntell you in spite of all this tumbling about and spraining\\nof ankles\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 10\\n\\n\\nmariannes preserver as margaret with more elegance\\nthan precision styled willoughby called at the cottage\\nearly the next morning to make his personal enquiries\\nhe was received by mrs dashwood with more than politeness\\nwith a kindness which sir johns account of him and her own\\ngratitude prompted and every thing that passed during\\nthe visit tended to assure him of the sense elegance\\nmutual affection and domestic comfort of the family\\nto whom accident had now introduced him  of their\\npersonal charms he had not required a second interview\\nto be convinced\\n\\nmiss dashwood had a delicate complexion\\nregular features and a remarkably pretty figure\\nmarianne was still handsomer  her form though not so\\ncorrect as her sisters in having the advantage of height\\nwas more striking and her face was so lovely that when\\nin the common cant of praise she was called a beautiful girl\\ntruth was less violently outraged than usually happens\\nher skin was very brown but from its transparency\\nher complexion was uncommonly brilliant her features\\nwere all good her smile was sweet and attractive\\nand in her eyes which were very dark there was a life\\na spirit an eagerness which could hardily be seen\\nwithout delight  from willoughby their expression was at\\nfirst held back by the embarrassment which the remembrance\\nof his assistance created  but when this passed away\\nwhen her spirits became collected when she saw that to the\\nperfect goodbreeding of the gentleman he united frankness\\nand vivacity and above all when she heard him declare\\nthat of music and dancing he was passionately fond\\nshe gave him such a look of approbation as secured the\\nlargest share of his discourse to herself for the rest\\nof his stay\\n\\nit was only necessary to mention any favourite\\namusement to engage her to talk  she could not be\\nsilent when such points were introduced and she\\nhad neither shyness nor reserve in their discussion\\nthey speedily discovered that their enjoyment of dancing\\nand music was mutual and that it arose from a general\\nconformity of judgment in all that related to either\\nencouraged by this to a further examination of his opinions\\nshe proceeded to question him on the subject of books\\nher favourite authors were brought forward and dwelt\\nupon with so rapturous a delight that any young man of\\nfive and twenty must have been insensible indeed not to\\nbecome an immediate convert to the excellence of such works\\nhowever disregarded before  their taste was strikingly alike\\nthe same books the same passages were idolized by each\\nor if any difference appeared any objection arose\\nit lasted no longer than till the force of her arguments\\nand the brightness of her eyes could be displayed\\nhe acquiesced in all her decisions caught all her enthusiasm\\nand long before his visit concluded they conversed\\nwith the familiarity of a longestablished acquaintance\\n\\nwell marianne said elinor as soon as he had left them\\nfor one morning i think you have done pretty well\\nyou have already ascertained mr willoughbys opinion in\\nalmost every matter of importance  you know what he thinks\\nof cowper and scott you are certain of his estimating\\ntheir beauties as he ought and you have received every\\nassurance of his admiring pope no more than is proper\\nbut how is your acquaintance to be long supported under such\\nextraordinary despatch of every subject for discourse\\nyou will soon have exhausted each favourite topic\\nanother meeting will suffice to explain his sentiments\\non picturesque beauty and second marriages and then\\nyou can have nothing farther to ask\\n\\nelinor cried marianne is this fair is this\\njust are my ideas so scanty  but i see what you mean\\ni have been too much at my ease too happy too frank\\ni have erred against every commonplace notion of decorum\\ni have been open and sincere where i ought to have\\nbeen reserved spiritless dull and deceitfulhad\\ni talked only of the weather and the roads and had i\\nspoken only once in ten minutes this reproach would have\\nbeen spared\\n\\nmy love said her mother you must not be offended\\nwith elinorshe was only in jest  i should scold\\nher myself if she were capable of wishing to check\\nthe delight of your conversation with our new friend\\nmarianne was softened in a moment\\n\\nwilloughby on his side gave every proof of his\\npleasure in their acquaintance which an evident wish\\nof improving it could offer  he came to them every day\\nto enquire after marianne was at first his excuse but the\\nencouragement of his reception to which every day gave\\ngreater kindness made such an excuse unnecessary before it\\nhad ceased to be possible by mariannes perfect recovery\\nshe was confined for some days to the house but never had\\nany confinement been less irksome  willoughby was a young\\nman of good abilities quick imagination lively spirits\\nand open affectionate manners  he was exactly formed\\nto engage mariannes heart for with all this he joined\\nnot only a captivating person but a natural ardour\\nof mind which was now roused and increased by the example\\nof her own and which recommended him to her affection\\nbeyond every thing else\\n\\nhis society became gradually her most exquisite enjoyment\\nthey read they talked they sang together his musical\\ntalents were considerable and he read with all the\\nsensibility and spirit which edward had unfortunately wanted\\n\\nin mrs dashwoods estimation he was as faultless\\nas in mariannes and elinor saw nothing to censure in him\\nbut a propensity in which he strongly resembled and peculiarly\\ndelighted her sister of saying too much what he thought on\\nevery occasion without attention to persons or circumstances\\nin hastily forming and giving his opinion of other people\\nin sacrificing general politeness to the enjoyment\\nof undivided attention where his heart was engaged\\nand in slighting too easily the forms of worldly propriety\\nhe displayed a want of caution which elinor could not approve\\nin spite of all that he and marianne could say in its support\\n\\nmarianne began now to perceive that the desperation\\nwhich had seized her at sixteen and a half of ever\\nseeing a man who could satisfy her ideas of perfection\\nhad been rash and unjustifiable  willoughby was all\\nthat her fancy had delineated in that unhappy hour\\nand in every brighter period as capable of attaching her\\nand his behaviour declared his wishes to be in that respect\\nas earnest as his abilities were strong\\n\\nher mother too in whose mind not one speculative\\nthought of their marriage had been raised by his prospect\\nof riches was led before the end of a week to hope and\\nexpect it and secretly to congratulate herself on having\\ngained two such sonsinlaw as edward and willoughby\\n\\ncolonel brandons partiality for marianne which had\\nso early been discovered by his friends now first became\\nperceptible to elinor when it ceased to be noticed\\nby them  their attention and wit were drawn off to his\\nmore fortunate rival and the raillery which the other\\nhad incurred before any partiality arose was removed\\nwhen his feelings began really to call for the ridicule\\nso justly annexed to sensibility  elinor was obliged\\nthough unwillingly to believe that the sentiments which\\nmrs jennings had assigned him for her own satisfaction\\nwere now actually excited by her sister and that however\\na general resemblance of disposition between the parties\\nmight forward the affection of mr willoughby an equally\\nstriking opposition of character was no hindrance to the\\nregard of colonel brandon  she saw it with concern\\nfor what could a silent man of five and thirty hope\\nwhen opposed to a very lively one of five and twenty and as\\nshe could not even wish him successful she heartily wished\\nhim indifferent  she liked himin spite of his gravity\\nand reserve she beheld in him an object of interest\\nhis manners though serious were mild and his reserve\\nappeared rather the result of some oppression of spirits\\nthan of any natural gloominess of temper  sir john\\nhad dropped hints of past injuries and disappointments\\nwhich justified her belief of his being an unfortunate man\\nand she regarded him with respect and compassion\\n\\nperhaps she pitied and esteemed him the more\\nbecause he was slighted by willoughby and marianne\\nwho prejudiced against him for being neither lively\\nnor young seemed resolved to undervalue his merits\\n\\nbrandon is just the kind of man said willoughby\\none day when they were talking of him together\\nwhom every body speaks well of and nobody cares about\\nwhom all are delighted to see and nobody remembers\\nto talk to\\n\\nthat is exactly what i think of him cried marianne\\n\\ndo not boast of it however said elinor for it\\nis injustice in both of you  he is highly esteemed\\nby all the family at the park and i never see him myself\\nwithout taking pains to converse with him\\n\\nthat he is patronised by you replied willoughby\\nis certainly in his favour but as for the esteem\\nof the others it is a reproach in itself  who would\\nsubmit to the indignity of being approved by such a woman\\nas lady middleton and mrs jennings that could command\\nthe indifference of any body else\\n\\nbut perhaps the abuse of such people as yourself\\nand marianne will make amends for the regard of lady\\nmiddleton and her mother  if their praise is censure\\nyour censure may be praise for they are not more undiscerning\\nthan you are prejudiced and unjust\\n\\nin defence of your protege you can even be saucy\\n\\nmy protege as you call him is a sensible man\\nand sense will always have attractions for me\\nyes marianne even in a man between thirty and forty\\nhe has seen a great deal of the world has been abroad\\nhas read and has a thinking mind  i have found him\\ncapable of giving me much information on various subjects\\nand he has always answered my inquiries with readiness of\\ngoodbreeding and good nature\\n\\nthat is to say cried marianne contemptuously\\nhe has told you that in the east indies the climate is hot\\nand the mosquitoes are troublesome\\n\\nhe would have told me so i doubt not had i made\\nany such inquiries but they happened to be points\\non which i had been previously informed\\n\\nperhaps said willoughby his observations may\\nhave extended to the existence of nabobs gold mohrs\\nand palanquins\\n\\ni may venture to say that his observations\\nhave stretched much further than your candour\\nbut why should you dislike him\\n\\ni do not dislike him  i consider him on the contrary\\nas a very respectable man who has every bodys good word\\nand nobodys notice who has more money than he can spend\\nmore time than he knows how to employ and two new coats\\nevery year\\n\\nadd to which cried marianne that he has\\nneither genius taste nor spirit  that his understanding\\nhas no brilliancy his feelings no ardour and his voice\\nno expression\\n\\nyou decide on his imperfections so much in the mass\\nreplied elinor and so much on the strength of your\\nown imagination that the commendation i am able to give\\nof him is comparatively cold and insipid  i can only\\npronounce him to be a sensible man wellbred wellinformed\\nof gentle address and i believe possessing an amiable heart\\n\\nmiss dashwood cried willoughby you are now using\\nme unkindly  you are endeavouring to disarm me by reason\\nand to convince me against my will  but it will not do\\nyou shall find me as stubborn as you can be artful  i have\\nthree unanswerable reasons for disliking colonel brandon\\nhe threatened me with rain when i wanted it to be fine\\nhe has found fault with the hanging of my curricle\\nand i cannot persuade him to buy my brown mare  if it\\nwill be any satisfaction to you however to be told\\nthat i believe his character to be in other respects\\nirreproachable i am ready to confess it  and in return\\nfor an acknowledgment which must give me some pain\\nyou cannot deny me the privilege of disliking him as much\\nas ever\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 11\\n\\n\\nlittle had mrs dashwood or her daughters imagined\\nwhen they first came into devonshire that so many\\nengagements would arise to occupy their time as shortly\\npresented themselves or that they should have such frequent\\ninvitations and such constant visitors as to leave them little\\nleisure for serious employment  yet such was the case\\nwhen marianne was recovered the schemes of amusement at home\\nand abroad which sir john had been previously forming\\nwere put into execution  the private balls at the park\\nthen began and parties on the water were made and\\naccomplished as often as a showery october would allow\\nin every meeting of the kind willoughby was included\\nand the ease and familiarity which naturally attended\\nthese parties were exactly calculated to give increasing\\nintimacy to his acquaintance with the dashwoods to afford\\nhim opportunity of witnessing the excellencies of marianne\\nof marking his animated admiration of her and of receiving\\nin her behaviour to himself the most pointed assurance\\nof her affection\\n\\nelinor could not be surprised at their attachment\\nshe only wished that it were less openly shewn and once\\nor twice did venture to suggest the propriety of some\\nselfcommand to marianne  but marianne abhorred all\\nconcealment where no real disgrace could attend unreserve\\nand to aim at the restraint of sentiments which were not\\nin themselves illaudable appeared to her not merely\\nan unnecessary effort but a disgraceful subjection\\nof reason to commonplace and mistaken notions\\nwilloughby thought the same and their behaviour at\\nall times was an illustration of their opinions\\n\\nwhen he was present she had no eyes for any one else\\nevery thing he did was right  every thing he said was clever\\nif their evenings at the park were concluded with cards\\nhe cheated himself and all the rest of the party to get\\nher a good hand  if dancing formed the amusement\\nof the night they were partners for half the time\\nand when obliged to separate for a couple of dances\\nwere careful to stand together and scarcely spoke a word\\nto any body else  such conduct made them of course\\nmost exceedingly laughed at but ridicule could not shame\\nand seemed hardly to provoke them\\n\\nmrs dashwood entered into all their feelings with\\na warmth which left her no inclination for checking this\\nexcessive display of them  to her it was but the natural\\nconsequence of a strong affection in a young and ardent mind\\n\\nthis was the season of happiness to marianne\\nher heart was devoted to willoughby and the fond attachment\\nto norland which she brought with her from sussex\\nwas more likely to be softened than she had thought it\\npossible before by the charms which his society bestowed\\non her present home\\n\\nelinors happiness was not so great  her heart was not\\nso much at ease nor her satisfaction in their amusements\\nso pure  they afforded her no companion that could make\\namends for what she had left behind nor that could teach\\nher to think of norland with less regret than ever\\nneither lady middleton nor mrs jennings could supply\\nto her the conversation she missed although the latter\\nwas an everlasting talker and from the first had regarded\\nher with a kindness which ensured her a large share of\\nher discourse  she had already repeated her own history\\nto elinor three or four times and had elinors memory been\\nequal to her means of improvement she might have known\\nvery early in their acquaintance all the particulars of\\nmr jennings last illness and what he said to his wife\\na few minutes before he died  lady middleton was more\\nagreeable than her mother only in being more silent\\nelinor needed little observation to perceive that her\\nreserve was a mere calmness of manner with which sense\\nhad nothing to do  towards her husband and mother she\\nwas the same as to them and intimacy was therefore\\nneither to be looked for nor desired  she had nothing\\nto say one day that she had not said the day before\\nher insipidity was invariable for even her spirits were\\nalways the same and though she did not oppose the parties\\narranged by her husband provided every thing were conducted\\nin style and her two eldest children attended her\\nshe never appeared to receive more enjoyment from them\\nthan she might have experienced in sitting at home\\nand so little did her presence add to the pleasure\\nof the others by any share in their conversation\\nthat they were sometimes only reminded of her being\\namongst them by her solicitude about her troublesome boys\\n\\nin colonel brandon alone of all her new acquaintance\\ndid elinor find a person who could in any degree claim the\\nrespect of abilities excite the interest of friendship\\nor give pleasure as a companion  willoughby was out\\nof the question  her admiration and regard even her\\nsisterly regard was all his own but he was a lover\\nhis attentions were wholly mariannes and a far less\\nagreeable man might have been more generally pleasing\\ncolonel brandon unfortunately for himself had no such\\nencouragement to think only of marianne and in conversing\\nwith elinor he found the greatest consolation for the\\nindifference of her sister\\n\\nelinors compassion for him increased as she had reason\\nto suspect that the misery of disappointed love had already\\nbeen known to him  this suspicion was given by some words\\nwhich accidently dropped from him one evening at the park\\nwhen they were sitting down together by mutual consent\\nwhile the others were dancing  his eyes were fixed\\non marianne and after a silence of some minutes\\nhe said with a faint smile your sister i understand\\ndoes not approve of second attachments\\n\\nno replied elinor her opinions are all romantic\\n\\nor rather as i believe she considers them\\nimpossible to exist\\n\\ni believe she does  but how she contrives it\\nwithout reflecting on the character of her own father\\nwho had himself two wives i know not  a few years\\nhowever will settle her opinions on the reasonable basis\\nof common sense and observation and then they may be\\nmore easy to define and to justify than they now are\\nby any body but herself\\n\\nthis will probably be the case he replied\\nand yet there is something so amiable in the prejudices\\nof a young mind that one is sorry to see them give way\\nto the reception of more general opinions\\n\\ni cannot agree with you there said elinor\\nthere are inconveniences attending such feelings\\nas mariannes which all the charms of enthusiasm and\\nignorance of the world cannot atone for  her systems have\\nall the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at nought\\nand a better acquaintance with the world is what i look\\nforward to as her greatest possible advantage\\n\\nafter a short pause he resumed the conversation\\nby saying\\n\\ndoes your sister make no distinction in her objections\\nagainst a second attachment or is it equally criminal\\nin every body  are those who have been disappointed\\nin their first choice whether from the inconstancy\\nof its object or the perverseness of circumstances\\nto be equally indifferent during the rest of their lives\\n\\nupon my word i am not acquainted with the minutiae\\nof her principles  i only know that i never yet heard her\\nadmit any instance of a second attachments being pardonable\\n\\nthis said he cannot hold but a change\\na total change of sentimentsno no do not desire it\\nfor when the romantic refinements of a young mind\\nare obliged to give way how frequently are they\\nsucceeded by such opinions as are but too common and too\\ndangerous  i speak from experience  i once knew a lady\\nwho in temper and mind greatly resembled your sister\\nwho thought and judged like her but who from an inforced\\nchangefrom a series of unfortunate circumstances\\nhere he stopt suddenly appeared to think that he had said\\ntoo much and by his countenance gave rise to conjectures\\nwhich might not otherwise have entered elinors head\\nthe lady would probably have passed without suspicion\\nhad he not convinced miss dashwood that what concerned\\nher ought not to escape his lips  as it was\\nit required but a slight effort of fancy to connect his\\nemotion with the tender recollection of past regard\\nelinor attempted no more  but marianne in her place\\nwould not have done so little  the whole story would\\nhave been speedily formed under her active imagination\\nand every thing established in the most melancholy order\\nof disastrous love\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 12\\n\\n\\nas elinor and marianne were walking together the\\nnext morning the latter communicated a piece of news\\nto her sister which in spite of all that she knew\\nbefore of mariannes imprudence and want of thought\\nsurprised her by its extravagant testimony of both\\nmarianne told her with the greatest delight that\\nwilloughby had given her a horse one that he had bred\\nhimself on his estate in somersetshire and which was\\nexactly calculated to carry a woman  without considering\\nthat it was not in her mothers plan to keep any horse\\nthat if she were to alter her resolution in favour of\\nthis gift she must buy another for the servant and\\nkeep a servant to ride it and after all build a stable\\nto receive them she had accepted the present without\\nhesitation and told her sister of it in raptures\\n\\nhe intends to send his groom into somersetshire\\nimmediately for it she added and when it arrives we\\nwill ride every day  you shall share its use with me\\nimagine to yourself my dear elinor the delight of a gallop\\non some of these downs\\n\\nmost unwilling was she to awaken from such a dream of\\nfelicity to comprehend all the unhappy truths which attended\\nthe affair and for some time she refused to submit to them\\nas to an additional servant the expense would be a trifle\\nmamma she was sure would never object to it and any horse\\nwould do for him he might always get one at the park\\nas to a stable the merest shed would be sufficient\\nelinor then ventured to doubt the propriety of her receiving\\nsuch a present from a man so little or at least so lately\\nknown to her  this was too much\\n\\nyou are mistaken elinor said she warmly\\nin supposing i know very little of willoughby\\ni have not known him long indeed but i am much better\\nacquainted with him than i am with any other creature\\nin the world except yourself and mama  it is not\\ntime or opportunity that is to determine intimacy\\nit is disposition alone  seven years would be insufficient\\nto make some people acquainted with each other and seven\\ndays are more than enough for others  i should hold\\nmyself guilty of greater impropriety in accepting a horse\\nfrom my brother than from willoughby  of john i know\\nvery little though we have lived together for years\\nbut of willoughby my judgment has long been formed\\n\\nelinor thought it wisest to touch that point no more\\nshe knew her sisters temper  opposition on so tender a\\nsubject would only attach her the more to her own opinion\\nbut by an appeal to her affection for her mother\\nby representing the inconveniences which that indulgent\\nmother must draw on herself if as would probably be\\nthe case she consented to this increase of establishment\\nmarianne was shortly subdued and she promised not to\\ntempt her mother to such imprudent kindness by mentioning\\nthe offer and to tell willoughby when she saw him next\\nthat it must be declined\\n\\nshe was faithful to her word and when willoughby\\ncalled at the cottage the same day elinor heard her\\nexpress her disappointment to him in a low voice on\\nbeing obliged to forego the acceptance of his present\\nthe reasons for this alteration were at the same time related\\nand they were such as to make further entreaty on his\\nside impossible  his concern however was very apparent\\nand after expressing it with earnestness he added\\nin the same low voicebut marianne the horse is\\nstill yours though you cannot use it now  i shall keep\\nit only till you can claim it  when you leave barton\\nto form your own establishment in a more lasting home\\nqueen mab shall receive you\\n\\nthis was all overheard by miss dashwood and in the\\nwhole of the sentence in his manner of pronouncing it\\nand in his addressing her sister by her christian name alone\\nshe instantly saw an intimacy so decided a meaning\\nso direct as marked a perfect agreement between them\\nfrom that moment she doubted not of their being engaged\\nto each other and the belief of it created no other surprise\\nthan that she or any of their friends should be left\\nby tempers so frank to discover it by accident\\n\\nmargaret related something to her the next day\\nwhich placed this matter in a still clearer light\\nwilloughby had spent the preceding evening with them\\nand margaret by being left some time in the parlour\\nwith only him and marianne had had opportunity\\nfor observations which with a most important face\\nshe communicated to her eldest sister when they were\\nnext by themselves\\n\\noh elinor she cried i have such a secret to\\ntell you about marianne  i am sure she will be married\\nto mr willoughby very soon\\n\\nyou have said so replied elinor almost every\\nday since they first met on highchurch down and they\\nhad not known each other a week i believe before you\\nwere certain that marianne wore his picture round her neck\\nbut it turned out to be only the miniature of our great uncle\\n\\nbut indeed this is quite another thing  i am sure\\nthey will be married very soon for he has got a lock\\nof her hair\\n\\ntake care margaret  it may be only the hair\\nof some great uncle of his\\n\\nbut indeed elinor it is mariannes i am almost\\nsure it is for i saw him cut it off  last night\\nafter tea when you and mama went out of the room\\nthey were whispering and talking together as fast as\\ncould be and he seemed to be begging something of her\\nand presently he took up her scissors and cut off a long\\nlock of her hair for it was all tumbled down her back\\nand he kissed it and folded it up in a piece of white paper\\nand put it into his pocketbook\\n\\nfor such particulars stated on such authority\\nelinor could not withhold her credit nor was she disposed\\nto it for the circumstance was in perfect unison with\\nwhat she had heard and seen herself\\n\\nmargarets sagacity was not always displayed in a\\nway so satisfactory to her sister  when mrs jennings\\nattacked her one evening at the park to give the name\\nof the young man who was elinors particular favourite\\nwhich had been long a matter of great curiosity to her\\nmargaret answered by looking at her sister and saying\\ni must not tell may i elinor\\n\\nthis of course made every body laugh and elinor\\ntried to laugh too  but the effort was painful\\nshe was convinced that margaret had fixed on a person\\nwhose name she could not bear with composure to become\\na standing joke with mrs jennings\\n\\nmarianne felt for her most sincerely but she did\\nmore harm than good to the cause by turning very red\\nand saying in an angry manner to margaret\\n\\nremember that whatever your conjectures may be\\nyou have no right to repeat them\\n\\ni never had any conjectures about it replied margaret\\nit was you who told me of it yourself\\n\\nthis increased the mirth of the company and margaret\\nwas eagerly pressed to say something more\\n\\noh pray miss margaret let us know all about it\\nsaid mrs jennings  what is the gentlemans name\\n\\ni must not tell maam but i know very well what it is\\nand i know where he is too\\n\\nyes yes we can guess where he is at his own house\\nat norland to be sure  he is the curate of the parish\\ni dare say\\n\\nno that he is not  he is of no profession at all\\n\\nmargaret said marianne with great warmth\\nyou know that all this is an invention of your own\\nand that there is no such person in existence\\n\\nwell then he is lately dead marianne for i\\nam sure there was such a man once and his name begins\\nwith an f\\n\\nmost grateful did elinor feel to lady middleton\\nfor observing at this moment that it rained very hard\\nthough she believed the interruption to proceed less from\\nany attention to her than from her ladyships great dislike\\nof all such inelegant subjects of raillery as delighted\\nher husband and mother  the idea however started by her\\nwas immediately pursued by colonel brandon who was\\non every occasion mindful of the feelings of others\\nand much was said on the subject of rain by both of them\\nwilloughby opened the pianoforte and asked marianne\\nto sit down to it and thus amidst the various endeavours\\nof different people to quit the topic it fell to the ground\\nbut not so easily did elinor recover from the alarm into\\nwhich it had thrown her\\n\\na party was formed this evening for going on the\\nfollowing day to see a very fine place about twelve miles\\nfrom barton belonging to a brotherinlaw of colonel brandon\\nwithout whose interest it could not be seen as the proprietor\\nwho was then abroad had left strict orders on that head\\nthe grounds were declared to be highly beautiful\\nand sir john who was particularly warm in their praise\\nmight be allowed to be a tolerable judge for he had\\nformed parties to visit them at least twice every summer\\nfor the last ten years  they contained a noble piece\\nof water a sail on which was to a form a great part of\\nthe mornings amusement cold provisions were to be taken\\nopen carriages only to be employed and every thing\\nconducted in the usual style of a complete party of pleasure\\n\\nto some few of the company it appeared rather\\na bold undertaking considering the time of year\\nand that it had rained every day for the last fortnight\\nand mrs dashwood who had already a cold was persuaded\\nby elinor to stay at home\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 13\\n\\n\\ntheir intended excursion to whitwell turned out\\nvery different from what elinor had expected  she was\\nprepared to be wet through fatigued and frightened\\nbut the event was still more unfortunate for they did\\nnot go at all\\n\\nby ten oclock the whole party was assembled at\\nthe park where they were to breakfast  the morning\\nwas rather favourable though it had rained all night\\nas the clouds were then dispersing across the sky\\nand the sun frequently appeared  they were all in high\\nspirits and good humour eager to be happy and determined\\nto submit to the greatest inconveniences and hardships\\nrather than be otherwise\\n\\nwhile they were at breakfast the letters were brought in\\namong the rest there was one for colonel brandonhe\\ntook it looked at the direction changed colour\\nand immediately left the room\\n\\nwhat is the matter with brandon said sir john\\n\\nnobody could tell\\n\\ni hope he has had no bad news said lady middleton\\nit must be something extraordinary that could make colonel\\nbrandon leave my breakfast table so suddenly\\n\\nin about five minutes he returned\\n\\nno bad news colonel i hope said mrs jennings\\nas soon as he entered the room\\n\\nnone at all maam i thank you\\n\\nwas it from avignon  i hope it is not to say\\nthat your sister is worse\\n\\nno maam it came from town and is merely\\na letter of business\\n\\nbut how came the hand to discompose you so much\\nif it was only a letter of business  come come\\nthis wont do colonel so let us hear the truth of it\\n\\nmy dear madam said lady middleton recollect what\\nyou are saying\\n\\nperhaps it is to tell you that your cousin fanny\\nis married said mrs jennings without attending\\nto her daughters reproof\\n\\nno indeed it is not\\n\\nwell then i know who it is from colonel  and i\\nhope she is well\\n\\nwhom do you mean maam said he colouring a little\\n\\noh you know who i mean\\n\\ni am particularly sorry maam said he\\naddressing lady middleton that i should receive this\\nletter today for it is on business which requires\\nmy immediate attendance in town\\n\\nin town cried mrs jennings  what can you\\nhave to do in town at this time of year\\n\\nmy own loss is great be continued in being obliged\\nto leave so agreeable a party but i am the more concerned\\nas i fear my presence is necessary to gain your admittance\\nat whitwell\\n\\nwhat a blow upon them all was this\\n\\nbut if you write a note to the housekeeper mr brandon\\nsaid marianne eagerly will it not be sufficient\\n\\nhe shook his head\\n\\nwe must go said sir johnit shall not be put\\noff when we are so near it  you cannot go to town till\\ntomorrow brandon that is all\\n\\ni wish it could be so easily settled  but it\\nis not in my power to delay my journey for one day\\n\\nif you would but let us know what your business is\\nsaid mrs jennings we might see whether it could be put\\noff or not\\n\\nyou would not be six hours later said willoughby\\nif you were to defer your journey till our return\\n\\ni cannot afford to lose one hour\\n\\nelinor then heard willoughby say in a low voice to marianne\\nthere are some people who cannot bear a party of pleasure\\nbrandon is one of them  he was afraid of catching cold\\ni dare say and invented this trick for getting out of it\\ni would lay fifty guineas the letter was of his own writing\\n\\ni have no doubt of it replied marianne\\n\\nthere is no persuading you to change your mind\\nbrandon i know of old said sir john when once you\\nare determined on anything  but however i hope you\\nwill think better of it  consider here are the two miss\\ncareys come over from newton the three miss dashwoods\\nwalked up from the cottage and mr willoughby got up\\ntwo hours before his usual time on purpose to go to whitwell\\n\\ncolonel brandon again repeated his sorrow at being\\nthe cause of disappointing the party but at the same\\ntime declared it to be unavoidable\\n\\nwell then when will you come back again\\n\\ni hope we shall see you at barton added her ladyship\\nas soon as you can conveniently leave town and we must\\nput off the party to whitwell till you return\\n\\nyou are very obliging  but it is so uncertain\\nwhen i may have it in my power to return that i dare\\nnot engage for it at all\\n\\noh he must and shall come back cried sir john\\nif he is not here by the end of the week i shall go\\nafter him\\n\\nay so do sir john cried mrs jennings and then\\nperhaps you may find out what his business is\\n\\ni do not want to pry into other mens concerns\\ni suppose it is something he is ashamed of\\n\\ncolonel brandons horses were announced\\n\\nyou do not go to town on horseback do you\\nadded sir john\\n\\nno only to honiton  i shall then go post\\n\\nwell as you are resolved to go i wish you\\na good journey  but you had better change your mind\\n\\ni assure you it is not in my power\\n\\nhe then took leave of the whole party\\n\\nis there no chance of my seeing you and your sisters\\nin town this winter miss dashwood\\n\\ni am afraid none at all\\n\\nthen i must bid you farewell for a longer time\\nthan i should wish to do\\n\\nto marianne he merely bowed and said nothing\\n\\ncome colonel said mrs jennings before you go\\ndo let us know what you are going about\\n\\nhe wished her a good morning and attended by sir john\\nleft the room\\n\\nthe complaints and lamentations which politeness\\nhad hitherto restrained now burst forth universally\\nand they all agreed again and again how provoking it was\\nto be so disappointed\\n\\ni can guess what his business is however\\nsaid mrs jennings exultingly\\n\\ncan you maam said almost every body\\n\\nyes it is about miss williams i am sure\\n\\nand who is miss williams asked marianne\\n\\nwhat do not you know who miss williams is i am\\nsure you must have heard of her before  she is a relation\\nof the colonels my dear a very near relation  we will\\nnot say how near for fear of shocking the young ladies\\nthen lowering her voice a little she said to elinor\\nshe is his natural daughter\\n\\nindeed\\n\\noh yes and as like him as she can stare\\ni dare say the colonel will leave her all his fortune\\n\\nwhen sir john returned he joined most heartily\\nin the general regret on so unfortunate an event\\nconcluding however by observing that as they were\\nall got together they must do something by way of\\nbeing happy and after some consultation it was agreed\\nthat although happiness could only be enjoyed at whitwell\\nthey might procure a tolerable composure of mind by driving\\nabout the country  the carriages were then ordered\\nwilloughbys was first and marianne never looked\\nhappier than when she got into it  he drove through\\nthe park very fast and they were soon out of sight\\nand nothing more of them was seen till their return\\nwhich did not happen till after the return of all the rest\\nthey both seemed delighted with their drive but said\\nonly in general terms that they had kept in the lanes\\nwhile the others went on the downs\\n\\nit was settled that there should be a dance in the evening\\nand that every body should be extremely merry all day long\\nsome more of the careys came to dinner and they had the\\npleasure of sitting down nearly twenty to table which sir\\njohn observed with great contentment  willoughby took\\nhis usual place between the two elder miss dashwoods\\nmrs jennings sat on elinors right hand and they had not\\nbeen long seated before she leant behind her and willoughby\\nand said to marianne loud enough for them both to hear\\ni have found you out in spite of all your tricks\\ni know where you spent the morning\\n\\nmarianne coloured and replied very hastily\\nwhere pray\\n\\ndid not you know said willoughby that we had\\nbeen out in my curricle\\n\\nyes yes mr impudence i know that very well\\nand i was determined to find out where you had been to\\ni hope you like your house miss marianne  it is a very\\nlarge one i know and when i come to see you i hope you\\nwill have newfurnished it for it wanted it very much\\nwhen i was there six years ago\\n\\nmarianne turned away in great confusion\\nmrs jennings laughed heartily and elinor found that in her\\nresolution to know where they had been she had actually\\nmade her own woman enquire of mr willoughbys groom\\nand that she had by that method been informed that they\\nhad gone to allenham and spent a considerable time there\\nin walking about the garden and going all over the house\\n\\nelinor could hardly believe this to be true\\nas it seemed very unlikely that willoughby should propose\\nor marianne consent to enter the house while mrs smith was\\nin it with whom marianne had not the smallest acquaintance\\n\\nas soon as they left the diningroom elinor enquired\\nof her about it and great was her surprise when she\\nfound that every circumstance related by mrs jennings\\nwas perfectly true  marianne was quite angry with her\\nfor doubting it\\n\\nwhy should you imagine elinor that we did not\\ngo there or that we did not see the house  is not it\\nwhat you have often wished to do yourself\\n\\nyes marianne but i would not go while mrs smith\\nwas there and with no other companion than mr willoughby\\n\\nmr willoughby however is the only person who can\\nhave a right to shew that house and as he went in an open\\ncarriage it was impossible to have any other companion\\ni never spent a pleasanter morning in my life\\n\\ni am afraid replied elinor that the pleasantness\\nof an employment does not always evince its propriety\\n\\non the contrary nothing can be a stronger proof\\nof it elinor for if there had been any real impropriety\\nin what i did i should have been sensible of it at\\nthe time for we always know when we are acting wrong\\nand with such a conviction i could have had no pleasure\\n\\nbut my dear marianne as it has already exposed you\\nto some very impertinent remarks do you not now begin\\nto doubt the discretion of your own conduct\\n\\nif the impertinent remarks of mrs jennings are\\nto be the proof of impropriety in conduct we are all\\noffending every moment of our lives  i value not her\\ncensure any more than i should do her commendation\\ni am not sensible of having done anything wrong in walking\\nover mrs smiths grounds or in seeing her house\\nthey will one day be mr willoughbys and\\n\\nif they were one day to be your own marianne\\nyou would not be justified in what you have done\\n\\nshe blushed at this hint but it was even visibly\\ngratifying to her and after a ten minutes interval of\\nearnest thought she came to her sister again and said\\nwith great good humour perhaps elinor it was rather\\nilljudged in me to go to allenham but mr willoughby wanted\\nparticularly to shew me the place and it is a charming house\\ni assure youthere is one remarkably pretty sitting room\\nup stairs of a nice comfortable size for constant use\\nand with modern furniture it would be delightful\\nit is a corner room and has windows on two sides\\non one side you look across the bowlinggreen behind\\nthe house to a beautiful hanging wood and on the other you\\nhave a view of the church and village and beyond them\\nof those fine bold hills that we have so often admired\\ni did not see it to advantage for nothing could be\\nmore forlorn than the furniturebut if it were newly\\nfitted upa couple of hundred pounds willoughby says\\nwould make it one of the pleasantest summerrooms\\nin england\\n\\ncould elinor have listened to her without interruption\\nfrom the others she would have described every room\\nin the house with equal delight\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 14\\n\\n\\nthe sudden termination of colonel brandons visit\\nat the park with his steadiness in concealing its cause\\nfilled the mind and raised the wonder of mrs jennings\\nfor two or three days she was a great wonderer as every\\none must be who takes a very lively interest in all the\\ncomings and goings of all their acquaintance  she wondered\\nwith little intermission what could be the reason of it\\nwas sure there must be some bad news and thought over\\nevery kind of distress that could have befallen him\\nwith a fixed determination that he should not escape\\nthem all\\n\\nsomething very melancholy must be the matter\\ni am sure said she  i could see it in his face\\npoor man  i am afraid his circumstances may be bad\\nthe estate at delaford was never reckoned more than two thousand\\na year and his brother left everything sadly involved\\ni do think he must have been sent for about money matters\\nfor what else can it be  i wonder whether it is so\\ni would give anything to know the truth of it  perhaps it\\nis about miss williams and by the bye i dare say it is\\nbecause he looked so conscious when i mentioned her\\nmay be she is ill in town nothing in the world more likely\\nfor i have a notion she is always rather sickly\\ni would lay any wager it is about miss williams\\nit is not so very likely he should be distressed in\\nhis circumstances now for he is a very prudent man\\nand to be sure must have cleared the estate by this time\\ni wonder what it can be  may be his sister is worse\\nat avignon and has sent for him over  his setting off\\nin such a hurry seems very like it  well i wish him out\\nof all his trouble with all my heart and a good wife into\\nthe bargain\\n\\nso wondered so talked mrs jennings  her opinion\\nvarying with every fresh conjecture and all seeming\\nequally probable as they arose  elinor though she felt\\nreally interested in the welfare of colonel brandon\\ncould not bestow all the wonder on his going so suddenly\\naway which mrs jennings was desirous of her feeling\\nfor besides that the circumstance did not in her opinion\\njustify such lasting amazement or variety of speculation\\nher wonder was otherwise disposed of  it was engrossed\\nby the extraordinary silence of her sister and willoughby\\non the subject which they must know to be peculiarly\\ninteresting to them all  as this silence continued\\nevery day made it appear more strange and more incompatible\\nwith the disposition of both  why they should not openly\\nacknowledge to her mother and herself what their constant\\nbehaviour to each other declared to have taken place\\nelinor could not imagine\\n\\nshe could easily conceive that marriage might not\\nbe immediately in their power for though willoughby\\nwas independent there was no reason to believe him rich\\nhis estate had been rated by sir john at about six or seven\\nhundred a year but he lived at an expense to which that income\\ncould hardly be equal and he had himself often complained\\nof his poverty  but for this strange kind of secrecy\\nmaintained by them relative to their engagement which\\nin fact concealed nothing at all she could not account\\nand it was so wholly contradictory to their general\\nopinions and practice that a doubt sometimes entered\\nher mind of their being really engaged and this doubt\\nwas enough to prevent her making any inquiry of marianne\\n\\nnothing could be more expressive of attachment\\nto them all than willoughbys behaviour  to marianne\\nit had all the distinguishing tenderness which a lovers\\nheart could give and to the rest of the family it was the\\naffectionate attention of a son and a brother  the cottage\\nseemed to be considered and loved by him as his home\\nmany more of his hours were spent there than at allenham\\nand if no general engagement collected them at the park\\nthe exercise which called him out in the morning was\\nalmost certain of ending there where the rest of the day\\nwas spent by himself at the side of marianne and by his\\nfavourite pointer at her feet\\n\\none evening in particular about a week after\\ncolonel brandon left the country his heart seemed\\nmore than usually open to every feeling of attachment\\nto the objects around him and on mrs dashwoods\\nhappening to mention her design of improving the cottage\\nin the spring he warmly opposed every alteration\\nof a place which affection had established as perfect with him\\n\\nwhat he exclaimedimprove this dear cottage\\nno that i will never consent to  not a stone must\\nbe added to its walls not an inch to its size\\nif my feelings are regarded\\n\\ndo not be alarmed said miss dashwood\\nnothing of the kind will be done for my mother\\nwill never have money enough to attempt it\\n\\ni am heartily glad of it he cried  may she\\nalways be poor if she can employ her riches no better\\n\\nthank you willoughby  but you may be assured that i\\nwould not sacrifice one sentiment of local attachment\\nof yours or of any one whom i loved for all the improvements\\nin the world  depend upon it that whatever unemployed\\nsum may remain when i make up my accounts in the spring\\ni would even rather lay it uselessly by than dispose\\nof it in a manner so painful to you  but are you really\\nso attached to this place as to see no defect in it\\n\\ni am said he  to me it is faultless  nay more\\ni consider it as the only form of building in which happiness\\nis attainable and were i rich enough i would instantly pull\\ncombe down and build it up again in the exact plan of this\\ncottage\\n\\nwith dark narrow stairs and a kitchen that smokes\\ni suppose said elinor\\n\\nyes cried he in the same eager tone with all\\nand every thing belonging to itin no one convenience\\nor inconvenience about it should the least variation\\nbe perceptible  then and then only under such a roof i\\nmight perhaps be as happy at combe as i have been at barton\\n\\ni flatter myself replied elinor that even under\\nthe disadvantage of better rooms and a broader staircase\\nyou will hereafter find your own house as faultless as you\\nnow do this\\n\\nthere certainly are circumstances said willoughby\\nwhich might greatly endear it to me but this place will\\nalways have one claim of my affection which no other can\\npossibly share\\n\\nmrs dashwood looked with pleasure at marianne\\nwhose fine eyes were fixed so expressively on willoughby\\nas plainly denoted how well she understood him\\n\\nhow often did i wish added he when i was at\\nallenham this time twelvemonth that barton cottage were\\ninhabited  i never passed within view of it without admiring\\nits situation and grieving that no one should live in it\\nhow little did i then think that the very first news\\ni should hear from mrs smith when i next came into\\nthe country would be that barton cottage was taken and i\\nfelt an immediate satisfaction and interest in the event\\nwhich nothing but a kind of prescience of what happiness i\\nshould experience from it can account for  must it not have\\nbeen so marianne speaking to her in a lowered voice\\nthen continuing his former tone he said and yet this\\nhouse you would spoil mrs dashwood  you would rob it\\nof its simplicity by imaginary improvement and this dear\\nparlour in which our acquaintance first began and in which\\nso many happy hours have been since spent by us together\\nyou would degrade to the condition of a common entrance\\nand every body would be eager to pass through the room\\nwhich has hitherto contained within itself more real\\naccommodation and comfort than any other apartment of\\nthe handsomest dimensions in the world could possibly afford\\n\\nmrs dashwood again assured him that no alteration\\nof the kind should be attempted\\n\\nyou are a good woman he warmly replied\\nyour promise makes me easy  extend it a little farther\\nand it will make me happy  tell me that not only your\\nhouse will remain the same but that i shall ever find\\nyou and yours as unchanged as your dwelling and that you\\nwill always consider me with the kindness which has made\\neverything belonging to you so dear to me\\n\\nthe promise was readily given and willoughbys\\nbehaviour during the whole of the evening declared\\nat once his affection and happiness\\n\\nshall we see you tomorrow to dinner said mrs dashwood\\nwhen he was leaving them  i do not ask you to come in\\nthe morning for we must walk to the park to call on lady\\nmiddleton\\n\\nhe engaged to be with them by four oclock\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 15\\n\\n\\nmrs dashwoods visit to lady middleton took place\\nthe next day and two of her daughters went with her\\nbut marianne excused herself from being of the party\\nunder some trifling pretext of employment and her mother\\nwho concluded that a promise had been made by willoughby\\nthe night before of calling on her while they were absent\\nwas perfectly satisfied with her remaining at home\\n\\non their return from the park they found willoughbys\\ncurricle and servant in waiting at the cottage\\nand mrs dashwood was convinced that her conjecture\\nhad been just  so far it was all as she had foreseen\\nbut on entering the house she beheld what no foresight\\nhad taught her to expect  they were no sooner in the\\npassage than marianne came hastily out of the parlour\\napparently in violent affliction with her handkerchief\\nat her eyes and without noticing them ran up stairs\\nsurprised and alarmed they proceeded directly into the room\\nshe had just quitted where they found only willoughby\\nwho was leaning against the mantelpiece with his back\\ntowards them  he turned round on their coming in\\nand his countenance shewed that he strongly partook\\nof the emotion which overpowered marianne\\n\\nis anything the matter with her cried mrs dashwood\\nas she enteredis she ill\\n\\ni hope not he replied trying to look cheerful\\nand with a forced smile presently added it is i who may\\nrather expect to be illfor i am now suffering under a\\nvery heavy disappointment\\n\\ndisappointment\\n\\nyes for i am unable to keep my engagement with you\\nmrs smith has this morning exercised the privilege\\nof riches upon a poor dependent cousin by sending me on\\nbusiness to london  i have just received my dispatches\\nand taken my farewell of allenham and by way of exhilaration\\ni am now come to take my farewell of you\\n\\nto londonand are you going this morning\\n\\nalmost this moment\\n\\nthis is very unfortunate  but mrs smith must\\nbe obligedand her business will not detain you from\\nus long i hope\\n\\nhe coloured as he replied you are very kind but i\\nhave no idea of returning into devonshire immediately\\nmy visits to mrs smith are never repeated within\\nthe twelvemonth\\n\\nand is mrs smith your only friend  is allenham the only\\nhouse in the neighbourhood to which you will be welcome\\nfor shame willoughby can you wait for an invitation here\\n\\nhis colour increased and with his eyes fixed\\non the ground he only replied you are too good\\n\\nmrs dashwood looked at elinor with surprise\\nelinor felt equal amazement  for a few moments every one\\nwas silent  mrs dashwood first spoke\\n\\ni have only to add my dear willoughby that at\\nbarton cottage you will always be welcome for i will not\\npress you to return here immediately because you only\\ncan judge how far that might be pleasing to mrs smith\\nand on this head i shall be no more disposed to question\\nyour judgment than to doubt your inclination\\n\\nmy engagements at present replied willoughby\\nconfusedly are of such a naturethati dare not flatter\\nmyself\\n\\nhe stopt  mrs dashwood was too much astonished\\nto speak and another pause succeeded  this was broken\\nby willoughby who said with a faint smile it is folly\\nto linger in this manner  i will not torment myself\\nany longer by remaining among friends whose society\\nit is impossible for me now to enjoy\\n\\nhe then hastily took leave of them all and left\\nthe room  they saw him step into his carriage\\nand in a minute it was out of sight\\n\\nmrs dashwood felt too much for speech and instantly\\nquitted the parlour to give way in solitude to the concern\\nand alarm which this sudden departure occasioned\\n\\nelinors uneasiness was at least equal to her mothers\\nshe thought of what had just passed with anxiety and distrust\\nwilloughbys behaviour in taking leave of them his\\nembarrassment\\nand affectation of cheerfulness and above all his\\nunwillingness\\nto accept her mothers invitation a backwardness so unlike a\\nlover\\nso unlike himself greatly disturbed her  one moment she feared\\nthat no serious design had ever been formed on his side and the\\nnext that some unfortunate quarrel had taken place between him\\nand\\nher sisterthe distress in which marianne had quitted the room\\nwas such as a serious quarrel could most reasonably account for\\nthough when she considered what mariannes love for him was\\na quarrel seemed almost impossible\\n\\nbut whatever might be the particulars of their separation\\nher sisters affliction was indubitable and she thought\\nwith the tenderest compassion of that violent sorrow\\nwhich marianne was in all probability not merely giving\\nway to as a relief but feeding and encouraging as a duty\\n\\nin about half an hour her mother returned and though\\nher eyes were red her countenance was not uncheerful\\n\\nour dear willoughby is now some miles from barton elinor\\nsaid she as she sat down to work and with how heavy a heart\\ndoes he travel\\n\\nit is all very strange  so suddenly to be gone it\\nseems but the work of a moment  and last night he was\\nwith us so happy so cheerful so affectionate  and now\\nafter only ten minutes noticegone too without intending\\nto returnsomething more than what be owned to us must\\nhave happened  he did not speak he did not behave\\nlike himself  you must have seen the difference as well as i\\nwhat can it be  can they have quarrelled  why else should he\\nhave shewn such unwillingness to accept your invitation here\\n\\nit was not inclination that he wanted elinor i could\\nplainly see that  he had not the power of accepting it\\ni have thought it all over i assure you and i can\\nperfectly account for every thing that at first seemed\\nstrange to me as well as to you\\n\\ncan you indeed\\n\\nyes i have explained it to myself in the most\\nsatisfactory waybut you elinor who love to doubt\\nwhere you canit will not satisfy you i know but you\\nshall not talk me out of my trust in it  i am persuaded\\nthat mrs smith suspects his regard for marianne\\ndisapproves of it perhaps because she has other views\\nfor him and on that account is eager to get him away\\nand that the business which she sends him off to transact\\nis invented as an excuse to dismiss him  this is what i\\nbelieve to have happened  he is moreover aware that she\\ndoes disapprove the connection he dares not therefore\\nat present confess to her his engagement with marianne\\nand he feels himself obliged from his dependent situation\\nto give into her schemes and absent himself from\\ndevonshire for a while  you will tell me i know\\nthat this may or may not have happened but i will listen\\nto no cavil unless you can point out any other method\\nof understanding the affair as satisfactory at this\\nand now elinor what have you to say\\n\\nnothing for you have anticipated my answer\\n\\nthen you would have told me that it might or might not\\nhave happened  oh elinor how incomprehensible are your\\nfeelings  you had rather take evil upon credit than good\\nyou had rather look out for misery for marianne and guilt\\nfor poor willoughby than an apology for the latter\\nyou are resolved to think him blameable because he took\\nleave of us with less affection than his usual behaviour\\nhas shewn  and is no allowance to be made for inadvertence\\nor for spirits depressed by recent disappointment  are\\nno probabilities to be accepted merely because they\\nare not certainties  is nothing due to the man whom we\\nhave all such reason to love and no reason in the world\\nto think ill of  to the possibility of motives unanswerable\\nin themselves though unavoidably secret for a while  and\\nafter all what is it you suspect him of\\n\\ni can hardly tell myself  but suspicion of\\nsomething unpleasant is the inevitable consequence\\nof such an alteration as we just witnessed in him\\nthere is great truth however in what you have now urged\\nof the allowances which ought to be made for him and it\\nis my wish to be candid in my judgment of every body\\nwilloughby may undoubtedly have very sufficient\\nreasons for his conduct and i will hope that he has\\nbut it would have been more like willoughby to acknowledge\\nthem at once  secrecy may be advisable but still i\\ncannot help wondering at its being practiced by him\\n\\ndo not blame him however for departing from\\nhis character where the deviation is necessary\\nbut you really do admit the justice of what i have said\\nin his defencei am happyand he is acquitted\\n\\nnot entirely  it may be proper to conceal their\\nengagement if they are engaged from mrs smith\\nand if that is the case it must be highly expedient\\nfor willoughby to be but little in devonshire at present\\nbut this is no excuse for their concealing it from us\\n\\nconcealing it from us my dear child do you accuse\\nwilloughby and marianne of concealment this is strange\\nindeed when your eyes have been reproaching them every day\\nfor incautiousness\\n\\ni want no proof of their affection said elinor\\nbut of their engagement i do\\n\\ni am perfectly satisfied of both\\n\\nyet not a syllable has been said to you on the\\nsubject by either of them\\n\\ni have not wanted syllables where actions have\\nspoken so plainly  has not his behaviour to marianne\\nand to all of us for at least the last fortnight\\ndeclared that he loved and considered her as his future wife\\nand that he felt for us the attachment of the nearest\\nrelation  have we not perfectly understood each other\\nhas not my consent been daily asked by his looks his manner\\nhis attentive and affectionate respect  my elinor\\nis it possible to doubt their engagement  how could\\nsuch a thought occur to you  how is it to be supposed\\nthat willoughby persuaded as he must be of your\\nsisters love should leave her and leave her perhaps\\nfor months without telling her of his affectionthat\\nthey should part without a mutual exchange of confidence\\n\\ni confess replied elinor that every circumstance\\nexcept one is in favour of their engagement\\nbut that one is the total silence of both on the subject\\nand with me it almost outweighs every other\\n\\nhow strange this is  you must think wretchedly indeed\\nof willoughby if after all that has openly passed between them\\nyou can doubt the nature of the terms on which they are together\\nhas he been acting a part in his behaviour to your sister\\nall this time  do you suppose him really indifferent to her\\n\\nno i cannot think that  he must and does love her\\ni am sure\\n\\nbut with a strange kind of tenderness if he can\\nleave her with such indifference such carelessness\\nof the future as you attribute to him\\n\\nyou must remember my dear mother that i have never\\nconsidered this matter as certain  i have had my doubts\\ni confess but they are fainter than they were and they\\nmay soon be entirely done away  if we find they correspond\\nevery fear of mine will be removed\\n\\na mighty concession indeed  if you were to see\\nthem at the altar you would suppose they were going to\\nbe married  ungracious girl  but i require no such proof\\nnothing in my opinion has ever passed to justify doubt\\nno secrecy has been attempted all has been uniformly open\\nand unreserved  you cannot doubt your sisters wishes\\nit must be willoughby therefore whom you suspect  but why\\nis he not a man of honour and feeling has there been any\\ninconsistency on his side to create alarm can he be deceitful\\n\\ni hope not i believe not cried elinor\\ni love willoughby sincerely love him and suspicion of his\\nintegrity cannot be more painful to yourself than to me\\nit has been involuntary and i will not encourage it\\ni was startled i confess by the alteration in his\\nmanners this morninghe did not speak like himself\\nand did not return your kindness with any cordiality\\nbut all this may be explained by such a situation of his\\naffairs as you have supposed  he had just parted from\\nmy sister had seen her leave him in the greatest affliction\\nand if he felt obliged from a fear of offending mrs smith\\nto resist the temptation of returning here soon and yet\\naware that by declining your invitation by saying\\nthat he was going away for some time he should seem\\nto act an ungenerous a suspicious part by our family\\nbe might well be embarrassed and disturbed  in such a case\\na plain and open avowal of his difficulties would have been\\nmore to his honour i think as well as more consistent\\nwith his general characterbut i will not raise objections\\nagainst any ones conduct on so illiberal a foundation\\nas a difference in judgment from myself or a deviation from\\nwhat i may think right and consistent\\n\\nyou speak very properly  willoughby certainly does\\nnot deserve to be suspected  though we have not known\\nhim long he is no stranger in this part of the world\\nand who has ever spoken to his disadvantage  had he been\\nin a situation to act independently and marry immediately\\nit might have been odd that he should leave us without\\nacknowledging everything to me at once but this is not the case\\nit is an engagement in some respects not prosperously begun\\nfor their marriage must be at a very uncertain distance\\nand even secrecy as far as it can be observed may now\\nbe very advisable\\n\\nthey were interrupted by the entrance of margaret\\nand elinor was then at liberty to think over the representations\\nof her mother to acknowledge the probability of many\\nand hope for the justice of all\\n\\nthey saw nothing of marianne till dinner time\\nwhen she entered the room and took her place at the table\\nwithout saying a word  her eyes were red and swollen\\nand it seemed as if her tears were even then restrained\\nwith difficulty  she avoided the looks of them all\\ncould neither eat nor speak and after some time on her\\nmothers silently pressing her hand with tender compassion\\nher small degree of fortitude was quite overcome she burst\\ninto tears and left the room\\n\\nthis violent oppression of spirits continued the\\nwhole evening  she was without any power because she\\nwas without any desire of command over herself\\nthe slightest mention of anything relative to willoughby\\noverpowered her in an instant and though her family\\nwere most anxiously attentive to her comfort it was\\nimpossible for them if they spoke at all to keep clear\\nof every subject which her feelings connected with him\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 16\\n\\n\\nmarianne would have thought herself very inexcusable\\nhad she been able to sleep at all the first night\\nafter parting from willoughby  she would have been\\nashamed to look her family in the face the next morning\\nhad she not risen from her bed in more need of repose\\nthan when she lay down in it  but the feelings which\\nmade such composure a disgrace left her in no danger\\nof incurring it  she was awake the whole night and she\\nwept the greatest part of it  she got up with a headache\\nwas unable to talk and unwilling to take any nourishment\\ngiving pain every moment to her mother and sisters\\nand forbidding all attempt at consolation from either\\nher sensibility was potent enough\\n\\nwhen breakfast was over she walked out by herself\\nand wandered about the village of allenham indulging the\\nrecollection of past enjoyment and crying over the present\\nreverse for the chief of the morning\\n\\nthe evening passed off in the equal indulgence of feeling\\nshe played over every favourite song that she had been used\\nto play to willoughby every air in which their voices\\nhad been oftenest joined and sat at the instrument gazing\\non every line of music that he had written out for her\\ntill her heart was so heavy that no farther sadness\\ncould be gained and this nourishment of grief was every\\nday applied  she spent whole hours at the pianoforte\\nalternately singing and crying her voice often totally\\nsuspended by her tears  in books too as well as in music\\nshe courted the misery which a contrast between the past\\nand present was certain of giving  she read nothing\\nbut what they had been used to read together\\n\\nsuch violence of affliction indeed could not be supported\\nfor ever it sunk within a few days into a calmer melancholy\\nbut these employments to which she daily recurred\\nher solitary walks and silent meditations still produced\\noccasional effusions of sorrow as lively as ever\\n\\nno letter from willoughby came and none seemed expected\\nby marianne  her mother was surprised and elinor again\\nbecame uneasy  but mrs dashwood could find explanations\\nwhenever she wanted them which at least satisfied herself\\n\\nremember elinor said she how very often sir john\\nfetches our letters himself from the post and carries them\\nto it  we have already agreed that secrecy may be necessary\\nand we must acknowledge that it could not be maintained if\\ntheir correspondence were to pass through sir johns hands\\n\\nelinor could not deny the truth of this and she tried\\nto find in it a motive sufficient for their silence\\nbut there was one method so direct so simple and in\\nher opinion so eligible of knowing the real state\\nof the affair and of instantly removing all mystery\\nthat she could not help suggesting it to her mother\\n\\nwhy do you not ask marianne at once said she\\nwhether she is or she is not engaged to willoughby  from you\\nher mother and so kind so indulgent a mother the question\\ncould not give offence  it would be the natural result\\nof your affection for her  she used to be all unreserve\\nand to you more especially\\n\\ni would not ask such a question for the world\\nsupposing it possible that they are not engaged\\nwhat distress would not such an enquiry inflict  at any\\nrate it would be most ungenerous  i should never deserve\\nher confidence again after forcing from her a confession\\nof what is meant at present to be unacknowledged to any one\\ni know mariannes heart i know that she dearly loves me\\nand that i shall not be the last to whom the affair is made\\nknown\\nwhen circumstances make the revealment of it eligible\\ni would not attempt to force the confidence of any one\\nof a child much less because a sense of duty would prevent\\nthe denial which her wishes might direct\\n\\nelinor thought this generosity overstrained\\nconsidering her sisters youth and urged the matter farther\\nbut in vain common sense common care common prudence\\nwere all sunk in mrs dashwoods romantic delicacy\\n\\nit was several days before willoughbys name\\nwas mentioned before marianne by any of her family\\nsir john and mrs jennings indeed were not so nice\\ntheir witticisms added pain to many a painful hour\\nbut one evening mrs dashwood accidentally taking up a\\nvolume of shakespeare exclaimed\\n\\nwe have never finished hamlet marianne our dear\\nwilloughby went away before we could get through it\\nwe will put it by that when he comes againbut it may\\nbe months perhaps before that happens\\n\\nmonths cried marianne with strong surprise\\nnonor many weeks\\n\\nmrs dashwood was sorry for what she had said\\nbut it gave elinor pleasure as it produced a reply\\nfrom marianne so expressive of confidence in willoughby\\nand knowledge of his intentions\\n\\none morning about a week after his leaving the country\\nmarianne was prevailed on to join her sisters in their\\nusual walk instead of wandering away by herself\\nhitherto she had carefully avoided every companion in\\nher rambles  if her sisters intended to walk on the downs\\nshe directly stole away towards the lanes if they talked\\nof the valley she was as speedy in climbing the hills\\nand could never be found when the others set off\\nbut at length she was secured by the exertions of elinor\\nwho greatly disapproved such continual seclusion  they walked\\nalong the road through the valley and chiefly in silence\\nfor mariannes mind could not be controlled and elinor\\nsatisfied with gaining one point would not then attempt more\\nbeyond the entrance of the valley where the country\\nthough still rich was less wild and more open a long\\nstretch of the road which they had travelled on first coming\\nto barton lay before them and on reaching that point\\nthey stopped to look around them and examine a prospect\\nwhich formed the distance of their view from the cottage\\nfrom a spot which they had never happened to reach in any\\nof their walks before\\n\\namongst the objects in the scene they soon discovered\\nan animated one it was a man on horseback riding towards them\\nin a few minutes they could distinguish him to be a gentleman\\nand in a moment afterwards marianne rapturously exclaimed\\n\\nit is he it is indeedi know it isand was\\nhastening to meet him when elinor cried out\\n\\nindeed marianne i think you are mistaken  it is\\nnot willoughby  the person is not tall enough for him\\nand has not his air\\n\\nhe has he has cried marianne i am sure he has\\nhis air his coat his horse  i knew how soon he would come\\n\\nshe walked eagerly on as she spoke and elinor\\nto screen marianne from particularity as she felt almost\\ncertain of its not being willoughby quickened her\\npace and kept up with her  they were soon within\\nthirty yards of the gentleman  marianne looked again\\nher heart sunk within her and abruptly turning round\\nshe was hurrying back when the voices of both her sisters\\nwere raised to detain her a third almost as well known\\nas willoughbys joined them in begging her to stop\\nand she turned round with surprise to see and welcome\\nedward ferrars\\n\\nhe was the only person in the world who could\\nat that moment be forgiven for not being willoughby\\nthe only one who could have gained a smile from her\\nbut she dispersed her tears to smile on him and in her\\nsisters happiness forgot for a time her own disappointment\\n\\nhe dismounted and giving his horse to his servant\\nwalked back with them to barton whither he was purposely\\ncoming to visit them\\n\\nhe was welcomed by them all with great cordiality\\nbut especially by marianne who showed more warmth of\\nregard in her reception of him than even elinor herself\\nto marianne indeed the meeting between edward and her sister\\nwas but a continuation of that unaccountable coldness which she\\nhad often observed at norland in their mutual behaviour\\non edwards side more particularly there was a deficiency\\nof all that a lover ought to look and say on such an occasion\\nhe was confused seemed scarcely sensible of pleasure\\nin seeing them looked neither rapturous nor gay\\nsaid little but what was forced from him by questions\\nand distinguished elinor by no mark of affection\\nmarianne saw and listened with increasing surprise\\nshe began almost to feel a dislike of edward and it ended\\nas every feeling must end with her by carrying back her\\nthoughts to willoughby whose manners formed a contrast\\nsufficiently striking to those of his brother elect\\n\\nafter a short silence which succeeded the first\\nsurprise and enquiries of meeting marianne asked\\nedward if he came directly from london  no he had\\nbeen in devonshire a fortnight\\n\\na fortnight she repeated surprised at his being\\nso long in the same county with elinor without seeing\\nher before\\n\\nhe looked rather distressed as he added that he\\nhad been staying with some friends near plymouth\\n\\nhave you been lately in sussex said elinor\\n\\ni was at norland about a month ago\\n\\nand how does dear dear norland look cried marianne\\n\\ndear dear norland said elinor probably looks\\nmuch as it always does at this time of the year\\nthe woods and walks thickly covered with dead leaves\\n\\noh cried marianne with what transporting sensation\\nhave i formerly seen them fall  how have i delighted\\nas i walked to see them driven in showers about me\\nby the wind  what feelings have they the season the air\\naltogether inspired  now there is no one to regard them\\nthey are seen only as a nuisance swept hastily off\\nand driven as much as possible from the sight\\n\\nit is not every one said elinor who has your\\npassion for dead leaves\\n\\nno my feelings are not often shared not often\\nunderstood  but sometimes they areas she said this\\nshe sunk into a reverie for a few momentsbut rousing\\nherself again now edward said she calling his attention\\nto the prospect here is barton valley  look up to it\\nand be tranquil if you can  look at those hills\\ndid you ever see their equals  to the left is barton park\\namongst those woods and plantations  you may see the end\\nof the house  and there beneath that farthest hill\\nwhich rises with such grandeur is our cottage\\n\\nit is a beautiful country he replied but these\\nbottoms must be dirty in winter\\n\\nhow can you think of dirt with such objects before you\\n\\nbecause replied he smiling among the rest of the\\nobjects before me i see a very dirty lane\\n\\nhow strange said marianne to herself as she walked on\\n\\nhave you an agreeable neighbourhood here  are the\\nmiddletons pleasant people\\n\\nno not all answered marianne we could not\\nbe more unfortunately situated\\n\\nmarianne cried her sister how can you say so how can\\nyou be so unjust  they are a very respectable family mr\\nferrars\\nand towards us have behaved in the friendliest manner  have you\\nforgot marianne how many pleasant days we have owed to them\\n\\nno said marianne in a low voice nor how many\\npainful moments\\n\\nelinor took no notice of this and directing\\nher attention to their visitor endeavoured to support\\nsomething like discourse with him by talking of their\\npresent residence its conveniences c extorting from him\\noccasional questions and remarks  his coldness and reserve\\nmortified her severely she was vexed and half angry\\nbut resolving to regulate her behaviour to him by the past\\nrather than the present she avoided every appearance\\nof resentment or displeasure and treated him as she\\nthought he ought to be treated from the family connection\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 17\\n\\n\\nmrs dashwood was surprised only for a moment at\\nseeing him for his coming to barton was in her opinion\\nof all things the most natural  her joy and expression\\nof regard long outlived her wonder  he received the kindest\\nwelcome from her and shyness coldness reserve could not\\nstand against such a reception  they had begun to fail him\\nbefore he entered the house and they were quite overcome\\nby the captivating manners of mrs dashwood  indeed a man\\ncould not very well be in love with either of her daughters\\nwithout extending the passion to her and elinor had the\\nsatisfaction of seeing him soon become more like himself\\nhis affections seemed to reanimate towards them all\\nand his interest in their welfare again became perceptible\\nhe was not in spirits however he praised their house\\nadmired its prospect was attentive and kind but still\\nhe was not in spirits  the whole family perceived it\\nand mrs dashwood attributing it to some want of liberality\\nin his mother sat down to table indignant against all\\nselfish parents\\n\\nwhat are mrs ferrarss views for you at present edward\\nsaid she when dinner was over and they had drawn round\\nthe fire are you still to be a great orator in spite of\\nyourself\\n\\nno i hope my mother is now convinced that i have\\nno more talents than inclination for a public life\\n\\nbut how is your fame to be established for famous you\\nmust be to satisfy all your family and with no inclination\\nfor expense no affection for strangers no profession\\nand no assurance you may find it a difficult matter\\n\\ni shall not attempt it  i have no wish to be\\ndistinguished and have every reason to hope i never shall\\nthank heaven i cannot be forced into genius and eloquence\\n\\nyou have no ambition i well know  your wishes\\nare all moderate\\n\\nas moderate as those of the rest of the world\\ni believe  i wish as well as every body else to be\\nperfectly happy but like every body else it must be\\nin my own way  greatness will not make me so\\n\\nstrange that it would cried marianne  what have\\nwealth or grandeur to do with happiness\\n\\ngrandeur has but little said elinor but wealth\\nhas much to do with it\\n\\nelinor for shame said marianne money can only\\ngive happiness where there is nothing else to give it\\nbeyond a competence it can afford no real satisfaction\\nas far as mere self is concerned\\n\\nperhaps said elinor smiling we may come\\nto the same point  your competence and my wealth\\nare very much alike i dare say and without them\\nas the world goes now we shall both agree that every\\nkind of external comfort must be wanting  your ideas\\nare only more noble than mine  come what is your competence\\n\\nabout eighteen hundred or two thousand a year\\nnot more than that\\n\\nelinor laughed  two thousand a year one is my\\nwealth i guessed how it would end\\n\\nand yet two thousand ayear is a very moderate income\\nsaid marianne  a family cannot well be maintained on\\na smaller  i am sure i am not extravagant in my demands\\na proper establishment of servants a carriage perhaps two\\nand hunters cannot be supported on less\\n\\nelinor smiled again to hear her sister describing\\nso accurately their future expenses at combe magna\\n\\nhunters repeated edwardbut why must you have\\nhunters  every body does not hunt\\n\\nmarianne coloured as she replied but most people do\\n\\ni wish said margaret striking out a novel thought\\nthat somebody would give us all a large fortune apiece\\n\\noh that they would cried marianne her eyes\\nsparkling with animation and her cheeks glowing\\nwith the delight of such imaginary happiness\\n\\nwe are all unanimous in that wish i suppose\\nsaid elinor in spite of the insufficiency of wealth\\n\\noh dear cried margaret how happy i should be\\ni wonder what i should do with it\\n\\nmarianne looked as if she had no doubt on that point\\n\\ni should be puzzled to spend so large a fortune myself\\nsaid mrs dashwood if my children were all to be rich\\nmy help\\n\\nyou must begin your improvements on this house\\nobserved elinor and your difficulties will soon vanish\\n\\nwhat magnificent orders would travel from this family\\nto london said edward in such an event  what a happy\\nday for booksellers musicsellers and printshops  you\\nmiss dashwood would give a general commission for every\\nnew print of merit to be sent youand as for marianne\\ni know her greatness of soul there would not be music enough\\nin london to content her  and booksthomson cowper\\nscottshe would buy them all over and over again she\\nwould buy up every copy i believe to prevent their\\nfalling into unworthy hands and she would have every\\nbook that tells her how to admire an old twisted tree\\nshould not you marianne  forgive me if i am very saucy\\nbut i was willing to shew you that i had not forgot our\\nold disputes\\n\\ni love to be reminded of the past edwardwhether it\\nbe melancholy or gay i love to recall itand you\\nwill never offend me by talking of former times\\nyou are very right in supposing how my money would be\\nspentsome of it at leastmy loose cash would certainly\\nbe employed in improving my collection of music and books\\n\\nand the bulk of your fortune would be laid out\\nin annuities on the authors or their heirs\\n\\nno edward i should have something else to do\\nwith it\\n\\nperhaps then you would bestow it as a reward on that\\nperson who wrote the ablest defence of your favourite maxim\\nthat no one can ever be in love more than once in their\\nlifeyour opinion on that point is unchanged i presume\\n\\nundoubtedly at my time of life opinions are tolerably fixed\\nit is not likely that i should now see or hear any thing to\\nchange them\\n\\nmarianne is as steadfast as ever you see said elinor\\nshe is not at all altered\\n\\nshe is only grown a little more grave than she was\\n\\nnay edward said marianne you need not reproach me\\nyou are not very gay yourself\\n\\nwhy should you think so replied he with a sigh\\nbut gaiety never was a part of my character\\n\\nnor do i think it a part of mariannes said elinor\\ni should hardly call her a lively girlshe is very earnest\\nvery eager in all she doessometimes talks a great deal\\nand always with animationbut she is not often really merry\\n\\ni believe you are right he replied and yet i\\nhave always set her down as a lively girl\\n\\ni have frequently detected myself in such kind of mistakes\\nsaid elinor in a total misapprehension of character in some\\npoint or other fancying people so much more gay or grave\\nor ingenious or stupid than they really are and i can\\nhardly tell why or in what the deception originated\\nsometimes one is guided by what they say of themselves\\nand very frequently by what other people say of them\\nwithout giving oneself time to deliberate and judge\\n\\nbut i thought it was right elinor said marianne\\nto be guided wholly by the opinion of other people\\ni thought our judgments were given us merely to be subservient\\nto those of neighbours  this has always been your doctrine\\ni am sure\\n\\nno marianne never  my doctrine has never aimed\\nat the subjection of the understanding  all i have\\never attempted to influence has been the behaviour\\nyou must not confound my meaning  i am guilty i confess\\nof having often wished you to treat our acquaintance\\nin general with greater attention but when have i advised\\nyou to adopt their sentiments or to conform to their\\njudgment in serious matters\\n\\nyou have not been able to bring your sister over to your\\nplan of general civility said edward to elinor do you gain\\nno ground\\n\\nquite the contrary replied elinor\\nlooking expressively at marianne\\n\\nmy judgment he returned is all on your side\\nof the question but i am afraid my practice is much\\nmore on your sisters  i never wish to offend but i\\nam so foolishly shy that i often seem negligent\\nwhen i am only kept back by my natural awkwardness\\ni have frequently thought that i must have been intended\\nby nature to be fond of low company i am so little at\\nmy ease among strangers of gentility\\n\\nmarianne has not shyness to excuse any inattention\\nof hers said elinor\\n\\nshe knows her own worth too well for false shame\\nreplied edward  shyness is only the effect of a sense\\nof inferiority in some way or other  if i could persuade\\nmyself that my manners were perfectly easy and graceful\\ni should not be shy\\n\\nbut you would still be reserved said marianne\\nand that is worse\\n\\nedward startedreserved am i reserved marianne\\n\\nyes very\\n\\ni do not understand you replied he colouring\\nreservedhow in what manner  what am i to tell you\\nwhat can you suppose\\n\\nelinor looked surprised at his emotion but trying\\nto laugh off the subject she said to him do not you\\nknow my sister well enough to understand what she means\\ndo not you know she calls every one reserved who does not\\ntalk as fast and admire what she admires as rapturously\\nas herself\\n\\nedward made no answer  his gravity and thoughtfulness\\nreturned on him in their fullest extentand he sat\\nfor some time silent and dull\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 18\\n\\n\\nelinor saw with great uneasiness the low spirits\\nof her friend  his visit afforded her but a very\\npartial satisfaction while his own enjoyment in it\\nappeared so imperfect  it was evident that he was unhappy\\nshe wished it were equally evident that he still\\ndistinguished her by the same affection which once\\nshe had felt no doubt of inspiring but hitherto the\\ncontinuance of his preference seemed very uncertain\\nand the reservedness of his manner towards her contradicted\\none moment what a more animated look had intimated the preceding\\none\\n\\nhe joined her and marianne in the breakfastroom\\nthe next morning before the others were down and marianne\\nwho was always eager to promote their happiness as far\\nas she could soon left them to themselves  but before she\\nwas half way upstairs she heard the parlour door open and\\nturning round was astonished to see edward himself come out\\n\\ni am going into the village to see my horses\\nsaid be as you are not yet ready for breakfast i shall\\nbe back again presently\\n\\n                    \\n\\nedward returned to them with fresh admiration\\nof the surrounding country in his walk to the village\\nhe had seen many parts of the valley to advantage\\nand the village itself in a much higher situation than\\nthe cottage afforded a general view of the whole which had\\nexceedingly pleased him  this was a subject which ensured\\nmariannes attention and she was beginning to describe\\nher own admiration of these scenes and to question him more\\nminutely on the objects that had particularly struck him\\nwhen edward interrupted her by saying you must not\\nenquire too far marianneremember i have no knowledge\\nin the picturesque and i shall offend you by my ignorance\\nand want of taste if we come to particulars  i shall call\\nhills steep which ought to be bold surfaces strange\\nand uncouth which ought to be irregular and rugged\\nand distant objects out of sight which ought only to be\\nindistinct through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere\\nyou must be satisfied with such admiration as i can\\nhonestly give  i call it a very fine countrythe\\nhills are steep the woods seem full of fine timber\\nand the valley looks comfortable and snugwith rich\\nmeadows and several neat farm houses scattered here\\nand there  it exactly answers my idea of a fine country\\nbecause it unites beauty with utilityand i dare say it\\nis a picturesque one too because you admire it i can\\neasily believe it to be full of rocks and promontories\\ngrey moss and brush wood but these are all lost on me\\ni know nothing of the picturesque\\n\\ni am afraid it is but too true said marianne\\nbut why should you boast of it\\n\\ni suspect said elinor that to avoid one kind\\nof affectation edward here falls into another  because he\\nbelieves many people pretend to more admiration of the beauties\\nof nature than they really feel and is disgusted with\\nsuch pretensions he affects greater indifference and less\\ndiscrimination in viewing them himself than he possesses\\nhe is fastidious and will have an affectation of his own\\n\\nit is very true said marianne that admiration\\nof landscape scenery is become a mere jargon\\nevery body pretends to feel and tries to describe with\\nthe taste and elegance of him who first defined what\\npicturesque beauty was  i detest jargon of every kind\\nand sometimes i have kept my feelings to myself\\nbecause i could find no language to describe them\\nin but what was worn and hackneyed out of all sense and meaning\\n\\ni am convinced said edward that you really feel\\nall the delight in a fine prospect which you profess\\nto feel  but in return your sister must allow me\\nto feel no more than i profess  i like a fine prospect\\nbut not on picturesque principles  i do not like crooked\\ntwisted blasted trees  i admire them much more if they\\nare tall straight and flourishing  i do not like ruined\\ntattered cottages  i am not fond of nettles or thistles\\nor heath blossoms  i have more pleasure in a snug\\nfarmhouse than a watchtowerand a troop of tidy\\nhappy villages please me better than the finest banditti\\nin the world\\n\\nmarianne looked with amazement at edward\\nwith compassion at her sister  elinor only laughed\\n\\nthe subject was continued no farther and marianne\\nremained thoughtfully silent till a new object suddenly\\nengaged her attention  she was sitting by edward and\\nin taking his tea from mrs dashwood his hand passed\\nso directly before her as to make a ring with a plait\\nof hair in the centre very conspicuous on one of his fingers\\n\\ni never saw you wear a ring before edward she cried\\nis that fannys hair i remember her promising to give\\nyou some  but i should have thought her hair had been darker\\n\\nmarianne spoke inconsiderately what she really felt\\nbut when she saw how much she had pained edward her own\\nvexation at her want of thought could not be surpassed\\nby his  he coloured very deeply and giving a momentary\\nglance at elinor replied yes it is my sisters hair\\nthe setting always casts a different shade on it\\nyou know\\n\\nelinor had met his eye and looked conscious likewise\\nthat the hair was her own she instantaneously felt as\\nwell satisfied as marianne the only difference in their\\nconclusions was that what marianne considered as a free\\ngift from her sister elinor was conscious must have been\\nprocured by some theft or contrivance unknown to herself\\nshe was not in a humour however to regard it as an affront\\nand affecting to take no notice of what passed\\nby instantly talking of something else she internally\\nresolved henceforward to catch every opportunity of eyeing\\nthe hair and of satisfying herself beyond all doubt\\nthat it was exactly the shade of her own\\n\\nedwards embarrassment lasted some time and it\\nended in an absence of mind still more settled\\nhe was particularly grave the whole morning\\nmarianne severely censured herself for what she had said\\nbut her own forgiveness might have been more speedy\\nhad she known how little offence it had given her sister\\n\\nbefore the middle of the day they were visited by sir\\njohn and mrs jennings who having heard of the arrival\\nof a gentleman at the cottage came to take a survey\\nof the guest  with the assistance of his motherinlaw\\nsir john was not long in discovering that the name of\\nferrars began with an f and this prepared a future mine\\nof raillery against the devoted elinor which nothing but\\nthe newness of their acquaintance with edward could have\\nprevented from being immediately sprung  but as it was\\nshe only learned from some very significant looks how far\\ntheir penetration founded on margarets instructions extended\\n\\nsir john never came to the dashwoods without either\\ninviting them to dine at the park the next day or to drink\\ntea with them that evening  on the present occasion\\nfor the better entertainment of their visitor towards\\nwhose amusement he felt himself bound to contribute\\nhe wished to engage them for both\\n\\nyou must drink tea with us to night said he\\nfor we shall be quite aloneand tomorrow you must\\nabsolutely dine with us for we shall be a large party\\n\\nmrs jennings enforced the necessity  and who knows\\nbut you may raise a dance said she  and that will\\ntempt you miss marianne\\n\\na dance cried marianne  impossible who is to dance\\n\\nwho why yourselves and the careys and whitakers\\nto be surewhat you thought nobody could dance\\nbecause a certain person that shall be nameless is gone\\n\\ni wish with all my soul cried sir john\\nthat willoughby were among us again\\n\\nthis and mariannes blushing gave new suspicions\\nto edward  and who is willoughby said he in a low voice\\nto miss dashwood by whom he was sitting\\n\\nshe gave him a brief reply  mariannes countenance\\nwas more communicative  edward saw enough to comprehend\\nnot only the meaning of others but such of mariannes\\nexpressions as had puzzled him before and when their\\nvisitors left them he went immediately round her and said\\nin a whisper i have been guessing  shall i tell you\\nmy guess\\n\\nwhat do you mean\\n\\nshall i tell you\\n\\ncertainly\\n\\nwell then i guess that mr willoughby hunts\\n\\nmarianne was surprised and confused yet she could\\nnot help smiling at the quiet archness of his manner\\nand after a moments silence said\\n\\noh edward how can youbut the time will come\\ni hopei am sure you will like him\\n\\ni do not doubt it replied he rather astonished\\nat her earnestness and warmth for had he not imagined it\\nto be a joke for the good of her acquaintance in general\\nfounded only on a something or a nothing between mr willoughby\\nand herself he would not have ventured to mention it\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 19\\n\\n\\nedward remained a week at the cottage he was earnestly\\npressed by mrs dashwood to stay longer but as if he\\nwere bent only on selfmortification he seemed resolved\\nto be gone when his enjoyment among his friends was at\\nthe height  his spirits during the last two or three days\\nthough still very unequal were greatly improvedhe grew\\nmore and more partial to the house and environsnever\\nspoke of going away without a sighdeclared his time\\nto be wholly disengagedeven doubted to what place he\\nshould go when he left thembut still go he must\\nnever had any week passed so quicklyhe could hardly\\nbelieve it to be gone  he said so repeatedly other things\\nhe said too which marked the turn of his feelings and gave\\nthe lie to his actions  he had no pleasure at norland\\nhe detested being in town but either to norland or london\\nhe must go  he valued their kindness beyond any thing\\nand his greatest happiness was in being with them\\nyet he must leave them at the end of a week in spite\\nof their wishes and his own and without any restraint\\non his time\\n\\nelinor placed all that was astonishing in this\\nway of acting to his mothers account and it was\\nhappy for her that he had a mother whose character\\nwas so imperfectly known to her as to be the general\\nexcuse for every thing strange on the part of her son\\ndisappointed however and vexed as she was and sometimes\\ndispleased with his uncertain behaviour to herself\\nshe was very well disposed on the whole to regard his actions\\nwith all the candid allowances and generous qualifications\\nwhich had been rather more painfully extorted from her\\nfor willoughbys service by her mother  his want of spirits\\nof openness and of consistency were most usually\\nattributed to his want of independence and his better\\nknowledge of mrs ferrarss disposition and designs\\nthe shortness of his visit the steadiness of his purpose\\nin leaving them originated in the same fettered inclination\\nthe same inevitable necessity of temporizing with his mother\\nthe old wellestablished grievance of duty against will\\nparent against child was the cause of all  she would have\\nbeen glad to know when these difficulties were to cease\\nthis opposition was to yieldwhen mrs ferrars would\\nbe reformed and her son be at liberty to be happy\\nbut from such vain wishes she was forced to turn for comfort\\nto the renewal of her confidence in edwards affection\\nto the remembrance of every mark of regard in look or word\\nwhich fell from him while at barton and above all\\nto that flattering proof of it which he constantly wore\\nround his finger\\n\\ni think edward said mrs dashwood as they were\\nat breakfast the last morning you would be a happier man\\nif you had any profession to engage your time and give\\nan interest to your plans and actions  some inconvenience\\nto your friends indeed might result from ityou\\nwould not be able to give them so much of your time\\nbut with a smile you would be materially benefited\\nin one particular at leastyou would know where to go\\nwhen you left them\\n\\ni do assure you he replied that i have long\\nthought on this point as you think now  it has been\\nand is and probably will always be a heavy misfortune\\nto me that i have had no necessary business to engage me\\nno profession to give me employment or afford me any\\nthing like independence  but unfortunately my own nicety\\nand the nicety of my friends have made me what i am\\nan idle helpless being  we never could agree in our\\nchoice of a profession  i always preferred the church\\nas i still do  but that was not smart enough for my family\\nthey recommended the army  that was a great deal\\ntoo smart for me  the law was allowed to be genteel\\nenough many young men who had chambers in the temple\\nmade a very good appearance in the first circles\\nand drove about town in very knowing gigs  but i had\\nno inclination for the law even in this less abstruse\\nstudy of it which my family approved  as for the navy\\nit had fashion on its side but i was too old when the\\nsubject was first started to enter itand at length\\nas there was no necessity for my having any profession\\nat all as i might be as dashing and expensive without\\na red coat on my back as with one idleness was pronounced\\non the whole to be most advantageous and honourable\\nand a young man of eighteen is not in general so earnestly\\nbent on being busy as to resist the solicitations of his\\nfriends to do nothing  i was therefore entered at oxford\\nand have been properly idle ever since\\n\\nthe consequence of which i suppose will be\\nsaid mrs dashwood since leisure has not promoted\\nyour own happiness that your sons will be brought up\\nto as many pursuits employments professions and trades\\nas columellas\\n\\nthey will be brought up said he in a serious accent\\nto be as unlike myself as is possible  in feeling\\nin action in condition in every thing\\n\\ncome come this is all an effusion of immediate\\nwant of spirits edward  you are in a melancholy humour\\nand fancy that any one unlike yourself must be happy\\nbut remember that the pain of parting from friends\\nwill be felt by every body at times whatever be their\\neducation or state  know your own happiness  you want\\nnothing but patienceor give it a more fascinating name\\ncall it hope  your mother will secure to you in time\\nthat independence you are so anxious for it is her duty\\nand it will it must ere long become her happiness to\\nprevent your whole youth from being wasted in discontent\\nhow much may not a few months do\\n\\ni think replied edward that i may defy many\\nmonths to produce any good to me\\n\\nthis desponding turn of mind though it could not\\nbe communicated to mrs dashwood gave additional pain\\nto them all in the parting which shortly took place\\nand left an uncomfortable impression on elinors\\nfeelings especially which required some trouble and time\\nto subdue  but as it was her determination to subdue it\\nand to prevent herself from appearing to suffer more than\\nwhat all her family suffered on his going away she did\\nnot adopt the method so judiciously employed by marianne\\non a similar occasion to augment and fix her sorrow\\nby seeking silence solitude and idleness  their means\\nwere as different as their objects and equally suited\\nto the advancement of each\\n\\nelinor sat down to her drawingtable as soon as he\\nwas out of the house busily employed herself the whole day\\nneither sought nor avoided the mention of his name\\nappeared to interest herself almost as much as ever in the\\ngeneral concerns of the family and if by this conduct\\nshe did not lessen her own grief it was at least prevented\\nfrom unnecessary increase and her mother and sisters\\nwere spared much solicitude on her account\\n\\nsuch behaviour as this so exactly the reverse\\nof her own appeared no more meritorious to marianne\\nthan her own had seemed faulty to her  the business\\nof selfcommand she settled very easilywith strong\\naffections it was impossible with calm ones it could\\nhave no merit  that her sisters affections were calm\\nshe dared not deny though she blushed to acknowledge it\\nand of the strength of her own she gave a very striking proof\\nby still loving and respecting that sister in spite\\nof this mortifying conviction\\n\\nwithout shutting herself up from her family\\nor leaving the house in determined solitude to avoid them\\nor lying awake the whole night to indulge meditation\\nelinor found every day afforded her leisure enough\\nto think of edward and of edwards behaviour in every\\npossible variety which the different state of her spirits\\nat different times could producewith tenderness\\npity approbation censure and doubt  there were moments\\nin abundance when if not by the absence of her mother\\nand sisters at least by the nature of their employments\\nconversation was forbidden among them and every effect\\nof solitude was produced  her mind was inevitably\\nat liberty her thoughts could not be chained elsewhere\\nand the past and the future on a subject so interesting\\nmust be before her must force her attention and engross\\nher memory her reflection and her fancy\\n\\nfrom a reverie of this kind as she sat at her\\ndrawingtable she was roused one morning soon after\\nedwards leaving them by the arrival of company\\nshe happened to be quite alone  the closing of the\\nlittle gate at the entrance of the green court in front\\nof the house drew her eyes to the window and she saw\\na large party walking up to the door  amongst them\\nwere sir john and lady middleton and mrs jennings\\nbut there were two others a gentleman and lady who were\\nquite unknown to her  she was sitting near the window\\nand as soon as sir john perceived her he left the rest\\nof the party to the ceremony of knocking at the door\\nand stepping across the turf obliged her to open the\\ncasement to speak to him though the space was so short\\nbetween the door and the window as to make it hardly\\npossible to speak at one without being heard at the other\\n\\nwell said he we have brought you some strangers\\nhow do you like them\\n\\nhush they will hear you\\n\\nnever mind if they do  it is only the palmers\\ncharlotte is very pretty i can tell you  you may see her\\nif you look this way\\n\\nas elinor was certain of seeing her in a couple\\nof minutes without taking that liberty she begged\\nto be excused\\n\\nwhere is marianne has she run away because we\\nare come i see her instrument is open\\n\\nshe is walking i believe\\n\\nthey were now joined by mrs jennings who had not\\npatience enough to wait till the door was opened before\\nshe told her story  she came hallooing to the window\\nhow do you do my dear  how does mrs dashwood do\\nand where are your sisters  what all alone you\\nwill be glad of a little company to sit with you\\ni have brought my other son and daughter to see you\\nonly think of their coming so suddenly  i thought i heard\\na carriage last night while we were drinking our tea\\nbut it never entered my head that it could be them\\ni thought of nothing but whether it might not be colonel\\nbrandon come back again so i said to sir john i do think\\ni hear a carriage perhaps it is colonel brandon come\\nback again\\n\\nelinor was obliged to turn from her in the middle\\nof her story to receive the rest of the party lady\\nmiddleton introduced the two strangers mrs dashwood\\nand margaret came down stairs at the same time and they\\nall sat down to look at one another while mrs jennings\\ncontinued her story as she walked through the passage\\ninto the parlour attended by sir john\\n\\nmrs palmer was several years younger than lady\\nmiddleton and totally unlike her in every respect\\nshe was short and plump had a very pretty face\\nand the finest expression of good humour in it that could\\npossibly be  her manners were by no means so elegant\\nas her sisters but they were much more prepossessing\\nshe came in with a smile smiled all the time of her visit\\nexcept when she laughed and smiled when she went away\\nher husband was a grave looking young man of five or six\\nand twenty with an air of more fashion and sense than\\nhis wife but of less willingness to please or be pleased\\nhe entered the room with a look of selfconsequence\\nslightly bowed to the ladies without speaking a word\\nand after briefly surveying them and their apartments\\ntook up a newspaper from the table and continued to read it\\nas long as he staid\\n\\nmrs palmer on the contrary who was strongly endowed\\nby nature with a turn for being uniformly civil and happy\\nwas hardly seated before her admiration of the parlour\\nand every thing in it burst forth\\n\\nwell what a delightful room this is i never\\nsaw anything so charming  only think mamma how it\\nis improved since i was here last i always thought it\\nsuch a sweet place maam turning to mrs dashwood\\nbut you have made it so charming  only look sister\\nhow delightful every thing is how i should like such\\na house for myself  should not you mr palmer\\n\\nmr palmer made her no answer and did not even raise\\nhis eyes from the newspaper\\n\\nmr palmer does not hear me said she laughing\\nhe never does sometimes  it is so ridiculous\\n\\nthis was quite a new idea to mrs dashwood she had\\nnever been used to find wit in the inattention of any one\\nand could not help looking with surprise at them both\\n\\nmrs jennings in the meantime talked on as loud\\nas she could and continued her account of their surprise\\nthe evening before on seeing their friends without\\nceasing till every thing was told  mrs palmer laughed\\nheartily at the recollection of their astonishment\\nand every body agreed two or three times over that it\\nhad been quite an agreeable surprise\\n\\nyou may believe how glad we all were to see them\\nadded mrs jennings leaning forward towards elinor\\nand speaking in a low voice as if she meant to be heard\\nby no one else though they were seated on different sides\\nof the room but however i cant help wishing they had\\nnot travelled quite so fast nor made such a long journey\\nof it for they came all round by london upon account\\nof some business for you know nodding significantly and\\npointing to her daughter it was wrong in her situation\\ni wanted her to stay at home and rest this morning\\nbut she would come with us she longed so much to see\\nyou all\\n\\nmrs palmer laughed and said it would not do her\\nany harm\\n\\nshe expects to be confined in february\\ncontinued mrs jennings\\n\\nlady middleton could no longer endure such a conversation\\nand therefore exerted herself to ask mr palmer if there\\nwas any news in the paper\\n\\nno none at all he replied and read on\\n\\nhere comes marianne cried sir john  now palmer\\nyou shall see a monstrous pretty girl\\n\\nhe immediately went into the passage opened the front door\\nand ushered her in himself  mrs jennings asked her\\nas soon as she appeared if she had not been to allenham\\nand mrs palmer laughed so heartily at the question\\nas to show she understood it  mr palmer looked up\\non her entering the room stared at her some minutes\\nand then returned to his newspaper  mrs palmers eye\\nwas now caught by the drawings which hung round the room\\nshe got up to examine them\\n\\noh dear how beautiful these are  well how delightful\\ndo but look mama how sweet i declare they are quite charming\\ni could look at them for ever and then sitting down again\\nshe very soon forgot that there were any such things in the room\\n\\nwhen lady middleton rose to go away mr palmer\\nrose also laid down the newspaper stretched himself\\nand looked at them all around\\n\\nmy love have you been asleep said his wife laughing\\n\\nhe made her no answer and only observed after again\\nexamining the room that it was very low pitched\\nand that the ceiling was crooked  he then made his bow\\nand departed with the rest\\n\\nsir john had been very urgent with them all to\\nspend the next day at the park  mrs dashwood who did\\nnot chuse to dine with them oftener than they dined\\nat the cottage absolutely refused on her own account\\nher daughters might do as they pleased  but they had no\\ncuriosity to see how mr and mrs palmer ate their dinner\\nand no expectation of pleasure from them in any other way\\nthey attempted therefore likewise to excuse themselves\\nthe weather was uncertain and not likely to be good\\nbut sir john would not be satisfiedthe carriage should\\nbe sent for them and they must come  lady middleton too\\nthough she did not press their mother pressed them\\nmrs jennings and mrs palmer joined their entreaties all\\nseemed equally anxious to avoid a family party and the young\\nladies were obliged to yield\\n\\nwhy should they ask us said marianne as soon as they\\nwere gone  the rent of this cottage is said to be low\\nbut we have it on very hard terms if we are to dine\\nat the park whenever any one is staying either with them\\nor with us\\n\\nthey mean no less to be civil and kind to us now\\nsaid elinor by these frequent invitations than by\\nthose which we received from them a few weeks ago\\nthe alteration is not in them if their parties are grown\\ntedious and dull  we must look for the change elsewhere\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 20\\n\\n\\nas the miss dashwoods entered the drawingroom of the park\\nthe next day at one door mrs palmer came running in at\\nthe other looking as good humoured and merry as before\\nshe took them all most affectionately by the hand\\nand expressed great delight in seeing them again\\n\\ni am so glad to see you said she seating herself\\nbetween elinor and marianne for it is so bad a day i was\\nafraid you might not come which would be a shocking thing\\nas we go away again tomorrow we must go for the westons\\ncome to us next week you know  it was quite a sudden thing\\nour coming at all and i knew nothing of it till the carriage\\nwas coming to the door and then mr palmer asked me if i\\nwould go with him to barton  he is so droll he never\\ntells me any thing i am so sorry we cannot stay longer\\nhowever we shall meet again in town very soon i hope\\n\\nthey were obliged to put an end to such an expectation\\n\\nnot go to town cried mrs palmer with a laugh\\ni shall be quite disappointed if you do not  i could\\nget the nicest house in world for you next door to ours\\nin hanoversquare  you must come indeed  i am sure\\ni shall be very happy to chaperon you at any time till\\ni am confined if mrs dashwood should not like to go\\ninto public\\n\\nthey thanked her but were obliged to resist all\\nher entreaties\\n\\noh my love cried mrs palmer to her husband\\nwho just then entered the roomyou must help me to\\npersuade the miss dashwoods to go to town this winter\\n\\nher love made no answer and after slightly bowing\\nto the ladies began complaining of the weather\\n\\nhow horrid all this is said he  such weather\\nmakes every thing and every body disgusting  dullness\\nis as much produced within doors as without by rain\\nit makes one detest all ones acquaintance  what the\\ndevil does sir john mean by not having a billiard room\\nin his house  how few people know what comfort is  sir\\njohn is as stupid as the weather\\n\\nthe rest of the company soon dropt in\\n\\ni am afraid miss marianne said sir john you have\\nnot been able to take your usual walk to allenham today\\n\\nmarianne looked very grave and said nothing\\n\\noh dont be so sly before us said mrs palmer\\nfor we know all about it i assure you and i admire your\\ntaste very much for i think he is extremely handsome\\nwe do not live a great way from him in the country you know\\nnot above ten miles i dare say\\n\\nmuch nearer thirty said her husband\\n\\nah well there is not much difference\\ni never was at his house but they say it is a sweet\\npretty place\\n\\nas vile a spot as i ever saw in my life\\nsaid mr palmer\\n\\nmarianne remained perfectly silent though her\\ncountenance betrayed her interest in what was said\\n\\nis it very ugly continued mrs palmerthen it\\nmust be some other place that is so pretty i suppose\\n\\nwhen they were seated in the dining room sir john\\nobserved with regret that they were only eight all together\\n\\nmy dear said he to his lady it is very provoking\\nthat we should be so few  why did not you ask the gilberts\\nto come to us today\\n\\ndid not i tell you sir john when you spoke to me\\nabout it before that it could not be done  they dined\\nwith us last\\n\\nyou and i sir john said mrs jennings\\nshould not stand upon such ceremony\\n\\nthen you would be very illbred cried mr palmer\\n\\nmy love you contradict every body said his wife\\nwith her usual laugh  do you know that you are quite rude\\n\\ni did not know i contradicted any body in calling\\nyour mother illbred\\n\\nay you may abuse me as you please said the goodnatured\\nold lady you have taken charlotte off my hands and cannot\\ngive her back again  so there i have the whip hand of you\\n\\ncharlotte laughed heartily to think that her\\nhusband could not get rid of her and exultingly said\\nshe did not care how cross he was to her as they must\\nlive together  it was impossible for any one to be more\\nthoroughly goodnatured or more determined to be happy\\nthan mrs palmer  the studied indifference insolence\\nand discontent of her husband gave her no pain\\nand when he scolded or abused her she was highly diverted\\n\\nmr palmer is so droll said she in a whisper\\nto elinor  he is always out of humour\\n\\nelinor was not inclined after a little observation\\nto give him credit for being so genuinely and unaffectedly\\nillnatured or illbred as he wished to appear\\nhis temper might perhaps be a little soured by finding\\nlike many others of his sex that through some unaccountable\\nbias in favour of beauty he was the husband of a very silly\\nwomanbut she knew that this kind of blunder was too\\ncommon for any sensible man to be lastingly hurt by it\\nit was rather a wish of distinction she believed\\nwhich produced his contemptuous treatment of every body\\nand his general abuse of every thing before him\\nit was the desire of appearing superior to other people\\nthe motive was too common to be wondered at but the means\\nhowever they might succeed by establishing his superiority\\nin illbreeding were not likely to attach any one to him\\nexcept his wife\\n\\noh my dear miss dashwood said mrs palmer soon afterwards\\ni have got such a favour to ask of you and your sister\\nwill you come and spend some time at cleveland this\\nchristmas  now pray doand come while the westons are\\nwith us  you cannot think how happy i shall be  it will\\nbe quite delightfulmy love applying to her husband\\ndont you long to have the miss dashwoods come to cleveland\\n\\ncertainly he replied with a sneeri came\\ninto devonshire with no other view\\n\\nthere nowsaid his lady you see mr palmer\\nexpects you so you cannot refuse to come\\n\\nthey both eagerly and resolutely declined her invitation\\n\\nbut indeed you must and shall come  i am sure you\\nwill like it of all things  the westons will be with us\\nand it will be quite delightful  you cannot think\\nwhat a sweet place cleveland is and we are so gay now\\nfor mr palmer is always going about the country canvassing\\nagainst the election and so many people came to dine\\nwith us that i never saw before it is quite charming  but\\npoor fellow it is very fatiguing to him for he is forced\\nto make every body like him\\n\\nelinor could hardly keep her countenance as she\\nassented to the hardship of such an obligation\\n\\nhow charming it will be said charlotte when he\\nis in parliamentwont it how i shall laugh  it will\\nbe so ridiculous to see all his letters directed to him\\nwith an mpbut do you know he says he will never frank\\nfor me  he declares he wont  dont you mr palmer\\n\\nmr palmer took no notice of her\\n\\nhe cannot bear writing you know she continued\\nhe says it is quite shocking\\n\\nno said he i never said any thing so irrational\\ndont palm all your abuses of languages upon me\\n\\nthere now you see how droll he is  this is always\\nthe way with him  sometimes he wont speak to me for half\\na day together and then he comes out with something\\nso drollall about any thing in the world\\n\\nshe surprised elinor very much as they returned\\ninto the drawingroom by asking her whether she did\\nnot like mr palmer excessively\\n\\ncertainly said elinor he seems very agreeable\\n\\nwelli am so glad you do  i thought you would\\nhe is so pleasant and mr palmer is excessively pleased\\nwith you and your sisters i can tell you and you cant\\nthink how disappointed he will be if you dont come\\nto clevelandi cant imagine why you should object\\nto it\\n\\nelinor was again obliged to decline her invitation\\nand by changing the subject put a stop to her entreaties\\nshe thought it probable that as they lived in the\\nsame county mrs palmer might be able to give some\\nmore particular account of willoughbys general\\ncharacter than could be gathered from the middletons\\npartial acquaintance with him and she was eager to gain\\nfrom any one such a confirmation of his merits as might\\nremove the possibility of fear from marianne  she began\\nby inquiring if they saw much of mr willoughby at cleveland\\nand whether they were intimately acquainted with him\\n\\noh dear yes i know him extremely well\\nreplied mrs palmernot that i ever spoke\\nto him indeed but i have seen him for ever in town\\nsomehow or other i never happened to be staying at barton\\nwhile he was at allenham  mama saw him here once before\\nbut i was with my uncle at weymouth  however i dare say\\nwe should have seen a great deal of him in somersetshire\\nif it had not happened very unluckily that we should never\\nhave been in the country together  he is very little\\nat combe i believe but if he were ever so much there\\ni do not think mr palmer would visit him for he is\\nin the opposition you know and besides it is such a\\nway off  i know why you inquire about him very well\\nyour sister is to marry him  i am monstrous glad of it\\nfor then i shall have her for a neighbour you know\\n\\nupon my word replied elinor you know much\\nmore of the matter than i do if you have any reason\\nto expect such a match\\n\\ndont pretend to deny it because you know it is\\nwhat every body talks of  i assure you i heard of it\\nin my way through town\\n\\nmy dear mrs palmer\\n\\nupon my honour i didi met colonel brandon\\nmonday morning in bondstreet just before we left town\\nand he told me of it directly\\n\\nyou surprise me very much  colonel brandon tell\\nyou of it  surely you must be mistaken  to give such\\nintelligence to a person who could not be interested in it\\neven if it were true is not what i should expect colonel\\nbrandon to do\\n\\nbut i do assure you it was so for all that\\nand i will tell you how it happened  when we met him\\nhe turned back and walked with us and so we began talking\\nof my brother and sister and one thing and another\\nand i said to him so colonel there is a new family\\ncome to barton cottage i hear and mama sends me word\\nthey are very pretty and that one of them is going to be\\nmarried to mr willoughby of combe magna  is it true\\npray for of course you must know as you have been in\\ndevonshire so lately\\n\\nand what did the colonel say\\n\\nohhe did not say much but he looked as if he\\nknew it to be true so from that moment i set it down\\nas certain  it will be quite delightful i declare\\nwhen is it to take place\\n\\nmr brandon was very well i hope\\n\\noh yes quite well and so full of your praises\\nhe did nothing but say fine things of you\\n\\ni am flattered by his commendation  he seems\\nan excellent man and i think him uncommonly pleasing\\n\\nso do ihe is such a charming man that it\\nis quite a pity he should be so grave and so dull\\nmamma says he was in love with your sister too\\ni assure you it was a great compliment if he was for he\\nhardly ever falls in love with any body\\n\\nis mr willoughby much known in your part\\nof somersetshire said elinor\\n\\noh yes extremely well that is i do not believe\\nmany people are acquainted with him because combe magna\\nis so far off but they all think him extremely agreeable\\ni assure you  nobody is more liked than mr willoughby\\nwherever he goes and so you may tell your sister\\nshe is a monstrous lucky girl to get him upon my honour\\nnot but that he is much more lucky in getting her\\nbecause she is so very handsome and agreeable that nothing\\ncan be good enough for her  however i dont think\\nher hardly at all handsomer than you i assure you\\nfor i think you both excessively pretty and so does\\nmr palmer too i am sure though we could not get him\\nto own it last night\\n\\nmrs palmers information respecting willoughby\\nwas not very material but any testimony in his favour\\nhowever small was pleasing to her\\n\\ni am so glad we are got acquainted at last\\ncontinued charlotteand now i hope we shall always be\\ngreat friends  you cant think how much i longed to see you\\nit is so delightful that you should live at the cottage\\nnothing can be like it to be sure  and i am so glad\\nyour sister is going to be well married  i hope you will\\nbe a great deal at combe magna  it is a sweet place\\nby all accounts\\n\\nyou have been long acquainted with colonel brandon\\nhave not you\\n\\nyes a great while ever since my sister married\\nhe was a particular friend of sir johns i believe\\nshe added in a low voice he would have been very\\nglad to have had me if he could  sir john and lady\\nmiddleton wished it very much  but mama did not think\\nthe match good enough for me otherwise sir john would\\nhave mentioned it to the colonel and we should have been\\nmarried immediately\\n\\ndid not colonel brandon know of sir johns proposal\\nto your mother before it was made  had he never owned\\nhis affection to yourself\\n\\noh no but if mama had not objected to it\\ni dare say he would have liked it of all things\\nhe had not seen me then above twice for it was before\\ni left school  however i am much happier as i am\\nmr palmer is the kind of man i like\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 21\\n\\n\\nthe palmers returned to cleveland the next day\\nand the two families at barton were again left to entertain\\neach other  but this did not last long elinor had hardly\\ngot their last visitors out of her head had hardly done\\nwondering at charlottes being so happy without a cause\\nat mr palmers acting so simply with good abilities\\nand at the strange unsuitableness which often existed between\\nhusband and wife before sir johns and mrs jenningss\\nactive zeal in the cause of society procured her some\\nother new acquaintance to see and observe\\n\\nin a mornings excursion to exeter they had met with\\ntwo young ladies whom mrs jennings had the satisfaction\\nof discovering to be her relations and this was enough\\nfor sir john to invite them directly to the park\\nas soon as their present engagements at exeter were over\\ntheir engagements at exeter instantly gave way before\\nsuch an invitation and lady middleton was thrown into\\nno little alarm on the return of sir john by hearing\\nthat she was very soon to receive a visit from two girls\\nwhom she had never seen in her life and of whose elegance\\nwhose tolerable gentility even she could have no proof\\nfor the assurances of her husband and mother on that subject\\nwent for nothing at all  their being her relations too\\nmade it so much the worse and mrs jenningss attempts\\nat consolation were therefore unfortunately founded\\nwhen she advised her daughter not to care about their being\\nso fashionable because they were all cousins and must put\\nup with one another  as it was impossible however now to\\nprevent their coming lady middleton resigned herself to the\\nidea of it with all the philosophy of a wellbred woman\\ncontenting herself with merely giving her husband a gentle\\nreprimand on the subject five or six times every day\\n\\nthe young ladies arrived their appearance was by\\nno means ungenteel or unfashionable  their dress was\\nvery smart their manners very civil they were delighted\\nwith the house and in raptures with the furniture\\nand they happened to be so doatingly fond of children\\nthat lady middletons good opinion was engaged in their\\nfavour before they had been an hour at the park\\nshe declared them to be very agreeable girls indeed\\nwhich for her ladyship was enthusiastic admiration\\nsir johns confidence in his own judgment rose with this\\nanimated praise and he set off directly for the cottage\\nto tell the miss dashwoods of the miss steeles arrival\\nand to assure them of their being the sweetest girls\\nin the world  from such commendation as this however\\nthere was not much to be learned elinor well knew\\nthat the sweetest girls in the world were to be met\\nwith in every part of england under every possible\\nvariation of form face temper and understanding\\nsir john wanted the whole family to walk to the park directly\\nand look at his guests  benevolent philanthropic man  it\\nwas painful to him even to keep a third cousin to himself\\n\\ndo come now said hepray comeyou must comei\\ndeclare you shall comeyou cant think how you will\\nlike them  lucy is monstrous pretty and so good humoured\\nand agreeable  the children are all hanging about her already\\nas if she was an old acquaintance  and they both long\\nto see you of all things for they have heard at exeter\\nthat you are the most beautiful creatures in the world\\nand i have told them it is all very true and a great\\ndeal more  you will be delighted with them i am sure\\nthey have brought the whole coach full of playthings\\nfor the children  how can you be so cross as not to come\\nwhy they are your cousins you know after a fashion\\nyou are my cousins and they are my wifes so you must\\nbe related\\n\\nbut sir john could not prevail  he could only obtain\\na promise of their calling at the park within a day or two\\nand then left them in amazement at their indifference\\nto walk home and boast anew of their attractions to the\\nmiss steeles as he had been already boasting of the miss\\nsteeles to them\\n\\nwhen their promised visit to the park and consequent\\nintroduction to these young ladies took place they found\\nin the appearance of the eldest who was nearly thirty\\nwith a very plain and not a sensible face nothing to admire\\nbut in the other who was not more than two or three\\nand twenty they acknowledged considerable beauty her\\nfeatures were pretty and she had a sharp quick eye\\nand a smartness of air which though it did not give\\nactual elegance or grace gave distinction to her person\\ntheir manners were particularly civil and elinor soon\\nallowed them credit for some kind of sense when she\\nsaw with what constant and judicious attention they\\nwere making themselves agreeable to lady middleton\\nwith her children they were in continual raptures\\nextolling their beauty courting their notice and humouring\\ntheir whims and such of their time as could be spared from\\nthe importunate demands which this politeness made on it\\nwas spent in admiration of whatever her ladyship was doing\\nif she happened to be doing any thing or in taking patterns\\nof some elegant new dress in which her appearance\\nthe day before had thrown them into unceasing delight\\nfortunately for those who pay their court through\\nsuch foibles a fond mother though in pursuit of praise\\nfor her children the most rapacious of human beings\\nis likewise the most credulous her demands are exorbitant\\nbut she will swallow any thing and the excessive\\naffection and endurance of the miss steeles towards\\nher offspring were viewed therefore by lady middleton\\nwithout the smallest surprise or distrust  she saw with\\nmaternal complacency all the impertinent encroachments\\nand mischievous tricks to which her cousins submitted\\nshe saw their sashes untied their hair pulled about\\ntheir ears their workbags searched and their knives\\nand scissors stolen away and felt no doubt of its being\\na reciprocal enjoyment  it suggested no other surprise\\nthan that elinor and marianne should sit so composedly by\\nwithout claiming a share in what was passing\\n\\njohn is in such spirits today said she on his\\ntaking miss steeless pocket handkerchief and throwing\\nit out of windowhe is full of monkey tricks\\n\\nand soon afterwards on the second boys violently\\npinching one of the same ladys fingers she fondly observed\\nhow playful william is\\n\\nand here is my sweet little annamaria she added\\ntenderly caressing a little girl of three years old\\nwho had not made a noise for the last two minutes\\nand she is always so gentle and quietnever was there\\nsuch a quiet little thing\\n\\nbut unfortunately in bestowing these embraces\\na pin in her ladyships head dress slightly scratching\\nthe childs neck produced from this pattern of gentleness\\nsuch violent screams as could hardly be outdone by any\\ncreature professedly noisy  the mothers consternation\\nwas excessive but it could not surpass the alarm of the\\nmiss steeles and every thing was done by all three\\nin so critical an emergency which affection could suggest\\nas likely to assuage the agonies of the little sufferer\\nshe was seated in her mothers lap covered with kisses\\nher wound bathed with lavenderwater by one of the\\nmiss steeles who was on her knees to attend her\\nand her mouth stuffed with sugar plums by the other\\nwith such a reward for her tears the child was too wise\\nto cease crying  she still screamed and sobbed lustily\\nkicked her two brothers for offering to touch her and all\\ntheir united soothings were ineffectual till lady middleton\\nluckily remembering that in a scene of similar distress\\nlast week some apricot marmalade had been successfully\\napplied for a bruised temple the same remedy was eagerly\\nproposed for this unfortunate scratch and a slight\\nintermission of screams in the young lady on hearing it\\ngave them reason to hope that it would not be rejected\\nshe was carried out of the room therefore in her\\nmothers arms in quest of this medicine and as the\\ntwo boys chose to follow though earnestly entreated\\nby their mother to stay behind the four young ladies\\nwere left in a quietness which the room had not known for\\nmany hours\\n\\npoor little creatures said miss steele as soon\\nas they were gone  it might have been a very sad accident\\n\\nyet i hardly know how cried marianne unless it\\nhad been under totally different circumstances\\nbut this is the usual way of heightening alarm where there\\nis nothing to be alarmed at in reality\\n\\nwhat a sweet woman lady middleton is said lucy steele\\n\\nmarianne was silent it was impossible for her to say\\nwhat she did not feel however trivial the occasion\\nand upon elinor therefore the whole task of telling lies\\nwhen politeness required it always fell  she did her\\nbest when thus called on by speaking of lady middleton\\nwith more warmth than she felt though with far less than\\nmiss lucy\\n\\nand sir john too cried the elder sister\\nwhat a charming man he is\\n\\nhere too miss dashwoods commendation being only\\nsimple and just came in without any eclat  she merely\\nobserved that he was perfectly good humoured and friendly\\n\\nand what a charming little family they have  i\\nnever saw such fine children in my lifei declare i\\nquite doat upon them already and indeed i am always\\ndistractedly fond of children\\n\\ni should guess so said elinor with a smile\\nfrom what i have witnessed this morning\\n\\ni have a notion said lucy you think the little\\nmiddletons rather too much indulged perhaps they may be the\\noutside of enough but it is so natural in lady middleton\\nand for my part i love to see children full of life\\nand spirits i cannot bear them if they are tame and quiet\\n\\ni confess replied elinor that while i am at\\nbarton park i never think of tame and quiet children\\nwith any abhorrence\\n\\na short pause succeeded this speech which was first\\nbroken by miss steele who seemed very much disposed\\nfor conversation and who now said rather abruptly\\nand how do you like devonshire miss dashwood  i suppose\\nyou were very sorry to leave sussex\\n\\nin some surprise at the familiarity of this question\\nor at least of the manner in which it was spoken\\nelinor replied that she was\\n\\nnorland is a prodigious beautiful place is not it\\nadded miss steele\\n\\nwe have heard sir john admire it excessively\\nsaid lucy who seemed to think some apology necessary\\nfor the freedom of her sister\\n\\ni think every one must admire it replied elinor\\nwho ever saw the place though it is not to be supposed\\nthat any one can estimate its beauties as we do\\n\\nand had you a great many smart beaux there  i\\nsuppose you have not so many in this part of the world\\nfor my part i think they are a vast addition always\\n\\nbut why should you think said lucy looking ashamed\\nof her sister that there are not as many genteel young\\nmen in devonshire as sussex\\n\\nnay my dear im sure i dont pretend to say that there\\nant  im sure theres a vast many smart beaux in exeter\\nbut you know how could i tell what smart beaux there\\nmight be about norland and i was only afraid the miss\\ndashwoods might find it dull at barton if they had not\\nso many as they used to have  but perhaps you young ladies\\nmay not care about the beaux and had as lief be without\\nthem as with them  for my part i think they are vastly\\nagreeable provided they dress smart and behave civil\\nbut i cant bear to see them dirty and nasty  now theres\\nmr rose at exeter a prodigious smart young man\\nquite a beau clerk to mr simpson you know and yet if you\\ndo but meet him of a morning he is not fit to be seen\\ni suppose your brother was quite a beau miss dashwood\\nbefore he married as he was so rich\\n\\nupon my word replied elinor i cannot tell you\\nfor i do not perfectly comprehend the meaning of the word\\nbut this i can say that if he ever was a beau before\\nhe married he is one still for there is not the smallest\\nalteration in him\\n\\noh dear one never thinks of married mens being\\nbeauxthey have something else to do\\n\\nlord anne cried her sister you can talk of\\nnothing but beauxyou will make miss dashwood believe you\\nthink of nothing else and then to turn the discourse\\nshe began admiring the house and the furniture\\n\\nthis specimen of the miss steeles was enough\\nthe vulgar freedom and folly of the eldest left\\nher no recommendation and as elinor was not blinded\\nby the beauty or the shrewd look of the youngest\\nto her want of real elegance and artlessness she left\\nthe house without any wish of knowing them better\\n\\nnot so the miss steelesthey came from exeter well\\nprovided with admiration for the use of sir john middleton\\nhis family and all his relations and no niggardly\\nproportion was now dealt out to his fair cousins whom they\\ndeclared to be the most beautiful elegant accomplished\\nand agreeable girls they had ever beheld and with whom\\nthey were particularly anxious to be better acquainted\\nand to be better acquainted therefore elinor soon found\\nwas their inevitable lot for as sir john was entirely\\non the side of the miss steeles their party would be\\ntoo strong for opposition and that kind of intimacy\\nmust be submitted to which consists of sitting an hour\\nor two together in the same room almost every day\\nsir john could do no more but he did not know that any\\nmore was required to be together was in his opinion\\nto be intimate and while his continual schemes for their\\nmeeting were effectual he had not a doubt of their being\\nestablished friends\\n\\nto do him justice he did every thing in his power\\nto promote their unreserve by making the miss steeles\\nacquainted with whatever he knew or supposed of his cousins\\nsituations in the most delicate particularsand elinor\\nhad not seen them more than twice before the eldest of\\nthem wished her joy on her sisters having been so lucky\\nas to make a conquest of a very smart beau since she\\ncame to barton\\n\\ntwill be a fine thing to have her married so young\\nto be sure said she and i hear he is quite a beau\\nand prodigious handsome  and i hope you may have as good\\nluck yourself soonbut perhaps you may have a friend\\nin the corner already\\n\\nelinor could not suppose that sir john would be more\\nnice in proclaiming his suspicions of her regard for edward\\nthan he had been with respect to marianne indeed it was\\nrather his favourite joke of the two as being somewhat\\nnewer and more conjectural and since edwards visit\\nthey had never dined together without his drinking to her\\nbest affections with so much significancy and so many nods\\nand winks as to excite general attention  the letter f\\nhad been likewise invariably brought forward and found\\nproductive of such countless jokes that its character\\nas the wittiest letter in the alphabet had been long\\nestablished with elinor\\n\\nthe miss steeles as she expected had now all the\\nbenefit of these jokes and in the eldest of them they\\nraised a curiosity to know the name of the gentleman\\nalluded to which though often impertinently expressed\\nwas perfectly of a piece with her general inquisitiveness\\ninto the concerns of their family  but sir john did not\\nsport long with the curiosity which he delighted to raise\\nfor he had at least as much pleasure in telling the name\\nas miss steele had in hearing it\\n\\nhis name is ferrars said he in a very audible whisper\\nbut pray do not tell it for its a great secret\\n\\nferrars repeated miss steele mr ferrars is\\nthe happy man is he what your sisterinlaws brother\\nmiss dashwood a very agreeable young man to be sure\\ni know him very well\\n\\nhow can you say so anne cried lucy who generally\\nmade an amendment to all her sisters assertions\\nthough we have seen him once or twice at my uncles it\\nis rather too much to pretend to know him very well\\n\\nelinor heard all this with attention and surprise\\nand who was this uncle  where did he live  how came\\nthey acquainted  she wished very much to have the subject\\ncontinued though she did not chuse to join in it herself\\nbut nothing more of it was said and for the first time\\nin her life she thought mrs jennings deficient either\\nin curiosity after petty information or in a disposition\\nto communicate it  the manner in which miss steele had\\nspoken of edward increased her curiosity for it struck\\nher as being rather illnatured and suggested the suspicion\\nof that ladys knowing or fancying herself to know something\\nto his disadvantagebut her curiosity was unavailing\\nfor no farther notice was taken of mr ferrarss name by\\nmiss steele when alluded to or even openly mentioned by sir\\njohn\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 22\\n\\n\\nmarianne who had never much toleration for any\\nthing like impertinence vulgarity inferiority of parts\\nor even difference of taste from herself was at\\nthis time particularly illdisposed from the state\\nof her spirits to be pleased with the miss steeles\\nor to encourage their advances and to the invariable\\ncoldness of her behaviour towards them which checked every\\nendeavour at intimacy on their side elinor principally\\nattributed that preference of herself which soon became\\nevident in the manners of both but especially of lucy\\nwho missed no opportunity of engaging her in conversation\\nor of striving to improve their acquaintance by an easy\\nand frank communication of her sentiments\\n\\nlucy was naturally clever her remarks were often\\njust and amusing and as a companion for half an hour\\nelinor frequently found her agreeable but her powers\\nhad received no aid from education she was ignorant\\nand illiterate and her deficiency of all mental improvement\\nher want of information in the most common particulars\\ncould not be concealed from miss dashwood in spite of her\\nconstant endeavour to appear to advantage  elinor saw\\nand pitied her for the neglect of abilities which education\\nmight have rendered so respectable but she saw with less\\ntenderness of feeling the thorough want of delicacy\\nof rectitude and integrity of mind which her attentions\\nher assiduities her flatteries at the park betrayed\\nand she could have no lasting satisfaction in the company\\nof a person who joined insincerity with ignorance\\nwhose want of instruction prevented their meeting\\nin conversation on terms of equality and whose conduct\\ntoward others made every shew of attention and deference\\ntowards herself perfectly valueless\\n\\nyou will think my question an odd one i dare say\\nsaid lucy to her one day as they were walking together\\nfrom the park to the cottagebut pray are you\\npersonally acquainted with your sisterinlaws mother\\nmrs ferrars\\n\\nelinor did think the question a very odd one\\nand her countenance expressed it as she answered that she\\nhad never seen mrs ferrars\\n\\nindeed replied lucy i wonder at that for i\\nthought you must have seen her at norland sometimes\\nthen perhaps you cannot tell me what sort of a woman\\nshe is\\n\\nno returned elinor cautious of giving her real\\nopinion of edwards mother and not very desirous\\nof satisfying what seemed impertinent curiosity\\ni know nothing of her\\n\\ni am sure you think me very strange for enquiring\\nabout her in such a way said lucy eyeing elinor attentively\\nas she spoke but perhaps there may be reasonsi wish\\ni might venture but however i hope you will do me the justice\\nof believing that i do not mean to be impertinent\\n\\nelinor made her a civil reply and they walked on\\nfor a few minutes in silence  it was broken by lucy\\nwho renewed the subject again by saying with some\\nhesitation\\n\\ni cannot bear to have you think me impertinently curious\\ni am sure i would rather do any thing in the world than be\\nthought so by a person whose good opinion is so well worth\\nhaving as yours  and i am sure i should not have the smallest\\nfear of trusting you indeed i should be very glad of your\\nadvice how to manage in such and uncomfortable situation\\nas i am but however there is no occasion to trouble you\\ni am sorry you do not happen to know mrs ferrars\\n\\ni am sorry i do not said elinor in great astonishment\\nif it could be of any use to you to know my opinion of her\\nbut really i never understood that you were at all connected\\nwith that family and therefore i am a little surprised\\ni confess at so serious an inquiry into her character\\n\\ni dare say you are and i am sure i do not at all\\nwonder at it  but if i dared tell you all you would not be\\nso much surprised  mrs ferrars is certainly nothing to me\\nat presentbut the time may comehow soon it will come\\nmust depend upon herselfwhen we may be very intimately\\nconnected\\n\\nshe looked down as she said this amiably bashful\\nwith only one side glance at her companion to observe its\\neffect on her\\n\\ngood heavens cried elinor what do you mean\\nare you acquainted with mr robert ferrars  can you be\\nand she did not feel much delighted with the idea of such\\na sisterinlaw\\n\\nno replied lucy not to mr robert ferrarsi\\nnever saw him in my life but fixing her eyes upon elinor\\nto his eldest brother\\n\\nwhat felt elinor at that moment astonishment\\nthat would have been as painful as it was strong had not\\nan immediate disbelief of the assertion attended it\\nshe turned towards lucy in silent amazement unable to divine\\nthe reason or object of such a declaration and though\\nher complexion varied she stood firm in incredulity\\nand felt in no danger of an hysterical fit or a swoon\\n\\nyou may well be surprised continued lucy\\nfor to be sure you could have had no idea of it before\\nfor i dare say he never dropped the smallest hint of it\\nto you or any of your family because it was always meant\\nto be a great secret and i am sure has been faithfully\\nkept so by me to this hour  not a soul of all my relations\\nknow of it but anne and i never should have mentioned\\nit to you if i had not felt the greatest dependence\\nin the world upon your secrecy and i really thought my\\nbehaviour in asking so many questions about mrs ferrars\\nmust seem so odd that it ought to be explained\\nand i do not think mr ferrars can be displeased\\nwhen he knows i have trusted you because i know he has\\nthe highest opinion in the world of all your family\\nand looks upon yourself and the other miss dashwoods quite\\nas his own sistersshe paused\\n\\nelinor for a few moments remained silent\\nher astonishment at what she heard was at first too\\ngreat for words but at length forcing herself to speak\\nand to speak cautiously she said with calmness of manner\\nwhich tolerably well concealed her surprise and solicitude\\nmay i ask if your engagement is of long standing\\n\\nwe have been engaged these four years\\n\\nfour years\\n\\nyes\\n\\nelinor though greatly shocked still felt unable\\nto believe it\\n\\ni did not know said she that you were even\\nacquainted till the other day\\n\\nour acquaintance however is of many years date\\nhe was under my uncles care you know a considerable while\\n\\nyour uncle\\n\\nyes mr pratt  did you never hear him talk\\nof mr pratt\\n\\ni think i have replied elinor with an exertion\\nof spirits which increased with her increase of emotion\\n\\nhe was four years with my uncle who lives at longstaple\\nnear plymouth  it was there our acquaintance begun\\nfor my sister and me was often staying with my uncle\\nand it was there our engagement was formed though not till\\na year after he had quitted as a pupil but he was almost\\nalways with us afterwards  i was very unwilling to enter\\ninto it as you may imagine without the knowledge and\\napprobation of his mother but i was too young and loved\\nhim too well to be so prudent as i ought to have been\\nthough you do not know him so well as me miss dashwood\\nyou must have seen enough of him to be sensible he is\\nvery capable of making a woman sincerely attached to him\\n\\ncertainly answered elinor without knowing what\\nshe said but after a moments reflection she added\\nwith revived security of edwards honour and love\\nand her companions falsehoodengaged to mr edward\\nferrarsi confess myself so totally surprised at\\nwhat you tell me that reallyi beg your pardon\\nbut surely there must be some mistake of person or name\\nwe cannot mean the same mr ferrars\\n\\nwe can mean no other cried lucy smiling  mr edward\\nferrars the eldest son of mrs ferrars of park street\\nand brother of your sisterinlaw mrs john dashwood\\nis the person i mean you must allow that i am not likely\\nto be deceived as to the name of the man on who all my happiness\\ndepends\\n\\nit is strange replied elinor in a most painful perplexity\\nthat i should never have heard him even mention your name\\n\\nno considering our situation it was not strange\\nour first care has been to keep the matter secret\\nyou knew nothing of me or my family and therefore\\nthere could be no occasion for ever mentioning my name\\nto you and as he was always particularly afraid of his\\nsisters suspecting any thing that was reason enough\\nfor his not mentioning it\\n\\nshe was silentelinors security sunk but her\\nselfcommand did not sink with it\\n\\nfour years you have been engaged said she\\nwith a firm voice\\n\\nyes and heaven knows how much longer we may have\\nto wait  poor edward  it puts him quite out of heart\\nthen taking a small miniature from her pocket she added\\nto prevent the possibility of mistake be so good as to look\\nat this face  it does not do him justice to be sure\\nbut yet i think you cannot be deceived as to the person\\nit was drew fori have had it above these three years\\n\\nshe put it into her hands as she spoke and when elinor\\nsaw the painting whatever other doubts her fear of a\\ntoo hasty decision or her wish of detecting falsehood\\nmight suffer to linger in her mind she could have none of\\nits being edwards face  she returned it almost instantly\\nacknowledging the likeness\\n\\ni have never been able continued lucy to give\\nhim my picture in return which i am very much vexed at\\nfor he has been always so anxious to get it  but i am\\ndetermined to set for it the very first opportunity\\n\\nyou are quite in the right replied elinor calmly\\nthey then proceeded a few paces in silence  lucy spoke first\\n\\ni am sure said she i have no doubt in the world\\nof your faithfully keeping this secret because you must\\nknow of what importance it is to us not to have it reach\\nhis mother for she would never approve of it i dare say\\ni shall have no fortune and i fancy she is an exceeding\\nproud woman\\n\\ni certainly did not seek your confidence said elinor\\nbut you do me no more than justice in imagining that i\\nmay be depended on  your secret is safe with me\\nbut pardon me if i express some surprise at so unnecessary\\na communication  you must at least have felt that my\\nbeing acquainted with it could not add to its safety\\n\\nas she said this she looked earnestly at lucy\\nhoping to discover something in her countenance perhaps the\\nfalsehood of the greatest part of what she had been saying\\nbut lucys countenance suffered no change\\n\\ni was afraid you would think i was taking a great\\nliberty with you said she in telling you all this\\ni have not known you long to be sure personally at least\\nbut i have known you and all your family by description\\na great while and as soon as i saw you i felt almost as if\\nyou was an old acquaintance  besides in the present case\\ni really thought some explanation was due to you after my\\nmaking such particular inquiries about edwards mother\\nand i am so unfortunate that i have not a creature whose\\nadvice i can ask  anne is the only person that knows of it\\nand she has no judgment at all indeed she does me a great\\ndeal more harm than good for i am in constant fear of her\\nbetraying me  she does not know how to hold her tongue\\nas you must perceive and i am sure i was in the greatest\\nfright in the world tother day when edwards name was\\nmentioned by sir john lest she should out with it all\\nyou cant think how much i go through in my mind from\\nit altogether  i only wonder that i am alive after what\\ni have suffered for edwards sake these last four years\\nevery thing in such suspense and uncertainty and seeing\\nhim so seldomwe can hardly meet above twice ayear\\ni am sure i wonder my heart is not quite broke\\n\\nhere she took out her handkerchief but elinor did\\nnot feel very compassionate\\n\\nsometimes continued lucy after wiping her eyes\\ni think whether it would not be better for us both\\nto break off the matter entirely  as she said this\\nshe looked directly at her companion  but then\\nat other times i have not resolution enough for it\\ni cannot bear the thoughts of making him so miserable\\nas i know the very mention of such a thing would do\\nand on my own account tooso dear as he is to mei dont\\nthink i could be equal to it  what would you advise\\nme to do in such a case miss dashwood  what would you\\ndo yourself\\n\\npardon me replied elinor startled by the question\\nbut i can give you no advice under such circumstances\\nyour own judgment must direct you\\n\\nto be sure continued lucy after a few minutes\\nsilence on both sides his mother must provide for him\\nsometime or other but poor edward is so cast down by it\\ndid you not think him dreadful lowspirited when he was at\\nbarton  he was so miserable when he left us at longstaple\\nto go to you that i was afraid you would think him quite ill\\n\\ndid he come from your uncles then when he visited us\\n\\noh yes he had been staying a fortnight with us\\ndid you think he came directly from town\\n\\nno replied elinor most feelingly sensible of\\nevery fresh circumstance in favour of lucys veracity\\ni remember he told us that he had been staying\\na fortnight with some friends near plymouth\\nshe remembered too her own surprise at the time\\nat his mentioning nothing farther of those friends\\nat his total silence with respect even to their names\\n\\ndid not you think him sadly out of spirits\\nrepeated lucy\\n\\nwe did indeed particularly so when he first arrived\\n\\ni begged him to exert himself for fear you\\nshould suspect what was the matter but it made him\\nso melancholy not being able to stay more than a\\nfortnight with us and seeing me so much affected\\npoor fellowi am afraid it is just the same with him now\\nfor he writes in wretched spirits  i heard from him just\\nbefore i left exeter taking a letter from her pocket\\nand carelessly showing the direction to elinor\\nyou know his hand i dare say a charming one it is\\nbut that is not written so well as usualhe was tired\\ni dare say for he had just filled the sheet to me as full\\nas possible\\n\\nelinor saw that it was his hand and she could doubt\\nno longer  this picture she had allowed herself to believe\\nmight have been accidentally obtained it might not have\\nbeen edwards gift but a correspondence between them\\nby letter could subsist only under a positive engagement\\ncould be authorised by nothing else for a few moments she\\nwas almost overcomeher heart sunk within her and she could\\nhardly stand but exertion was indispensably necessary\\nand she struggled so resolutely against the oppression\\nof her feelings that her success was speedy and for\\nthe time complete\\n\\nwriting to each other said lucy returning the\\nletter into her pocket is the only comfort we have\\nin such long separations  yes i have one other comfort\\nin his picture but poor edward has not even that\\nif he had but my picture he says he should be easy\\ni gave him a lock of my hair set in a ring when he was at\\nlongstaple last and that was some comfort to him he said\\nbut not equal to a picture  perhaps you might notice\\nthe ring when you saw him\\n\\ni did said elinor with a composure of voice\\nunder which was concealed an emotion and distress beyond\\nany thing she had ever felt before  she was mortified\\nshocked confounded\\n\\nfortunately for her they had now reached the cottage\\nand the conversation could be continued no farther\\nafter sitting with them a few minutes the miss steeles\\nreturned to the park and elinor was then at liberty\\nto think and be wretched\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nat this point in the first and second editions volume 1 ends\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 23\\n\\n\\nhowever small elinors general dependence on\\nlucys veracity might be it was impossible for her\\non serious reflection to suspect it in the present case\\nwhere no temptation could be answerable to the folly\\nof inventing a falsehood of such a description  what lucy\\nhad asserted to be true therefore elinor could not\\ndared not longer doubt supported as it was too on every\\nside by such probabilities and proofs and contradicted\\nby nothing but her own wishes  their opportunity of\\nacquaintance in the house of mr pratt was a foundation\\nfor the rest at once indisputable and alarming and edwards\\nvisit near plymouth his melancholy state of mind\\nhis dissatisfaction at his own prospects his uncertain\\nbehaviour towards herself the intimate knowledge of the\\nmiss steeles as to norland and their family connections\\nwhich had often surprised her the picture the letter\\nthe ring formed altogether such a body of evidence\\nas overcame every fear of condemning him unfairly\\nand established as a fact which no partiality could\\nset aside his illtreatment of herselfher resentment\\nof such behaviour her indignation at having been its dupe\\nfor a short time made her feel only for herself\\nbut other ideas other considerations soon arose\\nhad edward been intentionally deceiving her  had he feigned\\na regard for her which he did not feel  was his engagement\\nto lucy an engagement of the heart  no whatever it might\\nonce have been she could not believe it such at present\\nhis affection was all her own  she could not be deceived\\nin that  her mother sisters fanny all had been\\nconscious of his regard for her at norland it was not\\nan illusion of her own vanity  he certainly loved her\\nwhat a softener of the heart was this persuasion  how much\\ncould it not tempt her to forgive  he had been blamable\\nhighly blamable in remaining at norland after he first\\nfelt her influence over him to be more than it ought\\nto be  in that he could not be defended but if he\\nhad injured her how much more had he injured himself\\nif her case were pitiable his was hopeless\\nhis imprudence had made her miserable for a while but it\\nseemed to have deprived himself of all chance of ever\\nbeing otherwise  she might in time regain tranquillity\\nbut he what had he to look forward to  could he\\never be tolerably happy with lucy steele could he\\nwere his affection for herself out of the question\\nwith his integrity his delicacy and wellinformed mind\\nbe satisfied with a wife like herilliterate artful\\nand selfish\\n\\nthe youthful infatuation of nineteen would naturally\\nblind him to every thing but her beauty and good nature\\nbut the four succeeding yearsyears which if rationally\\nspent give such improvement to the understanding must\\nhave opened his eyes to her defects of education\\nwhile the same period of time spent on her side\\nin inferior society and more frivolous pursuits\\nhad perhaps robbed her of that simplicity which might\\nonce have given an interesting character to her beauty\\n\\nif in the supposition of his seeking to marry herself\\nhis difficulties from his mother had seemed great\\nhow much greater were they now likely to be when\\nthe object of his engagement was undoubtedly inferior\\nin connections and probably inferior in fortune to herself\\nthese difficulties indeed with a heart so alienated\\nfrom lucy might not press very hard upon his patience\\nbut melancholy was the state of the person by whom the\\nexpectation of family opposition and unkindness could\\nbe felt as a relief\\n\\nas these considerations occurred to her in painful\\nsuccession she wept for him more than for herself\\nsupported by the conviction of having done nothing to\\nmerit her present unhappiness and consoled by the belief\\nthat edward had done nothing to forfeit her esteem\\nshe thought she could even now under the first smart\\nof the heavy blow command herself enough to guard every\\nsuspicion of the truth from her mother and sisters\\nand so well was she able to answer her own expectations\\nthat when she joined them at dinner only two hours\\nafter she had first suffered the extinction of all her\\ndearest hopes no one would have supposed from the\\nappearance of the sisters that elinor was mourning\\nin secret over obstacles which must divide her for ever\\nfrom the object of her love and that marianne was\\ninternally dwelling on the perfections of a man of whose\\nwhole heart she felt thoroughly possessed and whom she\\nexpected to see in every carriage which drove near their house\\n\\nthe necessity of concealing from her mother and\\nmarianne what had been entrusted in confidence to herself\\nthough it obliged her to unceasing exertion was no\\naggravation of elinors distress  on the contrary\\nit was a relief to her to be spared the communication\\nof what would give such affliction to them and to be\\nsaved likewise from hearing that condemnation of edward\\nwhich would probably flow from the excess of their partial\\naffection for herself and which was more than she felt\\nequal to support\\n\\nfrom their counsel or their conversation she knew\\nshe could receive no assistance their tenderness and\\nsorrow must add to her distress while her selfcommand\\nwould neither receive encouragement from their example\\nnor from their praise  she was stronger alone\\nand her own good sense so well supported her that her\\nfirmness was as unshaken her appearance of cheerfulness\\nas invariable as with regrets so poignant and so fresh\\nit was possible for them to be\\n\\nmuch as she had suffered from her first conversation\\nwith lucy on the subject she soon felt an earnest wish\\nof renewing it and this for more reasons than one\\nshe wanted to hear many particulars of their engagement\\nrepeated again she wanted more clearly to understand\\nwhat lucy really felt for edward whether there were any\\nsincerity in her declaration of tender regard for him\\nand she particularly wanted to convince lucy by her\\nreadiness to enter on the matter again and her calmness\\nin conversing on it that she was no otherwise interested\\nin it than as a friend which she very much feared\\nher involuntary agitation in their morning discourse\\nmust have left at least doubtful  that lucy was disposed\\nto be jealous of her appeared very probable it was plain\\nthat edward had always spoken highly in her praise\\nnot merely from lucys assertion but from her venturing\\nto trust her on so short a personal acquaintance\\nwith a secret so confessedly and evidently important\\nand even sir johns joking intelligence must have had\\nsome weight  but indeed while elinor remained so well\\nassured within herself of being really beloved by edward\\nit required no other consideration of probabilities\\nto make it natural that lucy should be jealous\\nand that she was so her very confidence was a proof\\nwhat other reason for the disclosure of the affair could\\nthere be but that elinor might be informed by it of lucys\\nsuperior claims on edward and be taught to avoid him\\nin future  she had little difficulty in understanding thus\\nmuch of her rivals intentions and while she was firmly\\nresolved to act by her as every principle of honour and\\nhonesty directed to combat her own affection for edward\\nand to see him as little as possible she could not deny\\nherself the comfort of endeavouring to convince lucy\\nthat her heart was unwounded  and as she could now have\\nnothing more painful to hear on the subject than had already\\nbeen told she did not mistrust her own ability of going\\nthrough a repetition of particulars with composure\\n\\nbut it was not immediately that an opportunity\\nof doing so could be commanded though lucy was as well\\ndisposed as herself to take advantage of any that occurred\\nfor the weather was not often fine enough to allow\\nof their joining in a walk where they might most easily\\nseparate themselves from the others and though they\\nmet at least every other evening either at the park\\nor cottage and chiefly at the former they could\\nnot be supposed to meet for the sake of conversation\\nsuch a thought would never enter either sir john or lady\\nmiddletons head and therefore very little leisure\\nwas ever given for a general chat and none at all for\\nparticular discourse  they met for the sake of eating\\ndrinking and laughing together playing at cards\\nor consequences or any other game that was sufficiently noisy\\n\\none or two meetings of this kind had taken place\\nwithout affording elinor any chance of engaging lucy\\nin private when sir john called at the cottage one morning\\nto beg in the name of charity that they would all\\ndine with lady middleton that day as he was obliged\\nto attend the club at exeter and she would otherwise be\\nquite alone except her mother and the two miss steeles\\nelinor who foresaw a fairer opening for the point she\\nhad in view in such a party as this was likely to be\\nmore at liberty among themselves under the tranquil\\nand wellbred direction of lady middleton than when\\nher husband united them together in one noisy purpose\\nimmediately accepted the invitation margaret with her\\nmothers permission was equally compliant and marianne\\nthough always unwilling to join any of their parties\\nwas persuaded by her mother who could not bear to have her\\nseclude herself from any chance of amusement to go likewise\\n\\nthe young ladies went and lady middleton was happily\\npreserved from the frightful solitude which had threatened her\\nthe insipidity of the meeting was exactly such as elinor\\nhad expected it produced not one novelty of thought\\nor expression and nothing could be less interesting\\nthan the whole of their discourse both in the dining\\nparlour and drawing room to the latter the children\\naccompanied them and while they remained there she was\\ntoo well convinced of the impossibility of engaging lucys\\nattention to attempt it  they quitted it only with the\\nremoval of the teathings  the cardtable was then placed\\nand elinor began to wonder at herself for having ever\\nentertained a hope of finding time for conversation\\nat the park  they all rose up in preparation for a round game\\n\\ni am glad said lady middleton to lucy\\nyou are not going to finish poor little annamarias\\nbasket this evening for i am sure it must hurt your\\neyes to work filigree by candlelight  and we will make\\nthe dear little love some amends for her disappointment\\ntomorrow and then i hope she will not much mind it\\n\\nthis hint was enough lucy recollected herself instantly\\nand replied indeed you are very much mistaken\\nlady middleton i am only waiting to know whether you can\\nmake your party without me or i should have been at my\\nfiligree already  i would not disappoint the little angel\\nfor all the world and if you want me at the cardtable now\\ni am resolved to finish the basket after supper\\n\\nyou are very good i hope it wont hurt your eyes\\nwill you ring the bell for some working candles\\nmy poor little girl would be sadly disappointed i know\\nif the basket was not finished tomorrow for though i\\ntold her it certainly would not i am sure she depends\\nupon having it done\\n\\nlucy directly drew her work table near her\\nand reseated herself with an alacrity and cheerfulness\\nwhich seemed to infer that she could taste no greater\\ndelight than in making a filigree basket for a spoilt child\\n\\nlady middleton proposed a rubber of casino to the others\\nno one made any objection but marianne who with her usual\\ninattention to the forms of general civility exclaimed\\nyour ladyship will have the goodness to excuse meyou\\nknow i detest cards  i shall go to the pianoforte\\ni have not touched it since it was tuned  and without\\nfarther ceremony she turned away and walked to the instrument\\n\\nlady middleton looked as if she thanked heaven\\nthat she had never made so rude a speech\\n\\nmarianne can never keep long from that instrument\\nyou know maam said elinor endeavouring to smooth\\naway the offence and i do not much wonder at it for it\\nis the very best toned pianoforte i ever heard\\n\\nthe remaining five were now to draw their cards\\n\\nperhaps continued elinor if i should happen\\nto cut out i may be of some use to miss lucy steele\\nin rolling her papers for her and there is so much still\\nto be done to the basket that it must be impossible\\ni think for her labour singly to finish it this evening\\ni should like the work exceedingly if she would allow\\nme a share in it\\n\\nindeed i shall be very much obliged to you\\nfor your help cried lucy for i find there is more\\nto be done to it than i thought there was and it would\\nbe a shocking thing to disappoint dear annamaria after all\\n\\noh that would be terrible indeed said miss steele\\ndear little soul how i do love her\\n\\nyou are very kind said lady middleton to elinor\\nand as you really like the work perhaps you will be\\nas well pleased not to cut in till another rubber\\nor will you take your chance now\\n\\nelinor joyfully profited by the first of these proposals\\nand thus by a little of that address which marianne\\ncould never condescend to practise gained her own end\\nand pleased lady middleton at the same time  lucy made room\\nfor her with ready attention and the two fair rivals were\\nthus seated side by side at the same table and with the\\nutmost harmony engaged in forwarding the same work\\nthe pianoforte at which marianne wrapped up in her own\\nmusic and her own thoughts had by this time forgotten\\nthat any body was in the room besides herself was luckily\\nso near them that miss dashwood now judged she might safely\\nunder the shelter of its noise introduce the interesting\\nsubject without any risk of being heard at the cardtable\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 24\\n\\n\\nin a firm though cautious tone elinor thus began\\n\\ni should be undeserving of the confidence you have\\nhonoured me with if i felt no desire for its continuance\\nor no farther curiosity on its subject  i will\\nnot apologize therefore for bringing it forward again\\n\\nthank you cried lucy warmly for breaking\\nthe ice you have set my heart at ease by it for i was\\nsomehow or other afraid i had offended you by what i\\ntold you that monday\\n\\noffended me how could you suppose so believe me\\nand elinor spoke it with the truest sincerity\\nnothing could be farther from my intention than to give\\nyou such an idea  could you have a motive for the trust\\nthat was not honourable and flattering to me\\n\\nand yet i do assure you replied lucy her little\\nsharp eyes full of meaning there seemed to me to be\\na coldness and displeasure in your manner that made me\\nquite uncomfortable  i felt sure that you was angry with me\\nand have been quarrelling with myself ever since for having\\ntook such a liberty as to trouble you with my affairs\\nbut i am very glad to find it was only my own fancy\\nand that you really do not blame me  if you knew what a\\nconsolation it was to me to relieve my heart speaking to you\\nof what i am always thinking of every moment of my life\\nyour compassion would make you overlook every thing else\\ni am sure\\n\\nindeed i can easily believe that it was a very great\\nrelief to you to acknowledge your situation to me and be\\nassured that you shall never have reason to repent it\\nyour case is a very unfortunate one you seem to me to\\nbe surrounded with difficulties and you will have need\\nof all your mutual affection to support you under them\\nmr ferrars i believe is entirely dependent on his mother\\n\\nhe has only two thousand pounds of his own it would\\nbe madness to marry upon that though for my own part\\ni could give up every prospect of more without a sigh\\ni have been always used to a very small income and could\\nstruggle with any poverty for him but i love him too well\\nto be the selfish means of robbing him perhaps of all that\\nhis mother might give him if he married to please her\\nwe must wait it may be for many years  with almost every\\nother man in the world it would be an alarming prospect\\nbut edwards affection and constancy nothing can deprive me of\\ni know\\n\\nthat conviction must be every thing to you\\nand he is undoubtedly supported by the same trust in yours\\nif the strength of your reciprocal attachment had failed\\nas between many people and under many circumstances\\nit naturally would during a four years engagement\\nyour situation would have been pitiable indeed\\n\\nlucy here looked up but elinor was careful\\nin guarding her countenance from every expression\\nthat could give her words a suspicious tendency\\n\\nedwards love for me said lucy has been pretty\\nwell put to the test by our long very long absence\\nsince we were first engaged and it has stood the trial\\nso well that i should be unpardonable to doubt it now\\ni can safely say that he has never gave me one moments\\nalarm on that account from the first\\n\\nelinor hardly knew whether to smile or sigh\\nat this assertion\\n\\nlucy went on  i am rather of a jealous temper too\\nby nature and from our different situations in life\\nfrom his being so much more in the world than me and our\\ncontinual separation i was enough inclined for suspicion\\nto have found out the truth in an instant if there had been\\nthe slightest alteration in his behaviour to me when we met\\nor any lowness of spirits that i could not account for\\nor if he had talked more of one lady than another\\nor seemed in any respect less happy at longstaple than he\\nused to be  i do not mean to say that i am particularly\\nobservant or quicksighted in general but in such a case\\ni am sure i could not be deceived\\n\\nall this thought elinor is very pretty\\nbut it can impose upon neither of us\\n\\nbut what said she after a short silence\\nare your views or have you none but that of waiting for\\nmrs ferrarss death which is a melancholy and shocking\\nextremityis her son determined to submit to this\\nand to all the tediousness of the many years of suspense\\nin which it may involve you rather than run the risk\\nof her displeasure for a while by owning the truth\\n\\nif we could be certain that it would be only\\nfor a while  but mrs ferrars is a very headstrong\\nproud woman and in her first fit of anger upon hearing\\nit would very likely secure every thing to robert\\nand the idea of that for edwards sake frightens away\\nall my inclination for hasty measures\\n\\nand for your own sake too or you are carrying\\nyour disinterestedness beyond reason\\n\\nlucy looked at elinor again and was silent\\n\\ndo you know mr robert ferrars asked elinor\\n\\nnot at alli never saw him but i fancy he\\nis very unlike his brothersilly and a great coxcomb\\n\\na great coxcomb repeated miss steele whose ear had\\ncaught those words by a sudden pause in mariannes music\\noh they are talking of their favourite beaux i dare say\\n\\nno sister cried lucy you are mistaken there our\\nfavourite beaux are not great coxcombs\\n\\ni can answer for it that miss dashwoods is not\\nsaid mrs jennings laughing heartily for he is one\\nof the modestest prettiest behaved young men i ever saw\\nbut as for lucy she is such a sly little creature\\nthere is no finding out who she likes\\n\\noh cried miss steele looking significantly round\\nat them i dare say lucys beau is quite as modest\\nand pretty behaved as miss dashwoods\\n\\nelinor blushed in spite of herself  lucy bit her lip\\nand looked angrily at her sister  a mutual silence took\\nplace for some time  lucy first put an end to it by saying\\nin a lower tone though marianne was then giving them\\nthe powerful protection of a very magnificent concerto\\n\\ni will honestly tell you of one scheme which has\\nlately come into my head for bringing matters to bear\\nindeed i am bound to let you into the secret for you\\nare a party concerned  i dare say you have seen enough\\nof edward to know that he would prefer the church to every\\nother profession now my plan is that he should take\\norders as soon as he can and then through your interest\\nwhich i am sure you would be kind enough to use out of\\nfriendship for him and i hope out of some regard to me\\nyour brother might be persuaded to give him norland living\\nwhich i understand is a very good one and the present\\nincumbent not likely to live a great while  that would\\nbe enough for us to marry upon and we might trust to time\\nand chance for the rest\\n\\ni should always be happy replied elinor to show\\nany mark of my esteem and friendship for mr ferrars\\nbut do you not perceive that my interest on such an\\noccasion would be perfectly unnecessary  he is brother\\nto mrs john dashwoodthat must be recommendation enough\\nto her husband\\n\\nbut mrs john dashwood would not much approve\\nof edwards going into orders\\n\\nthen i rather suspect that my interest would\\ndo very little\\n\\nthey were again silent for many minutes  at length\\nlucy exclaimed with a deep sigh\\n\\ni believe it would be the wisest way to put an end\\nto the business at once by dissolving the engagement\\nwe seem so beset with difficulties on every side\\nthat though it would make us miserable for a time\\nwe should be happier perhaps in the end  but you will\\nnot give me your advice miss dashwood\\n\\nno answered elinor with a smile which concealed\\nvery agitated feelings on such a subject i certainly\\nwill not  you know very well that my opinion would have\\nno weight with you unless it were on the side of your wishes\\n\\nindeed you wrong me replied lucy with great\\nsolemnity i know nobody of whose judgment i think\\nso highly as i do of yours and i do really believe\\nthat if you was to say to me i advise you by all means\\nto put an end to your engagement with edward ferrars\\nit will be more for the happiness of both of you\\ni should resolve upon doing it immediately\\n\\nelinor blushed for the insincerity of edwards\\nfuture wife and replied this compliment would effectually\\nfrighten me from giving any opinion on the subject\\nhad i formed one  it raises my influence much too high\\nthe power of dividing two people so tenderly attached\\nis too much for an indifferent person\\n\\ntis because you are an indifferent person said lucy\\nwith some pique and laying a particular stress on those words\\nthat your judgment might justly have such weight with me\\nif you could be supposed to be biased in any respect\\nby your own feelings your opinion would not be worth having\\n\\nelinor thought it wisest to make no answer to this\\nlest they might provoke each other to an unsuitable increase\\nof ease and unreserve and was even partly determined\\nnever to mention the subject again  another pause\\ntherefore of many minutes duration succeeded this speech\\nand lucy was still the first to end it\\n\\nshall you be in town this winter miss dashwood\\nsaid she with all her accustomary complacency\\n\\ncertainly not\\n\\ni am sorry for that returned the other\\nwhile her eyes brightened at the information\\nit would have gave me such pleasure to meet you there\\nbut i dare say you will go for all that  to be sure\\nyour brother and sister will ask you to come to them\\n\\nit will not be in my power to accept their invitation\\nif they do\\n\\nhow unlucky that is i had quite depended upon\\nmeeting you there  anne and me are to go the latter end\\nof january to some relations who have been wanting us to\\nvisit them these several years  but i only go for the sake\\nof seeing edward  he will be there in february otherwise\\nlondon would have no charms for me i have not spirits for it\\n\\nelinor was soon called to the cardtable by the\\nconclusion of the first rubber and the confidential\\ndiscourse of the two ladies was therefore at an end\\nto which both of them submitted without any reluctance\\nfor nothing had been said on either side to make them\\ndislike each other less than they had done before\\nand elinor sat down to the card table with the melancholy\\npersuasion that edward was not only without affection\\nfor the person who was to be his wife but that he had\\nnot even the chance of being tolerably happy in marriage\\nwhich sincere affection on her side would have given\\nfor selfinterest alone could induce a woman to keep a man\\nto an engagement of which she seemed so thoroughly aware\\nthat he was weary\\n\\nfrom this time the subject was never revived by elinor\\nand when entered on by lucy who seldom missed an opportunity\\nof introducing it and was particularly careful to inform\\nher confidante of her happiness whenever she received a letter\\nfrom edward it was treated by the former with calmness\\nand caution and dismissed as soon as civility would allow\\nfor she felt such conversations to be an indulgence which\\nlucy did not deserve and which were dangerous to herself\\n\\nthe visit of the miss steeles at barton park was\\nlengthened far beyond what the first invitation implied\\ntheir favour increased they could not be spared\\nsir john would not hear of their going and in spite\\nof their numerous and long arranged engagements in exeter\\nin spite of the absolute necessity of returning to fulfill\\nthem immediately which was in full force at the end\\nof every week they were prevailed on to stay nearly two\\nmonths at the park and to assist in the due celebration\\nof that festival which requires a more than ordinary\\nshare of private balls and large dinners to proclaim\\nits importance\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 25\\n\\n\\nthough mrs jennings was in the habit of spending a large\\nportion of the year at the houses of her children and friends\\nshe was not without a settled habitation of her own\\nsince the death of her husband who had traded with success\\nin a less elegant part of the town she had resided every\\nwinter in a house in one of the streets near portman square\\ntowards this home she began on the approach of january\\nto turn her thoughts and thither she one day abruptly\\nand very unexpectedly by them asked the elder misses\\ndashwood to accompany her  elinor without observing\\nthe varying complexion of her sister and the animated look\\nwhich spoke no indifference to the plan immediately gave\\na grateful but absolute denial for both in which she\\nbelieved herself to be speaking their united inclinations\\nthe reason alleged was their determined resolution\\nof not leaving their mother at that time of the year\\nmrs jennings received the refusal with some surprise\\nand repeated her invitation immediately\\n\\noh lord i am sure your mother can spare you\\nvery well and i do beg you will favour me with\\nyour company for ive quite set my heart upon it\\ndont fancy that you will be any inconvenience to me\\nfor i shant put myself at all out of my way for you\\nit will only be sending betty by the coach and i\\nhope i can afford that  we three shall be able to go\\nvery well in my chaise and when we are in town\\nif you do not like to go wherever i do well and good\\nyou may always go with one of my daughters  i am sure\\nyour mother will not object to it for i have had such\\ngood luck in getting my own children off my hands that she\\nwill think me a very fit person to have the charge of you\\nand if i dont get one of you at least well married\\nbefore i have done with you it shall not be my fault\\ni shall speak a good word for you to all the young men\\nyou may depend upon it\\n\\ni have a notion said sir john that miss marianne\\nwould not object to such a scheme if her elder sister\\nwould come into it  it is very hard indeed that she\\nshould not have a little pleasure because miss dashwood\\ndoes not wish it  so i would advise you two to set off\\nfor town when you are tired of barton without saying\\na word to miss dashwood about it\\n\\nnay cried mrs jennings i am sure i shall be\\nmonstrous glad of miss mariannes company whether miss\\ndashwood will go or not only the more the merrier say i\\nand i thought it would be more comfortable for them to\\nbe together because if they got tired of me they might talk\\nto one another and laugh at my old ways behind my back\\nbut one or the other if not both of them i must have\\nlord bless me how do you think i can live poking by myself\\ni who have been always used till this winter to have\\ncharlotte with me  come miss marianne let us strike\\nhands upon the bargain and if miss dashwood will change\\nher mind by and bye why so much the better\\n\\ni thank you maam sincerely thank you said marianne\\nwith warmth your invitation has insured my gratitude for ever\\nand it would give me such happiness yes almost the greatest\\nhappiness i am capable of to be able to accept it\\nbut my mother my dearest kindest motheri feel the\\njustice of what elinor has urged and if she were to be\\nmade less happy less comfortable by our absenceoh no\\nnothing should tempt me to leave her  it should not\\nmust not be a struggle\\n\\nmrs jennings repeated her assurance that mrs dashwood\\ncould spare them perfectly well and elinor who now\\nunderstood her sister and saw to what indifference to\\nalmost every thing else she was carried by her eagerness\\nto be with willoughby again made no farther direct\\nopposition to the plan and merely referred it to her\\nmothers decision from whom however she scarcely expected\\nto receive any support in her endeavour to prevent a visit\\nwhich she could not approve of for marianne and which\\non her own account she had particular reasons to avoid\\nwhatever marianne was desirous of her mother would be eager\\nto promoteshe could not expect to influence the latter\\nto cautiousness of conduct in an affair respecting which she\\nhad never been able to inspire her with distrust and she\\ndared not explain the motive of her own disinclination\\nfor going to london  that marianne fastidious as she was\\nthoroughly acquainted with mrs jennings manners\\nand invariably disgusted by them should overlook every\\ninconvenience of that kind should disregard whatever\\nmust be most wounding to her irritable feelings in her\\npursuit of one object was such a proof so strong\\nso full of the importance of that object to her as elinor\\nin spite of all that had passed was not prepared to witness\\n\\non being informed of the invitation mrs dashwood\\npersuaded that such an excursion would be productive\\nof much amusement to both her daughters and perceiving\\nthrough all her affectionate attention to herself\\nhow much the heart of marianne was in it would not hear\\nof their declining the offer upon her account insisted on\\ntheir both accepting it directly and then began to foresee\\nwith her usual cheerfulness a variety of advantages that\\nwould accrue to them all from this separation\\n\\ni am delighted with the plan she cried\\nit is exactly what i could wish  margaret and i shall\\nbe as much benefited by it as yourselves  when you\\nand the middletons are gone we shall go on so quietly\\nand happily together with our books and our music you\\nwill find margaret so improved when you come back again\\ni have a little plan of alteration for your bedrooms too\\nwhich may now be performed without any inconvenience\\nto any one  it is very right that you should go to town\\ni would have every young woman of your condition in life\\nacquainted with the manners and amusements of london\\nyou will be under the care of a motherly good sort\\nof woman of whose kindness to you i can have no doubt\\nand in all probability you will see your brother\\nand whatever may be his faults or the faults of his wife\\nwhen i consider whose son he is i cannot bear to have you so\\nwholly estranged from each other\\n\\nthough with your usual anxiety for our happiness\\nsaid elinor you have been obviating every impediment\\nto the present scheme which occurred to you there is\\nstill one objection which in my opinion cannot be so\\neasily removed\\n\\nmariannes countenance sunk\\n\\nand what said mrs dashwood is my dear prudent\\nelinor going to suggest  what formidable obstacle is she\\nnow to bring forward  do let me hear a word about the\\nexpense of it\\n\\nmy objection is this though i think very well of\\nmrs jenningss heart she is not a woman whose society\\ncan afford us pleasure or whose protection will give\\nus consequence\\n\\nthat is very true replied her mother but of\\nher society separately from that of other people\\nyou will scarcely have any thing at all and you will\\nalmost always appear in public with lady middleton\\n\\nif elinor is frightened away by her dislike of\\nmrs jennings said marianne at least it need not prevent\\nmy accepting her invitation  i have no such scruples\\nand i am sure i could put up with every unpleasantness\\nof that kind with very little effort\\n\\nelinor could not help smiling at this display of\\nindifference towards the manners of a person to whom she\\nhad often had difficulty in persuading marianne to behave\\nwith tolerable politeness and resolved within herself\\nthat if her sister persisted in going she would\\ngo likewise as she did not think it proper that marianne\\nshould be left to the sole guidance of her own judgment\\nor that mrs jennings should be abandoned to the mercy\\nof marianne for all the comfort of her domestic hours\\nto this determination she was the more easily reconciled\\nby recollecting that edward ferrars by lucys account\\nwas not to be in town before february and that\\ntheir visit without any unreasonable abridgement\\nmight be previously finished\\n\\ni will have you both go said mrs dashwood\\nthese objections are nonsensical  you will have much\\npleasure in being in london and especially in being together\\nand if elinor would ever condescend to anticipate enjoyment\\nshe would foresee it there from a variety of sources\\nshe would perhaps expect some from improving her\\nacquaintance with her sisterinlaws family\\n\\nelinor had often wished for an opportunity of\\nattempting to weaken her mothers dependence on the\\nattachment of edward and herself that the shock might\\nbe less when the whole truth were revealed and now\\non this attack though almost hopeless of success\\nshe forced herself to begin her design by saying\\nas calmly as she could i like edward ferrars very much\\nand shall always be glad to see him but as to the rest\\nof the family it is a matter of perfect indifference\\nto me whether i am ever known to them or not\\n\\nmrs dashwood smiled and said nothing\\nmarianne lifted up her eyes in astonishment and elinor\\nconjectured that she might as well have held her tongue\\n\\nafter very little farther discourse it was finally\\nsettled that the invitation should be fully accepted\\nmrs jennings received the information with a great\\ndeal of joy and many assurances of kindness and care\\nnor was it a matter of pleasure merely to her  sir john\\nwas delighted for to a man whose prevailing anxiety\\nwas the dread of being alone the acquisition of two\\nto the number of inhabitants in london was something\\neven lady middleton took the trouble of being delighted\\nwhich was putting herself rather out of her way\\nand as for the miss steeles especially lucy they had\\nnever been so happy in their lives as this intelligence\\nmade them\\n\\nelinor submitted to the arrangement which counteracted\\nher wishes with less reluctance than she had expected\\nto feel  with regard to herself it was now a matter\\nof unconcern whether she went to town or not and when\\nshe saw her mother so thoroughly pleased with the plan\\nand her sister exhilarated by it in look voice and manner\\nrestored to all her usual animation and elevated to more\\nthan her usual gaiety she could not be dissatisfied\\nwith the cause and would hardly allow herself to distrust\\nthe consequence\\n\\nmariannes joy was almost a degree beyond happiness\\nso great was the perturbation of her spirits and her\\nimpatience to be gone  her unwillingness to quit her\\nmother was her only restorative to calmness and at the\\nmoment of parting her grief on that score was excessive\\nher mothers affliction was hardly less and elinor\\nwas the only one of the three who seemed to consider\\nthe separation as any thing short of eternal\\n\\ntheir departure took place in the first week in january\\nthe middletons were to follow in about a week  the miss\\nsteeles kept their station at the park and were to quit\\nit only with the rest of the family\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 26\\n\\n\\nelinor could not find herself in the carriage with mrs jennings\\nand beginning a journey to london under her protection\\nand as her guest without wondering at her own situation\\nso short had their acquaintance with that lady been\\nso wholly unsuited were they in age and disposition\\nand so many had been her objections against such a measure\\nonly a few days before but these objections had all\\nwith that happy ardour of youth which marianne and her mother\\nequally shared been overcome or overlooked and elinor\\nin spite of every occasional doubt of willoughbys constancy\\ncould not witness the rapture of delightful expectation\\nwhich filled the whole soul and beamed in the eyes\\nof marianne without feeling how blank was her own prospect\\nhow cheerless her own state of mind in the comparison\\nand how gladly she would engage in the solicitude of\\nmariannes situation to have the same animating object\\nin view the same possibility of hope  a short a very\\nshort time however must now decide what willoughbys\\nintentions were in all probability he was already in town\\nmariannes eagerness to be gone declared her dependence\\non finding him there and elinor was resolved not only upon\\ngaining every new light as to his character which her\\nown observation or the intelligence of others could give her\\nbut likewise upon watching his behaviour to her sister\\nwith such zealous attention as to ascertain what he was\\nand what he meant before many meetings had taken place\\nshould the result of her observations be unfavourable\\nshe was determined at all events to open the eyes\\nof her sister should it be otherwise her exertions\\nwould be of a different natureshe must then learn\\nto avoid every selfish comparison and banish every regret\\nwhich might lessen her satisfaction in the happiness of marianne\\n\\nthey were three days on their journey and mariannes\\nbehaviour as they travelled was a happy specimen of what\\nfuture complaisance and companionableness to mrs jennings\\nmight be expected to be  she sat in silence almost all\\nthe way wrapt in her own meditations and scarcely ever\\nvoluntarily speaking except when any object of picturesque\\nbeauty within their view drew from her an exclamation\\nof delight exclusively addressed to her sister  to atone\\nfor this conduct therefore elinor took immediate possession\\nof the post of civility which she had assigned herself\\nbehaved with the greatest attention to mrs jennings\\ntalked with her laughed with her and listened to her\\nwhenever she could and mrs jennings on her side\\ntreated them both with all possible kindness was solicitous\\non every occasion for their ease and enjoyment and only\\ndisturbed that she could not make them choose their own\\ndinners at the inn nor extort a confession of their\\npreferring salmon to cod or boiled fowls to veal cutlets\\nthey reached town by three oclock the third day glad to\\nbe released after such a journey from the confinement\\nof a carriage and ready to enjoy all the luxury of a good fire\\n\\nthe house was handsome and handsomely fitted up\\nand the young ladies were immediately put in possession\\nof a very comfortable apartment  it had formerly\\nbeen charlottes and over the mantelpiece still hung\\na landscape in coloured silks of her performance\\nin proof of her having spent seven years at a great school\\nin town to some effect\\n\\nas dinner was not to be ready in less than two\\nhours from their arrival elinor determined to employ\\nthe interval in writing to her mother and sat down for\\nthat purpose  in a few moments marianne did the same\\ni am writing home marianne said elinor had not you\\nbetter defer your letter for a day or two\\n\\ni am not going to write to my mother\\nreplied marianne hastily and as if wishing to avoid\\nany farther inquiry  elinor said no more it immediately\\nstruck her that she must then be writing to willoughby\\nand the conclusion which as instantly followed was\\nthat however mysteriously they might wish to conduct\\nthe affair they must be engaged  this conviction\\nthough not entirely satisfactory gave her pleasure\\nand she continued her letter with greater alacrity\\nmariannes was finished in a very few minutes\\nin length it could be no more than a note it was then\\nfolded up sealed and directed with eager rapidity\\nelinor thought she could distinguish a large w in\\nthe direction and no sooner was it complete than marianne\\nringing the bell requested the footman who answered it\\nto get that letter conveyed for her to the twopenny post\\nthis decided the matter at once\\n\\nher spirits still continued very high but there\\nwas a flutter in them which prevented their giving much\\npleasure to her sister and this agitation increased as\\nthe evening drew on  she could scarcely eat any dinner\\nand when they afterwards returned to the drawing room\\nseemed anxiously listening to the sound of every carriage\\n\\nit was a great satisfaction to elinor that mrs jennings\\nby being much engaged in her own room could see little\\nof what was passing  the tea things were brought in\\nand already had marianne been disappointed more than once\\nby a rap at a neighbouring door when a loud one was suddenly\\nheard which could not be mistaken for one at any other house\\nelinor felt secure of its announcing willoughbys approach\\nand marianne starting up moved towards the door\\nevery thing was silent this could not be borne many seconds\\nshe opened the door advanced a few steps towards the stairs\\nand after listening half a minute returned into the room\\nin all the agitation which a conviction of having heard\\nhim would naturally produce in the ecstasy of her\\nfeelings at that instant she could not help exclaiming\\noh elinor it is willoughby indeed it is and seemed\\nalmost ready to throw herself into his arms when colonel\\nbrandon appeared\\n\\nit was too great a shock to be borne with calmness\\nand she immediately left the room  elinor was disappointed too\\nbut at the same time her regard for colonel brandon ensured\\nhis welcome with her and she felt particularly hurt that\\na man so partial to her sister should perceive that she\\nexperienced nothing but grief and disappointment in seeing him\\nshe instantly saw that it was not unnoticed by him\\nthat he even observed marianne as she quitted the room\\nwith such astonishment and concern as hardly left him\\nthe recollection of what civility demanded towards herself\\n\\nis your sister ill said he\\n\\nelinor answered in some distress that she was\\nand then talked of headaches low spirits and over fatigues\\nand of every thing to which she could decently attribute\\nher sisters behaviour\\n\\nhe heard her with the most earnest attention\\nbut seeming to recollect himself said no more on the subject\\nand began directly to speak of his pleasure at seeing them\\nin london making the usual inquiries about their journey\\nand the friends they had left behind\\n\\nin this calm kind of way with very little interest\\non either side they continued to talk both of them out\\nof spirits and the thoughts of both engaged elsewhere\\nelinor wished very much to ask whether willoughby were\\nthen in town but she was afraid of giving him pain\\nby any enquiry after his rival and at length by way\\nof saying something she asked if he had been in london\\never since she had seen him last  yes he replied\\nwith some embarrassment almost ever since i have been\\nonce or twice at delaford for a few days but it has never\\nbeen in my power to return to barton\\n\\nthis and the manner in which it was said\\nimmediately brought back to her remembrance all the\\ncircumstances of his quitting that place with the\\nuneasiness and suspicions they had caused to mrs jennings\\nand she was fearful that her question had implied\\nmuch more curiosity on the subject than she had ever felt\\n\\nmrs jennings soon came in  oh colonel said she\\nwith her usual noisy cheerfulness i am monstrous glad\\nto see yousorry i could not come beforebeg your\\npardon but i have been forced to look about me a little\\nand settle my matters for it is a long while since i\\nhave been at home and you know one has always a world\\nof little odd things to do after one has been away for\\nany time and then i have had cartwright to settle with\\nlord i have been as busy as a bee ever since dinner\\nbut pray colonel how came you to conjure out that i should\\nbe in town today\\n\\ni had the pleasure of hearing it at mr palmers\\nwhere i have been dining\\n\\noh you did well and how do they all do at their\\nhouse  how does charlotte do  i warrant you she is a fine\\nsize by this time\\n\\nmrs palmer appeared quite well and i am commissioned\\nto tell you that you will certainly see her tomorrow\\n\\nay to be sure i thought as much  well colonel\\ni have brought two young ladies with me you seethat is\\nyou see but one of them now but there is another somewhere\\nyour friend miss marianne toowhich you will not be\\nsorry to hear  i do not know what you and mr willoughby\\nwill do between you about her  ay it is a fine thing\\nto be young and handsome  well i was young once but i\\nnever was very handsomeworse luck for me  however i got\\na very good husband and i dont know what the greatest\\nbeauty can do more  ah poor man he has been dead\\nthese eight years and better  but colonel where have\\nyou been to since we parted  and how does your business\\ngo on  come come lets have no secrets among friends\\n\\nhe replied with his accustomary mildness to all\\nher inquiries but without satisfying her in any\\nelinor now began to make the tea and marianne was\\nobliged to appear again\\n\\nafter her entrance colonel brandon became\\nmore thoughtful and silent than he had been before\\nand mrs jennings could not prevail on him to stay long\\nno other visitor appeared that evening and the ladies\\nwere unanimous in agreeing to go early to bed\\n\\nmarianne rose the next morning with recovered spirits\\nand happy looks  the disappointment of the evening before\\nseemed forgotten in the expectation of what was to happen\\nthat day  they had not long finished their breakfast before\\nmrs palmers barouche stopped at the door and in a few\\nminutes she came laughing into the room so delighted\\nto see them all that it was hard to say whether she\\nreceived most pleasure from meeting her mother or the miss\\ndashwoods again  so surprised at their coming to town\\nthough it was what she had rather expected all along\\nso angry at their accepting her mothers invitation\\nafter having declined her own though at the same time\\nshe would never have forgiven them if they had not come\\n\\nmr palmer will be so happy to see you\\nsaid she what do you think he said when he heard\\nof your coming with mamma  i forget what it was now\\nbut it was something so droll\\n\\nafter an hour or two spent in what her mother called\\ncomfortable chat or in other words in every variety of inquiry\\nconcerning all their acquaintance on mrs jenningss side\\nand in laughter without cause on mrs palmers it was\\nproposed by the latter that they should all accompany\\nher to some shops where she had business that morning\\nto which mrs jennings and elinor readily consented\\nas having likewise some purchases to make themselves\\nand marianne though declining it at first was induced\\nto go likewise\\n\\nwherever they went she was evidently always on\\nthe watch  in bond street especially where much of\\ntheir business lay her eyes were in constant inquiry\\nand in whatever shop the party were engaged her mind was\\nequally abstracted from every thing actually before them\\nfrom all that interested and occupied the others\\nrestless and dissatisfied every where her sister could\\nnever obtain her opinion of any article of purchase\\nhowever it might equally concern them both she received\\nno pleasure from anything was only impatient to be at\\nhome again and could with difficulty govern her vexation\\nat the tediousness of mrs palmer whose eye was caught\\nby every thing pretty expensive or new who was wild\\nto buy all could determine on none and dawdled away her\\ntime in rapture and indecision\\n\\nit was late in the morning before they returned home\\nand no sooner had they entered the house than marianne flew\\neagerly up stairs and when elinor followed she found\\nher turning from the table with a sorrowful countenance\\nwhich declared that no willoughby had been there\\n\\nhas no letter been left here for me since we went out\\nsaid she to the footman who then entered with the parcels\\nshe was answered in the negative  are you quite sure\\nof it she replied  are you certain that no servant\\nno porter has left any letter or note\\n\\nthe man replied that none had\\n\\nhow very odd said she in a low and disappointed\\nvoice as she turned away to the window\\n\\nhow odd indeed repeated elinor within herself\\nregarding her sister with uneasiness  if she had not\\nknown him to be in town she would not have written to him\\nas she did she would have written to combe magna\\nand if he is in town how odd that he should neither\\ncome nor write  oh my dear mother you must be wrong\\nin permitting an engagement between a daughter so young\\na man so little known to be carried on in so doubtful\\nso mysterious a manner  i long to inquire and how will my\\ninterference be borne\\n\\nshe determined after some consideration that if\\nappearances continued many days longer as unpleasant as they\\nnow were she would represent in the strongest manner\\nto her mother the necessity of some serious enquiry into the\\naffair\\n\\nmrs palmer and two elderly ladies of mrs jenningss\\nintimate acquaintance whom she had met and invited\\nin the morning dined with them  the former left them\\nsoon after tea to fulfill her evening engagements\\nand elinor was obliged to assist in making a whist table\\nfor the others  marianne was of no use on these occasions\\nas she would never learn the game but though her time\\nwas therefore at her own disposal the evening was by no\\nmeans more productive of pleasure to her than to elinor\\nfor it was spent in all the anxiety of expectation and the\\npain of disappointment  she sometimes endeavoured for a\\nfew minutes to read but the book was soon thrown aside\\nand she returned to the more interesting employment\\nof walking backwards and forwards across the room\\npausing for a moment whenever she came to the window\\nin hopes of distinguishing the longexpected rap\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 27\\n\\n\\nif this open weather holds much longer said mrs jennings\\nwhen they met at breakfast the following morning\\nsir john will not like leaving barton next week\\ntis a sad thing for sportsmen to lose a days pleasure\\npoor souls  i always pity them when they do they seem\\nto take it so much to heart\\n\\nthat is true cried marianne in a cheerful voice\\nand walking to the window as she spoke to examine the day\\ni had not thought of that  this weather will keep many\\nsportsmen in the country\\n\\nit was a lucky recollection all her good spirits were\\nrestored by it  it is charming weather for them indeed\\nshe continued as she sat down to the breakfast table\\nwith a happy countenance  how much they must enjoy\\nit but with a little return of anxiety it cannot\\nbe expected to last long  at this time of the year\\nand after such a series of rain we shall certainly\\nhave very little more of it  frosts will soon set in\\nand in all probability with severity  in another day\\nor two perhaps this extreme mildness can hardly last\\nlongernay perhaps it may freeze tonight\\n\\nat any rate said elinor wishing to prevent\\nmrs jennings from seeing her sisters thoughts as clearly\\nas she did i dare say we shall have sir john and lady\\nmiddleton in town by the end of next week\\n\\nay my dear ill warrant you we do  mary always\\nhas her own way\\n\\nand now silently conjectured elinor she will\\nwrite to combe by this days post\\n\\nbut if she did the letter was written and sent away\\nwith a privacy which eluded all her watchfulness to ascertain\\nthe fact  whatever the truth of it might be and far\\nas elinor was from feeling thorough contentment about it\\nyet while she saw marianne in spirits she could not be\\nvery uncomfortable herself  and marianne was in spirits\\nhappy in the mildness of the weather and still happier\\nin her expectation of a frost\\n\\nthe morning was chiefly spent in leaving cards at\\nthe houses of mrs jenningss acquaintance to inform\\nthem of her being in town and marianne was all the time\\nbusy in observing the direction of the wind watching the\\nvariations of the sky and imagining an alteration in the air\\n\\ndont you find it colder than it was in the morning\\nelinor there seems to me a very decided difference\\ni can hardly keep my hands warm even in my muff  it was\\nnot so yesterday i think  the clouds seem parting too\\nthe sun will be out in a moment and we shall have a\\nclear afternoon\\n\\nelinor was alternately diverted and pained\\nbut marianne persevered and saw every night in the\\nbrightness of the fire and every morning in the appearance\\nof the atmosphere the certain symptoms of approaching frost\\n\\nthe miss dashwoods had no greater reason to be\\ndissatisfied with mrs jenningss style of living and set\\nof acquaintance than with her behaviour to themselves\\nwhich was invariably kind  every thing in her household\\narrangements was conducted on the most liberal plan\\nand excepting a few old city friends whom to lady\\nmiddletons regret she had never dropped she visited\\nno one to whom an introduction could at all discompose\\nthe feelings of her young companions  pleased to find\\nherself more comfortably situated in that particular than\\nshe had expected elinor was very willing to compound\\nfor the want of much real enjoyment from any of their\\nevening parties which whether at home or abroad\\nformed only for cards could have little to amuse her\\n\\ncolonel brandon who had a general invitation\\nto the house was with them almost every day he came\\nto look at marianne and talk to elinor who often derived\\nmore satisfaction from conversing with him than from any\\nother daily occurrence but who saw at the same time\\nwith much concern his continued regard for her sister\\nshe feared it was a strengthening regard  it grieved her\\nto see the earnestness with which he often watched marianne\\nand his spirits were certainly worse than when at barton\\n\\nabout a week after their arrival it became\\ncertain that willoughby was also arrived  his card\\nwas on the table when they came in from the mornings drive\\n\\ngood god cried marianne he has been here while\\nwe were out  elinor rejoiced to be assured of his\\nbeing in london now ventured to say depend upon it\\nhe will call again tomorrow  but marianne seemed\\nhardly to hear her and on mrs jennings entrance\\nescaped with the precious card\\n\\nthis event while it raised the spirits of elinor\\nrestored to those of her sister all and more than all\\ntheir former agitation  from this moment her mind was\\nnever quiet the expectation of seeing him every hour\\nof the day made her unfit for any thing  she insisted\\non being left behind the next morning when the others\\nwent out\\n\\nelinors thoughts were full of what might be passing\\nin berkeley street during their absence but a moments\\nglance at her sister when they returned was enough to\\ninform her that willoughby had paid no second visit there\\na note was just then brought in and laid on the table\\n\\nfor me cried marianne stepping hastily forward\\n\\nno maam for my mistress\\n\\nbut marianne not convinced took it instantly up\\n\\nit is indeed for mrs jennings how provoking\\n\\nyou are expecting a letter then said elinor\\nunable to be longer silent\\n\\nyes a littlenot much\\n\\nafter a short pause  you have no confidence\\nin me marianne\\n\\nnay elinor this reproach from youyou who have\\nconfidence in no one\\n\\nme returned elinor in some confusion indeed\\nmarianne i have nothing to tell\\n\\nnor i answered marianne with energy our situations\\nthen are alike  we have neither of us any thing to tell\\nyou because you do not communicate and i because\\ni conceal nothing\\n\\nelinor distressed by this charge of reserve in herself\\nwhich she was not at liberty to do away knew not how\\nunder such circumstances to press for greater openness\\nin marianne\\n\\nmrs jennings soon appeared and the note being\\ngiven her she read it aloud  it was from lady middleton\\nannouncing their arrival in conduit street the night before\\nand requesting the company of her mother and cousins\\nthe following evening  business on sir johns part\\nand a violent cold on her own prevented their calling\\nin berkeley street  the invitation was accepted\\nbut when the hour of appointment drew near necessary as\\nit was in common civility to mrs jennings that they\\nshould both attend her on such a visit elinor had some\\ndifficulty in persuading her sister to go for still\\nshe had seen nothing of willoughby and therefore was\\nnot more indisposed for amusement abroad than unwilling\\nto run the risk of his calling again in her absence\\n\\nelinor found when the evening was over\\nthat disposition is not materially altered by a change\\nof abode for although scarcely settled in town\\nsir john had contrived to collect around him nearly twenty\\nyoung people and to amuse them with a ball  this was\\nan affair however of which lady middleton did not approve\\nin the country an unpremeditated dance was very allowable\\nbut in london where the reputation of elegance was more\\nimportant and less easily attained it was risking too much\\nfor the gratification of a few girls to have it known that\\nlady middleton had given a small dance of eight or nine couple\\nwith two violins and a mere sideboard collation\\n\\nmr and mrs palmer were of the party from the former\\nwhom they had not seen before since their arrival in town\\nas he was careful to avoid the appearance of any attention\\nto his motherinlaw and therefore never came near her\\nthey received no mark of recognition on their entrance\\nhe looked at them slightly without seeming to know\\nwho they were and merely nodded to mrs jennings from\\nthe other side of the room  marianne gave one glance\\nround the apartment as she entered it was enoughhe\\nwas not thereand she sat down equally illdisposed\\nto receive or communicate pleasure  after they had been\\nassembled about an hour mr palmer sauntered towards\\nthe miss dashwoods to express his surprise on seeing them\\nin town though colonel brandon had been first informed\\nof their arrival at his house and he had himself said\\nsomething very droll on hearing that they were to come\\n\\ni thought you were both in devonshire said he\\n\\ndid you replied elinor\\n\\nwhen do you go back again\\n\\ni do not know and thus ended their discourse\\n\\nnever had marianne been so unwilling to dance\\nin her life as she was that evening and never so much\\nfatigued by the exercise  she complained of it\\nas they returned to berkeley street\\n\\naye aye said mrs jennings we know the reason\\nof all that very well if a certain person who shall\\nbe nameless had been there you would not have been a\\nbit tired and to say the truth it was not very pretty\\nof him not to give you the meeting when he was invited\\n\\ninvited cried marianne\\n\\nso my daughter middleton told me for it seems sir\\njohn met him somewhere in the street this morning\\nmarianne said no more but looked exceedingly hurt\\nimpatient in this situation to be doing something\\nthat might lead to her sisters relief elinor resolved\\nto write the next morning to her mother and hoped\\nby awakening her fears for the health of marianne\\nto procure those inquiries which had been so long delayed\\nand she was still more eagerly bent on this measure\\nby perceiving after breakfast on the morrow that marianne\\nwas again writing to willoughby for she could not suppose\\nit to be to any other person\\n\\nabout the middle of the day mrs jennings went out by\\nherself on business and elinor began her letter directly\\nwhile marianne too restless for employment too anxious\\nfor conversation walked from one window to the other\\nor sat down by the fire in melancholy meditation\\nelinor was very earnest in her application to her mother\\nrelating all that had passed her suspicions of\\nwilloughbys inconstancy urging her by every plea\\nof duty and affection to demand from marianne an account\\nof her real situation with respect to him\\n\\nher letter was scarcely finished when a rap\\nforetold a visitor and colonel brandon was announced\\nmarianne who had seen him from the window and who hated\\ncompany of any kind left the room before he entered it\\nhe looked more than usually grave and though expressing\\nsatisfaction at finding miss dashwood alone as if he\\nhad somewhat in particular to tell her sat for some\\ntime without saying a word  elinor persuaded that he\\nhad some communication to make in which her sister\\nwas concerned impatiently expected its opening\\nit was not the first time of her feeling the same kind\\nof conviction for more than once before beginning with\\nthe observation of your sister looks unwell today\\nor your sister seems out of spirits he had appeared\\non the point either of disclosing or of inquiring\\nsomething particular about her  after a pause of several\\nminutes their silence was broken by his asking her\\nin a voice of some agitation when he was to congratulate\\nher on the acquisition of a brother  elinor was not\\nprepared for such a question and having no answer ready\\nwas obliged to adopt the simple and common expedient\\nof asking what he meant  he tried to smile as he replied\\nyour sisters engagement to mr willoughby is very generally\\nknown\\n\\nit cannot be generally known returned elinor\\nfor her own family do not know it\\n\\nhe looked surprised and said i beg your pardon\\ni am afraid my inquiry has been impertinent but i had not\\nsupposed any secrecy intended as they openly correspond\\nand their marriage is universally talked of\\n\\nhow can that be by whom can you have heard\\nit mentioned\\n\\nby manyby some of whom you know nothing by others\\nwith whom you are most intimate mrs jennings mrs palmer\\nand the middletons  but still i might not have believed it\\nfor where the mind is perhaps rather unwilling to\\nbe convinced it will always find something to support\\nits doubts if i had not when the servant let me in today\\naccidentally seen a letter in his hand directed to\\nmr willoughby in your sisters writing  i came to inquire\\nbut i was convinced before i could ask the question\\nis every thing finally settled  is it impossible to\\nbut i have no right and i could have no chance of succeeding\\nexcuse me miss dashwood  i believe i have been wrong\\nin saying so much but i hardly know what to do and on\\nyour prudence i have the strongest dependence  tell me\\nthat it is all absolutely resolved on that any attempt\\nthat in short concealment if concealment be possible\\nis all that remains\\n\\nthese words which conveyed to elinor a direct avowal\\nof his love for her sister affected her very much\\nshe was not immediately able to say anything and even\\nwhen her spirits were recovered she debated for a short\\ntime on the answer it would be most proper to give\\nthe real state of things between willoughby and her sister\\nwas so little known to herself that in endeavouring\\nto explain it she might be as liable to say too much\\nas too little  yet as she was convinced that mariannes\\naffection for willoughby could leave no hope of colonel\\nbrandons success whatever the event of that affection\\nmight be and at the same time wished to shield her conduct\\nfrom censure she thought it most prudent and kind\\nafter some consideration to say more than she really knew\\nor believed  she acknowledged therefore that though\\nshe had never been informed by themselves of the terms\\non which they stood with each other of their mutual\\naffection she had no doubt and of their correspondence\\nshe was not astonished to hear\\n\\nhe listened to her with silent attention and on\\nher ceasing to speak rose directly from his seat\\nand after saying in a voice of emotion to your sister\\ni wish all imaginable happiness to willoughby that he\\nmay endeavour to deserve hertook leave and went away\\n\\nelinor derived no comfortable feelings from this\\nconversation to lessen the uneasiness of her mind on\\nother points she was left on the contrary with a\\nmelancholy impression of colonel brandons unhappiness\\nand was prevented even from wishing it removed\\nby her anxiety for the very event that must confirm it\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 28\\n\\n\\nnothing occurred during the next three or four days\\nto make elinor regret what she had done in applying\\nto her mother for willoughby neither came nor wrote\\nthey were engaged about the end of that time to attend\\nlady middleton to a party from which mrs jennings was\\nkept away by the indisposition of her youngest daughter\\nand for this party marianne wholly dispirited\\ncareless of her appearance and seeming equally indifferent\\nwhether she went or staid prepared without one look\\nof hope or one expression of pleasure  she sat by the\\ndrawingroom fire after tea till the moment of lady\\nmiddletons arrival without once stirring from her seat\\nor altering her attitude lost in her own thoughts\\nand insensible of her sisters presence and when at\\nlast they were told that lady middleton waited for them\\nat the door she started as if she had forgotten that\\nany one was expected\\n\\nthey arrived in due time at the place of destination\\nand as soon as the string of carriages before them\\nwould allow alighted ascended the stairs heard their\\nnames announced from one landingplace to another in an\\naudible voice and entered a room splendidly lit up\\nquite full of company and insufferably hot  when they had\\npaid their tribute of politeness by curtsying to the lady\\nof the house they were permitted to mingle in the crowd\\nand take their share of the heat and inconvenience to\\nwhich their arrival must necessarily add  after some time\\nspent in saying little or doing less lady middleton sat\\ndown to cassino and as marianne was not in spirits for\\nmoving about she and elinor luckily succeeding to chairs\\nplaced themselves at no great distance from the table\\n\\nthey had not remained in this manner long before elinor\\nperceived willoughby standing within a few yards\\nof them in earnest conversation with a very fashionable\\nlooking young woman  she soon caught his eye and he\\nimmediately bowed but without attempting to speak to her\\nor to approach marianne though he could not but see her\\nand then continued his discourse with the same lady\\nelinor turned involuntarily to marianne to see whether\\nit could be unobserved by her  at that moment she first\\nperceived him and her whole countenance glowing with\\nsudden delight she would have moved towards him instantly\\nhad not her sister caught hold of her\\n\\ngood heavens she exclaimed he is therehe\\nis thereoh why does he not look at me why cannot\\ni speak to him\\n\\npray pray be composed cried elinor and do\\nnot betray what you feel to every body present\\nperhaps he has not observed you yet\\n\\nthis however was more than she could believe herself\\nand to be composed at such a moment was not only beyond\\nthe reach of marianne it was beyond her wish  she sat\\nin an agony of impatience which affected every feature\\n\\nat last he turned round again and regarded them both\\nshe started up and pronouncing his name in a tone\\nof affection held out her hand to him  he approached\\nand addressing himself rather to elinor than marianne\\nas if wishing to avoid her eye and determined not to\\nobserve her attitude inquired in a hurried manner after\\nmrs dashwood and asked how long they had been in town\\nelinor was robbed of all presence of mind by such an address\\nand was unable to say a word  but the feelings of her sister\\nwere instantly expressed  her face was crimsoned over\\nand she exclaimed in a voice of the greatest emotion\\ngood god willoughby what is the meaning of this\\nhave you not received my letters  will you not shake\\nhands with me\\n\\nhe could not then avoid it but her touch seemed\\npainful to him and he held her hand only for a moment\\nduring all this time he was evidently struggling for composure\\nelinor watched his countenance and saw its expression\\nbecoming more tranquil  after a moments pause he spoke\\nwith calmness\\n\\ni did myself the honour of calling in berkeley\\nstreet last tuesday and very much regretted that i was\\nnot fortunate enough to find yourselves and mrs jennings\\nat home  my card was not lost i hope\\n\\nbut have you not received my notes cried marianne\\nin the wildest anxiety  here is some mistake i am\\nsuresome dreadful mistake  what can be the meaning\\nof it  tell me willoughby for heavens sake tell me\\nwhat is the matter\\n\\nhe made no reply his complexion changed and all his\\nembarrassment returned but as if on catching the eye\\nof the young lady with whom he had been previously talking\\nhe felt the necessity of instant exertion he recovered\\nhimself again and after saying yes i had the pleasure\\nof receiving the information of your arrival in town\\nwhich you were so good as to send me turned hastily away\\nwith a slight bow and joined his friend\\n\\nmarianne now looking dreadfully white and unable\\nto stand sunk into her chair and elinor expecting every\\nmoment to see her faint tried to screen her from the\\nobservation of others while reviving her with lavender water\\n\\ngo to him elinor she cried as soon as she\\ncould speak and force him to come to me  tell him\\ni must see him againmust speak to him instantly\\ni cannot resti shall not have a moments peace till this\\nis explainedsome dreadful misapprehension or other\\noh go to him this moment\\n\\nhow can that be done no my dearest marianne\\nyou must wait  this is not the place for explanations\\nwait only till tomorrow\\n\\nwith difficulty however could she prevent her\\nfrom following him herself and to persuade her to check\\nher agitation to wait at least with the appearance\\nof composure till she might speak to him with more privacy\\nand more effect was impossible for marianne continued\\nincessantly to give way in a low voice to the misery\\nof her feelings by exclamations of wretchedness\\nin a short time elinor saw willoughby quit the room by the\\ndoor towards the staircase and telling marianne that he\\nwas gone urged the impossibility of speaking to him again\\nthat evening as a fresh argument for her to be calm\\nshe instantly begged her sister would entreat lady\\nmiddleton to take them home as she was too miserable\\nto stay a minute longer\\n\\nlady middleton though in the middle of a rubber\\non being informed that marianne was unwell was too\\npolite to object for a moment to her wish of going away\\nand making over her cards to a friend they departed\\nas soon the carriage could be found  scarcely a word\\nwas spoken during their return to berkeley street\\nmarianne was in a silent agony too much oppressed even\\nfor tears but as mrs jennings was luckily not come home\\nthey could go directly to their own room where hartshorn\\nrestored her a little to herself  she was soon undressed\\nand in bed and as she seemed desirous of being alone\\nher sister then left her and while she waited the return\\nof mrs jennings had leisure enough for thinking over\\nthe past\\n\\nthat some kind of engagement had subsisted\\nbetween willoughby and marianne she could not doubt\\nand that willoughby was weary of it seemed equally clear\\nfor however marianne might still feed her own wishes\\nshe could not attribute such behaviour to mistake\\nor misapprehension of any kind  nothing but a thorough\\nchange of sentiment could account for it  her indignation\\nwould have been still stronger than it was had she\\nnot witnessed that embarrassment which seemed to speak\\na consciousness of his own misconduct and prevented\\nher from believing him so unprincipled as to have been\\nsporting with the affections of her sister from the first\\nwithout any design that would bear investigation\\nabsence might have weakened his regard and convenience\\nmight have determined him to overcome it but that such\\na regard had formerly existed she could not bring herself\\nto doubt\\n\\nas for marianne on the pangs which so unhappy a meeting\\nmust already have given her and on those still more\\nsevere which might await her in its probable consequence\\nshe could not reflect without the deepest concern\\nher own situation gained in the comparison for while she\\ncould esteem edward as much as ever however they might be\\ndivided in future her mind might be always supported\\nbut every circumstance that could embitter such an evil\\nseemed uniting to heighten the misery of marianne\\nin a final separation from willoughbyin an immediate\\nand irreconcilable rupture with him\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 29\\n\\n\\nbefore the housemaid had lit their fire the next day\\nor the sun gained any power over a cold gloomy morning\\nin january marianne only half dressed was kneeling\\nagainst one of the windowseats for the sake of all\\nthe little light she could command from it and writing\\nas fast as a continual flow of tears would permit her\\nin this situation elinor roused from sleep by her agitation\\nand sobs first perceived her and after observing her\\nfor a few moments with silent anxiety said in a tone\\nof the most considerate gentleness\\n\\nmarianne may i ask\\n\\nno elinor she replied ask nothing you will\\nsoon know all\\n\\nthe sort of desperate calmness with which this was said\\nlasted no longer than while she spoke and was immediately\\nfollowed by a return of the same excessive affliction\\nit was some minutes before she could go on with her letter\\nand the frequent bursts of grief which still obliged her\\nat intervals to withhold her pen were proofs enough of her\\nfeeling how more than probable it was that she was writing\\nfor the last time to willoughby\\n\\nelinor paid her every quiet and unobtrusive attention\\nin her power and she would have tried to sooth and\\ntranquilize her still more had not marianne entreated her\\nwith all the eagerness of the most nervous irritability\\nnot to speak to her for the world  in such circumstances\\nit was better for both that they should not be long together\\nand the restless state of mariannes mind not only prevented\\nher from remaining in the room a moment after she was dressed\\nbut requiring at once solitude and continual change of place\\nmade her wander about the house till breakfast time avoiding\\nthe sight of every body\\n\\nat breakfast she neither ate nor attempted to eat\\nany thing and elinors attention was then all employed\\nnot in urging her not in pitying her nor in appearing\\nto regard her but in endeavouring to engage mrs jennings\\nnotice entirely to herself\\n\\nas this was a favourite meal with mrs jennings\\nit lasted a considerable time and they were just setting\\nthemselves after it round the common working table when a\\nletter was delivered to marianne which she eagerly caught\\nfrom the servant and turning of a deathlike paleness\\ninstantly ran out of the room  elinor who saw as plainly\\nby this as if she had seen the direction that it must\\ncome from willoughby felt immediately such a sickness\\nat heart as made her hardly able to hold up her head\\nand sat in such a general tremour as made her fear it\\nimpossible to escape mrs jennings notice  that good lady\\nhowever saw only that marianne had received a letter\\nfrom willoughby which appeared to her a very good joke\\nand which she treated accordingly by hoping with a laugh\\nthat she would find it to her liking  of elinors distress\\nshe was too busily employed in measuring lengths of worsted\\nfor her rug to see any thing at all and calmly continuing\\nher talk as soon as marianne disappeared she said\\n\\nupon my word i never saw a young woman so\\ndesperately in love in my life  my girls were nothing\\nto her and yet they used to be foolish enough but as\\nfor miss marianne she is quite an altered creature\\ni hope from the bottom of my heart he wont keep her\\nwaiting much longer for it is quite grievous to see her\\nlook so ill and forlorn  pray when are they to be married\\n\\nelinor though never less disposed to speak than at\\nthat moment obliged herself to answer such an attack\\nas this and therefore trying to smile replied and have\\nyou really maam talked yourself into a persuasion\\nof my sisters being engaged to mr willoughby  i thought\\nit had been only a joke but so serious a question seems\\nto imply more and i must beg therefore that you will not\\ndeceive yourself any longer  i do assure you that nothing\\nwould surprise me more than to hear of their being going\\nto be married\\n\\nfor shame for shame miss dashwood how can you\\ntalk so  dont we all know that it must be a match that\\nthey were over head and ears in love with each other from\\nthe first moment they met  did not i see them together\\nin devonshire every day and all day long and did not i\\nknow that your sister came to town with me on purpose\\nto buy wedding clothes  come come this wont do\\nbecause you are so sly about it yourself you think nobody\\nelse has any senses but it is no such thing i can tell you\\nfor it has been known all over town this ever so long\\ni tell every body of it and so does charlotte\\n\\nindeed maam said elinor very seriously\\nyou are mistaken  indeed you are doing a very unkind thing\\nin spreading the report and you will find that you have\\nthough you will not believe me now\\n\\nmrs jennings laughed again but elinor had not\\nspirits to say more and eager at all events to know\\nwhat willoughby had written hurried away to their room\\nwhere on opening the door she saw marianne stretched on\\nthe bed almost choked by grief one letter in her hand\\nand two or three others laying by her  elinor drew near\\nbut without saying a word and seating herself on the bed\\ntook her hand kissed her affectionately several times\\nand then gave way to a burst of tears which at first\\nwas scarcely less violent than mariannes the latter\\nthough unable to speak seemed to feel all the tenderness\\nof this behaviour and after some time thus spent in\\njoint affliction she put all the letters into elinors hands\\nand then covering her face with her handkerchief\\nalmost screamed with agony  elinor who knew that such grief\\nshocking as it was to witness it must have its course\\nwatched by her till this excess of suffering had somewhat\\nspent itself and then turning eagerly to willoughbys letter\\nread as follows\\n\\n                              bond street january\\n     my dear madam\\n\\n     i have just had the honour of receiving your\\n     letter for which i beg to return my sincere\\n     acknowledgments  i am much concerned to find there\\n     was anything in my behaviour last night that did\\n     not meet your approbation and though i am quite at\\n     a loss to discover in what point i could be so\\n     unfortunate as to offend you i entreat your\\n     forgiveness of what i can assure you to have been\\n     perfectly unintentional  i shall never reflect on\\n     my former acquaintance with your family in devonshire\\n     without the most grateful pleasure and flatter\\n     myself it will not be broken by any mistake or\\n     misapprehension of my actions  my esteem for your\\n     whole family is very sincere but if i have been so\\n     unfortunate as to give rise to a belief of more than\\n     i felt or meant to express i shall reproach myself\\n     for not having been more guarded in my professions\\n     of that esteem  that i should ever have meant more\\n     you will allow to be impossible when you understand\\n     that my affections have been long engaged elsewhere\\n     and it will not be many weeks i believe before\\n     this engagement is fulfilled  it is with great\\n     regret that i obey your commands in returning the\\n     letters with which i have been honoured from you\\n     and the lock of hair which you so obligingly bestowed\\n     on me\\n\\n     i am dear madam\\n               your most obedient\\n                    humble servant\\n                                        john willoughby\\n\\n\\nwith what indignation such a letter as this must\\nbe read by miss dashwood may be imagined  though aware\\nbefore she began it that it must bring a confession\\nof his inconstancy and confirm their separation for ever\\nshe was not aware that such language could be suffered\\nto announce it nor could she have supposed willoughby\\ncapable of departing so far from the appearance of every\\nhonourable and delicate feelingso far from the common\\ndecorum of a gentleman as to send a letter so impudently\\ncruel a letter which instead of bringing with his desire\\nof a release any professions of regret acknowledged no\\nbreach of faith denied all peculiar affection whatever\\na letter of which every line was an insult and which\\nproclaimed its writer to be deep in hardened villainy\\n\\nshe paused over it for some time with indignant\\nastonishment then read it again and again but every\\nperusal only served to increase her abhorrence of the man\\nand so bitter were her feelings against him that she\\ndared not trust herself to speak lest she might wound\\nmarianne still deeper by treating their disengagement\\nnot as a loss to her of any possible good but as an\\nescape from the worst and most irremediable of all\\nevils a connection for life with an unprincipled man\\nas a deliverance the most real a blessing the most important\\n\\nin her earnest meditations on the contents of the letter\\non the depravity of that mind which could dictate it\\nand probably on the very different mind of a very different\\nperson who had no other connection whatever with the affair\\nthan what her heart gave him with every thing that passed\\nelinor forgot the immediate distress of her sister\\nforgot that she had three letters on her lap yet unread\\nand so entirely forgot how long she had been in the room\\nthat when on hearing a carriage drive up to the door\\nshe went to the window to see who could be coming so\\nunreasonably early she was all astonishment to perceive\\nmrs jenningss chariot which she knew had not been\\nordered till one  determined not to quit marianne\\nthough hopeless of contributing at present to her ease\\nshe hurried away to excuse herself from attending\\nmrs jennings on account of her sister being indisposed\\nmrs jennings with a thoroughly goodhumoured concern\\nfor its cause admitted the excuse most readily and elinor\\nafter seeing her safe off returned to marianne whom she\\nfound attempting to rise from the bed and whom she reached\\njust in time to prevent her from falling on the floor\\nfaint and giddy from a long want of proper rest and food\\nfor it was many days since she had any appetite and many\\nnights since she had really slept and now when her\\nmind was no longer supported by the fever of suspense\\nthe consequence of all this was felt in an aching head\\na weakened stomach and a general nervous faintness\\na glass of wine which elinor procured for her directly\\nmade her more comfortable and she was at last able to express\\nsome sense of her kindness by saying\\n\\npoor elinor how unhappy i make you\\n\\ni only wish replied her sister there were\\nany thing i could do which might be of comfort to you\\n\\nthis as every thing else would have been\\nwas too much for marianne who could only exclaim\\nin the anguish of her heart oh elinor i am miserable\\nindeed before her voice was entirely lost in sobs\\n\\nelinor could no longer witness this torrent\\nof unresisted grief in silence\\n\\nexert yourself dear marianne she cried\\nif you would not kill yourself and all who love you\\nthink of your mother think of her misery while you suffer\\nfor her sake you must exert yourself\\n\\ni cannot i cannot cried marianne leave me\\nleave me if i distress you leave me hate me forget me\\nbut do not torture me so  oh how easy for those\\nwho have no sorrow of their own to talk of exertion  happy\\nhappy elinor you cannot have an idea of what i suffer\\n\\ndo you call me happy marianne  ah if you knewand\\ncan you believe me to be so while i see you so wretched\\n\\nforgive me forgive me throwing her arms round\\nher sisters neck i know you feel for me i know what\\na heart you have but yet you areyou must be happy\\nedward loves youwhat oh what can do away such happiness\\nas that\\n\\nmany many circumstances said elinor solemnly\\n\\nno no no cried marianne wildly he loves you\\nand only you  you can have no grief\\n\\ni can have no pleasure while i see you in this state\\n\\nand you will never see me otherwise  mine is\\na misery which nothing can do away\\n\\nyou must not talk so marianne  have you no\\ncomforts no friends  is your loss such as leaves\\nno opening for consolation  much as you suffer now\\nthink of what you would have suffered if the discovery\\nof his character had been delayed to a later period\\nif your engagement had been carried on for months and months\\nas it might have been before he chose to put an end to it\\nevery additional day of unhappy confidence on your side\\nwould have made the blow more dreadful\\n\\nengagement cried marianne there has been\\nno engagement\\n\\nno engagement\\n\\nno he is not so unworthy as you believe him\\nhe has broken no faith with me\\n\\nbut he told you that he loved you\\n\\nyesnonever absolutely  it was every day implied\\nbut never professedly declared  sometimes i thought it\\nhad beenbut it never was\\n\\nyet you wrote to him\\n\\nyescould that be wrong after all that had passed\\nbut i cannot talk\\n\\nelinor said no more and turning again to the three\\nletters which now raised a much stronger curiosity\\nthan before directly ran over the contents of all\\nthe first which was what her sister had sent him\\non their arrival in town was to this effect\\n\\n                         berkeley street january\\n\\n     how surprised you will be willoughby on\\n     receiving this and i think you will feel something\\n     more than surprise when you know that i am in town\\n     an opportunity of coming hither though with mrs\\n     jennings was a temptation we could not resist\\n     i wish you may receive this in time to come here\\n     tonight but i will not depend on it  at any rate\\n     i shall expect you tomorrow for the present adieu\\n\\n                                             md\\n\\nher second note which had been written on the morning\\nafter the dance at the middletons was in these words\\n\\n     i cannot express my disappointment in having\\n     missed you the day before yesterday nor my astonishment\\n     at not having received any answer to a note which\\n     i sent you above a week ago  i have been expecting\\n     to hear from you and still more to see you every\\n     hour of the day  pray call again as soon as possible\\n     and explain the reason of my having expected this\\n     in vain  you had better come earlier another time\\n     because we are generally out by one  we were last\\n     night at lady middletons where there was a dance\\n     i have been told that you were asked to be of the\\n     party  but could it be so  you must be very much\\n     altered indeed since we parted if that could be\\n     the case and you not there  but i will not suppose\\n     this possible and i hope very soon to receive your\\n     personal assurance of its being otherwise\\n\\n                                            md\\n\\nthe contents of her last note to him were these\\n\\n     what am i to imagine willoughby by your\\n     behaviour last night  again i demand an explanation\\n     of it  i was prepared to meet you with the pleasure\\n     which our separation naturally produced with the\\n     familiarity which our intimacy at barton appeared\\n     to me to justify  i was repulsed indeed i have\\n     passed a wretched night in endeavouring to excuse\\n     a conduct which can scarcely be called less than\\n     insulting but though i have not yet been able to\\n     form any reasonable apology for your behaviour\\n     i am perfectly ready to hear your justification of\\n     it  you have perhaps been misinformed or purposely\\n     deceived in something concerning me which may have\\n     lowered me in your opinion  tell me what it is\\n     explain the grounds on which you acted and i shall\\n     be satisfied in being able to satisfy you  it\\n     would grieve me indeed to be obliged to think ill\\n     of you but if i am to do it if i am to learn that\\n     you are not what we have hitherto believed you that\\n     your regard for us all was insincere that your\\n     behaviour to me was intended only to deceive let\\n     it be told as soon as possible  my feelings are at\\n     present in a state of dreadful indecision i wish\\n     to acquit you but certainty on either side will be\\n     ease to what i now suffer  if your sentiments are\\n     no longer what they were you will return my notes\\n     and the lock of my hair which is in your possession\\n\\n                                             md\\n\\nthat such letters so full of affection and confidence\\ncould have been so answered elinor for willoughbys sake\\nwould have been unwilling to believe  but her condemnation\\nof him did not blind her to the impropriety of their\\nhaving been written at all and she was silently grieving\\nover the imprudence which had hazarded such unsolicited\\nproofs of tenderness not warranted by anything preceding\\nand most severely condemned by the event when marianne\\nperceiving that she had finished the letters observed to\\nher that they contained nothing but what any one would\\nhave written in the same situation\\n\\ni felt myself she added to be as solemnly\\nengaged to him as if the strictest legal covenant\\nhad bound us to each other\\n\\ni can believe it said elinor but unfortunately\\nhe did not feel the same\\n\\nhe did feel the same elinorfor weeks and weeks he\\nfelt it  i know he did  whatever may have changed him now and\\nnothing but the blackest art employed against me can have done\\nit i was once as dear to him as my own soul could wish\\nthis lock of hair which now he can so readily give up\\nwas begged of me with the most earnest supplication\\nhad you seen his look his manner had you heard his voice\\nat that moment  have you forgot the last evening of our\\nbeing together at barton  the morning that we parted\\ntoo  when he told me that it might be many weeks before\\nwe met againhis distresscan i ever forget his distress\\n\\nfor a moment or two she could say no more\\nbut when this emotion had passed away she added\\nin a firmer tone\\n\\nelinor i have been cruelly used but not by willoughby\\n\\ndearest marianne who but himself  by whom can he\\nhave been instigated\\n\\nby all the world rather than by his own heart\\ni

thoughtfully from the fire to the window\\nfrom the window to the fire without knowing that she\\nreceived warmth from one or discerning objects through\\nthe other and marianne seated at the foot of the bed\\nwith her head leaning against one of its posts\\nagain took up willoughbys letter and after shuddering\\nover every sentence exclaimed\\n\\nit is too much oh willoughby willoughby could

questions\\nand remarks of all these people  the middletons and\\npalmershow am i to bear their pity  the pity of such\\na woman as lady middleton  oh what would he say to that\\n\\nelinor advised her to lie down again and for a\\nmoment she did so but no attitude could give her ease\\nand in restless pain of mind and body she moved from one\\nposture to another till growing more and more hysterical\\nher sister could with difficulty keep her on the bed at all\\nand for some time was fearful of being constrained to call\\nfor assistance  some lavender drops however which she\\nwas at length persuaded to take were of use and from\\nthat time till mrs jennings returned she continued\\non the bed quiet and motionless\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 30\\n\\n\\nmrs jennings came immediately to their room on her return\\nand without waiting to have her request of admittance answered\\nopened the door and walked in with a look of real concern\\n\\nhow do you do my dearsaid she in a voice of great\\ncompassion to marianne who turned away her face without\\nattempting to answer\\n\\nhow is she miss dashwoodpoor thing she looks very bad\\nno wonder  ay it is but too true  he is to be married\\nvery soona goodfornothing fellow  i have no patience\\nwith him  mrs taylor told me of it half an hour ago\\nand she was told it by a particular friend of miss\\ngrey herself else i am sure i should not have believed it\\nand i was almost ready to sink as it was  well said i\\nall i can say is that if this be true he has used\\na young lady of my acquaintance abominably ill and i\\nwish with all my soul his wife may plague his heart out\\nand so i shall always say my dear you may depend on it\\ni have no notion of mens going on in this way and if ever\\ni meet him again i will give him such a dressing as he\\nhas not had this many a day  but there is one comfort\\nmy dear miss marianne he is not the only young man\\nin the world worth having and with your pretty face\\nyou will never want admirers  well poor thing  i wont\\ndisturb her any longer for she had better have her cry\\nout at once and have done with  the parrys and sandersons\\nluckily are coming tonight you know and that will amuse her\\n\\nshe then went away walking on tiptoe out of the room\\nas if she supposed her young friends affliction could\\nbe increased by noise\\n\\nmarianne to the surprise of her sister\\ndetermined on dining with them  elinor even advised\\nher against it  but no she would go down she could\\nbear it very well and the bustle about her would\\nbe less  elinor pleased to have her governed for a\\nmoment by such a motive though believing it hardly\\npossible that she could sit out the dinner said no more\\nand adjusting her dress for her as well as she could\\nwhile marianne still remained on the bed was ready\\nto assist her into the dining room as soon as they were\\nsummoned to it\\n\\nwhen there though looking most wretchedly\\nshe ate more and was calmer than her sister had expected\\nhad she tried to speak or had she been conscious of half\\nmrs jenningss wellmeant but illjudged attentions\\nto her this calmness could not have been maintained\\nbut not a syllable escaped her lips and the abstraction\\nof her thoughts preserved her in ignorance of every thing\\nthat was passing before her\\n\\nelinor who did justice to mrs jenningss kindness\\nthough its effusions were often distressing and sometimes\\nalmost ridiculous made her those acknowledgments\\nand returned her those civilities which her sister could\\nnot make or return for herself  their good friend saw\\nthat marianne was unhappy and felt that every thing\\nwas due to her which might make her at all less so\\nshe treated her therefore with all the indulgent fondness\\nof a parent towards a favourite child on the last day of\\nits holidays  marianne was to have the best place by the fire\\nwas to be tempted to eat by every delicacy in the house\\nand to be amused by the relation of all the news of the day\\nhad not elinor in the sad countenance of her sister\\nseen a check to all mirth she could have been entertained\\nby mrs jenningss endeavours to cure a disappointment in love\\nby a variety of sweetmeats and olives and a good fire\\nas soon however as the consciousness of all this was\\nforced by continual repetition on marianne she could\\nstay no longer  with a hasty exclamation of misery\\nand a sign to her sister not to follow her she directly got\\nup and hurried out of the room\\n\\npoor soul cried mrs jennings as soon as she was gone\\nhow it grieves me to see her  and i declare if she is\\nnot gone away without finishing her wine  and the dried\\ncherries too  lord nothing seems to do her any good\\ni am sure if i knew of any thing she would like i would\\nsend all over the town for it  well it is the oddest\\nthing to me that a man should use such a pretty girl\\nso ill  but when there is plenty of money on one side\\nand next to none on the other lord bless you they care\\nno more about such things\\n\\nthe lady thenmiss grey i think you called her\\nis very rich\\n\\nfifty thousand pounds my dear  did you ever see\\nher a smart stylish girl they say but not handsome\\ni remember her aunt very well biddy henshawe she married\\na very wealthy man  but the family are all rich together\\nfifty thousand pounds and by all accounts it wont come\\nbefore its wanted for they say he is all to pieces\\nno wonder dashing about with his curricle and hunters\\nwell it dont signify talking but when a young man\\nbe who he will comes and makes love to a pretty girl\\nand promises marriage he has no business to fly off\\nfrom his word only because he grows poor and a richer\\ngirl is ready to have him  why dont he in such a case\\nsell his horses let his house turn off his servants\\nand make a thorough reform at once i warrant you\\nmiss marianne would have been ready to wait till matters\\ncame round  but that wont do nowadays nothing in the\\nway of pleasure can ever be given up by the young men of\\nthis age\\n\\ndo you know what kind of a girl miss grey is\\nis she said to be amiable\\n\\ni never heard any harm of her indeed i hardly ever\\nheard her mentioned except that mrs taylor did say\\nthis morning that one day miss walker hinted to her\\nthat she believed mr and mrs ellison would not be sorry\\nto have miss grey married for she and mrs ellison could\\nnever agree\\n\\nand who are the ellisons\\n\\nher guardians my dear  but now she is of age\\nand may choose for herself and a pretty choice she has\\nmadewhat now after pausing a momentyour poor sister\\nis gone to her own room i suppose to moan by herself\\nis there nothing one can get to comfort her  poor dear\\nit seems quite cruel to let her be alone  well byandby we\\nshall have a few friends and that will amuse her a little\\nwhat shall we play at  she hates whist i know but is there\\nno round game she cares for\\n\\ndear maam this kindness is quite unnecessary\\nmarianne i dare say will not leave her room again\\nthis evening  i shall persuade her if i can to go\\nearly to bed for i am sure she wants rest\\n\\naye i believe that will be best for her  let her name\\nher own supper and go to bed  lord no wonder she has\\nbeen looking so bad and so cast down this last week or two\\nfor this matter i suppose has been hanging over her head as\\nlong as that  and so the letter that came today finished it\\npoor soul  i am sure if i had had a notion of it\\ni would not have joked her about it for all my money\\nbut then you know how should i guess such a thing  i made\\nsure of its being nothing but a common love letter and\\nyou know young people like to be laughed at about them  lord\\nhow concerned sir john and my daughters will be when they\\nhear it  if i had my senses about me i might have called\\nin conduit street in my way home and told them of it\\nbut i shall see them tomorrow\\n\\nit would be unnecessary i am sure for you to caution\\nmrs palmer and sir john against ever naming mr willoughby\\nor making the slightest allusion to what has passed\\nbefore my sister  their own goodnature must point out\\nto them the real cruelty of appearing to know any thing\\nabout it when she is present and the less that may ever\\nbe said to myself on the subject the more my feelings\\nwill be spared as you my dear madam will easily believe\\n\\noh lord yes that i do indeed  it must be terrible\\nfor you to hear it talked of and as for your sister\\ni am sure i would not mention a word about it to her\\nfor the world  you saw i did not all dinner time\\nno more would sir john nor my daughters for they are\\nall very thoughtful and considerate especially if i\\ngive them a hint as i certainly will  for my part\\ni think the less that is said about such things the better\\nthe sooner tis blown over and forgot  and what does\\ntalking ever do you know\\n\\nin this affair it can only do harm more so\\nperhaps than in many cases of a similar kind for it\\nhas been attended by circumstances which for the sake\\nof every one concerned in it make it unfit to become\\nthe public conversation  i must do this justice to\\nmr willoughbyhe has broken no positive engagement\\nwith my sister\\n\\nlaw my dear  dont pretend to defend him\\nno positive engagement indeed after taking her all\\nover allenham house and fixing on the very rooms they\\nwere to live in hereafter\\n\\nelinor for her sisters sake could not press the\\nsubject farther and she hoped it was not required of her\\nfor willoughbys since though marianne might lose much\\nhe could gain very little by the enforcement of the real truth\\nafter a short silence on both sides mrs jennings\\nwith all her natural hilarity burst forth again\\n\\nwell my dear tis a true saying about an illwind\\nfor it will be all the better for colonel brandon\\nhe will have her at last aye that he will  mind me\\nnow if they ant married by midsummer  lord how hell\\nchuckle over this news  i hope he will come tonight\\nit will be all to one a better match for your sister\\ntwo thousand a year without debt or drawbackexcept\\nthe little lovechild indeed aye i had forgot her\\nbut she may be prenticed out at a small cost and then\\nwhat does it signify  delaford is a nice place i can\\ntell you exactly what i call a nice old fashioned place\\nfull of comforts and conveniences quite shut in with great\\ngarden walls that are covered with the best fruittrees\\nin the country and such a mulberry tree in one corner\\nlord how charlotte and i did stuff the only time we\\nwere there  then there is a dovecote some delightful\\nstewponds and a very pretty canal and every thing\\nin short that one could wish for and moreover it is\\nclose to the church and only a quarter of a mile from\\nthe turnpikeroad so tis never dull for if you only\\ngo and sit up in an old yew arbour behind the house\\nyou may see all the carriages that pass along\\noh tis a nice place  a butcher hard by in the village\\nand the parsonagehouse within a stones throw\\nto my fancy a thousand times prettier than barton park\\nwhere they are forced to send three miles for their meat\\nand have not a neighbour nearer than your mother\\nwell i shall spirit up the colonel as soon as i can\\none shoulder of mutton you know drives another down\\nif we can but put willoughby out of her head\\n\\nay if we can do that maam said elinor\\nwe shall do very well with or without colonel brandon\\nand then rising she went away to join marianne\\nwhom she found as she expected in her own room leaning\\nin silent misery over the small remains of a fire\\nwhich till elinors entrance had been her only light\\n\\nyou had better leave me was all the notice\\nthat her sister received from her\\n\\ni will leave you said elinor if you will go\\nto bed but this from the momentary perverseness\\nof impatient suffering she at first refused to do\\nher sisters earnest though gentle persuasion however\\nsoon softened her to compliance and elinor saw her\\nlay her aching head on the pillow and as she hoped\\nin a way to get some quiet rest before she left her\\n\\nin the drawingroom whither she then repaired\\nshe was soon joined by mrs jennings with a wineglass\\nfull of something in her hand\\n\\nmy dear said she entering i have just recollected\\nthat i have some of the finest old constantia wine in the\\nhouse that ever was tasted so i have brought a glass of it\\nfor your sister  my poor husband how fond he was of it\\nwhenever he had a touch of his old colicky gout he said\\nit did him more good than any thing else in the world\\ndo take it to your sister\\n\\ndear maam replied elinor smiling at the difference\\nof the complaints for which it was recommended how good\\nyou are  but i have just left marianne in bed and i hope\\nalmost asleep and as i think nothing will be of so much\\nservice to her as rest if you will give me leave\\ni will drink the wine myself\\n\\nmrs jennings though regretting that she had not been\\nfive minutes earlier was satisfied with the compromise\\nand elinor as she swallowed the chief of it reflected\\nthat though its effects on a colicky gout were at present\\nof little importance to her its healing powers\\non a disappointed heart might be as reasonably tried\\non herself as on her sister\\n\\ncolonel brandon came in while the party were at tea\\nand by his manner of looking round the room for marianne\\nelinor immediately fancied that he neither expected\\nnor wished to see her there and in short that he\\nwas already aware of what occasioned her absence\\nmrs jennings was not struck by the same thought\\nfor soon after his entrance she walked across the room\\nto the teatable where elinor presided and whispered\\nthe colonel looks as grave as ever you see  he knows\\nnothing of it do tell him my dear\\n\\nhe shortly afterwards drew a chair close to hers\\nand with a look which perfectly assured her of his\\ngood information inquired after her sister\\n\\nmarianne is not well said she  she has been\\nindisposed all day and we have persuaded her to go to bed\\n\\nperhaps then he hesitatingly replied what i\\nheard this morning may bethere may be more truth in it\\nthan i could believe possible at first\\n\\nwhat did you hear\\n\\nthat a gentleman whom i had reason to thinkin short\\nthat a man whom i knew to be engagedbut how shall i\\ntell you  if you know it already as surely you must\\ni may be spared\\n\\nyou mean answered elinor with forced calmness\\nmr willoughbys marriage with miss grey  yes we do\\nknow it all  this seems to have been a day of general\\nelucidation for this very morning first unfolded it to us\\nmr willoughby is unfathomable  where did you hear it\\n\\nin a stationers shop in pall mall where i\\nhad business  two ladies were waiting for their carriage\\nand one of them was giving the other an account of the\\nintended match in a voice so little attempting concealment\\nthat it was impossible for me not to hear all  the name\\nof willoughby john willoughby frequently repeated\\nfirst caught my attention and what followed was a positive\\nassertion that every thing was now finally settled\\nrespecting his marriage with miss greyit was no longer\\nto be a secretit would take place even within a few weeks\\nwith many particulars of preparations and other matters\\none thing especially i remember because it served\\nto identify the man still moreas soon as the ceremony\\nwas over they were to go to combe magna his seat\\nin somersetshire  my astonishmentbut it would be\\nimpossible to describe what i felt  the communicative\\nlady i learnt on inquiry for i stayed in the shop\\ntill they were gone was a mrs ellison and that as i\\nhave been since informed is the name of miss greys guardian\\n\\nit is  but have you likewise heard that miss grey\\nhas fifty thousand pounds  in that if in any thing\\nwe may find an explanation\\n\\nit may be so but willoughby is capableat least\\ni thinkhe stopped a moment then added in a voice\\nwhich seemed to distrust itself and your sister\\nhow did she\\n\\nher sufferings have been very severe  i have\\nonly to hope that they may be proportionately short\\nit has been it is a most cruel affliction  till yesterday\\ni believe she never doubted his regard and even now\\nperhapsbut i am almost convinced that he never was\\nreally attached to her  he has been very deceitful and\\nin some points there seems a hardness of heart about him\\n\\nah said colonel brandon there is indeed  but\\nyour sister does noti think you said soshe does\\nnot consider quite as you do\\n\\nyou know her disposition and may believe how eagerly\\nshe would still justify him if she could\\n\\nhe made no answer and soon afterwards by the removal\\nof the teathings and the arrangement of the card parties\\nthe subject was necessarily dropped  mrs jennings who had\\nwatched them with pleasure while they were talking and who\\nexpected to see the effect of miss dashwoods communication\\nin such an instantaneous gaiety on colonel brandons side\\nas might have become a man in the bloom of youth of hope\\nand happiness saw him with amazement remain the whole\\nevening more serious and thoughtful than usual\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 31\\n\\n\\nfrom a night of more sleep than she had expected\\nmarianne awoke the next morning to the same consciousness\\nof misery in which she had closed her eyes\\n\\nelinor encouraged her as much as possible to talk\\nof what she felt and before breakfast was ready they had\\ngone through the subject again and again and with the same\\nsteady conviction and affectionate counsel on elinors side\\nthe same impetuous feelings and varying opinions on\\nmariannes as before  sometimes she could believe\\nwilloughby to be as unfortunate and as innocent as herself\\nand at others lost every consolation in the impossibility\\nof acquitting him  at one moment she was absolutely\\nindifferent to the observation of all the world at another\\nshe would seclude herself from it for ever and at a third\\ncould resist it with energy  in one thing however\\nshe was uniform when it came to the point in avoiding\\nwhere it was possible the presence of mrs jennings\\nand in a determined silence when obliged to endure it\\nher heart was hardened against the belief of mrs jenningss\\nentering into her sorrows with any compassion\\n\\nno no no it cannot be she cried\\nshe cannot feel  her kindness is not sympathy\\nher goodnature is not tenderness  all that she wants\\nis gossip and she only likes me now because i supply it\\n\\nelinor had not needed this to be assured of the injustice\\nto which her sister was often led in her opinion of others\\nby the irritable refinement of her own mind and the too\\ngreat importance placed by her on the delicacies of a\\nstrong sensibility and the graces of a polished manner\\nlike half the rest of the world if more than half there\\nbe that are clever and good marianne with excellent\\nabilities and an excellent disposition was neither\\nreasonable nor candid  she expected from other people\\nthe same opinions and feelings as her own and she judged\\nof their motives by the immediate effect of their actions\\non herself  thus a circumstance occurred while the\\nsisters were together in their own room after breakfast\\nwhich sunk the heart of mrs jennings still lower\\nin her estimation because through her own weakness\\nit chanced to prove a source of fresh pain to herself\\nthough mrs jennings was governed in it by an impulse\\nof the utmost goodwill\\n\\nwith a letter in her outstretched hand and countenance\\ngaily smiling from the persuasion of bringing comfort\\nshe entered their room saying\\n\\nnow my dear i bring you something that i am sure\\nwill do you good\\n\\nmarianne heard enough  in one moment her imagination\\nplaced before her a letter from willoughby full of tenderness\\nand contrition explanatory of all that had passed satisfactory\\nconvincing and instantly followed by willoughby himself\\nrushing eagerly into the room to inforce at her feet\\nby the eloquence of his eyes the assurances of his letter\\nthe work of one moment was destroyed by the next\\nthe hand writing of her mother never till then unwelcome\\nwas before her and in the acuteness of the disappointment\\nwhich followed such an ecstasy of more than hope\\nshe felt as if till that instant she had never suffered\\n\\nthe cruelty of mrs jennings no language within\\nher reach in her moments of happiest eloquence\\ncould have expressed and now she could reproach her\\nonly by the tears which streamed from her eyes with\\npassionate violencea reproach however so entirely\\nlost on its object that after many expressions of pity\\nshe withdrew still referring her to the letter of comfort\\nbut the letter when she was calm enough to read it\\nbrought little comfort  willoughby filled every page\\nher mother still confident of their engagement and relying\\nas warmly as ever on his constancy had only been roused\\nby elinors application to intreat from marianne greater\\nopenness towards them both and this with such tenderness\\ntowards her such affection for willoughby and such\\na conviction of their future happiness in each other\\nthat she wept with agony through the whole of it\\n\\nall her impatience to be at home again now returned\\nher mother was dearer to her than ever dearer through\\nthe very excess of her mistaken confidence in willoughby\\nand she was wildly urgent to be gone  elinor unable herself\\nto determine whether it were better for marianne to be\\nin london or at barton offered no counsel of her own\\nexcept of patience till their mothers wishes could be known\\nand at length she obtained her sisters consent to wait\\nfor that knowledge\\n\\nmrs jennings left them earlier than usual for she\\ncould not be easy till the middletons and palmers were able\\nto grieve as much as herself and positively refusing\\nelinors offered attendance went out alone for the rest\\nof the morning  elinor with a very heavy heart aware of\\nthe pain she was going to communicate and perceiving\\nby mariannes letter how ill she had succeeded in laying\\nany foundation for it then sat down to write her mother\\nan account of what had passed and entreat her directions\\nfor the future while marianne who came into the drawingroom\\non mrs jenningss going away remained fixed at the table\\nwhere elinor wrote watching the advancement of her pen\\ngrieving over her for the hardship of such a task\\nand grieving still more fondly over its effect on her mother\\n\\nin this manner they had continued about a quarter\\nof an hour when marianne whose nerves could not then\\nbear any sudden noise was startled by a rap at the door\\n\\nwho can this be cried elinor  so early too i\\nthought we had been safe\\n\\nmarianne moved to the window\\n\\nit is colonel brandon said she with vexation\\nwe are never safe from him\\n\\nhe will not come in as mrs jennings is from home\\n\\ni will not trust to that retreating to her own room\\na man who has nothing to do with

elinor who was convinced that\\nsolicitude for marianne brought him thither and who saw\\nthat solicitude in his disturbed and melancholy look\\nand in his anxious though brief inquiry after her\\ncould not forgive her sister for esteeming him so lightly\\n\\ni met mrs jennings in bond street said he\\nafter the first salutation and she encouraged me\\nto come on and i was the more easily

me a very awkward narrator\\nmiss dashwood i hardly know where to begin  a short\\naccount of myself i believe will be necessary and it\\nshall be a short one  on such a subject sighing heavily\\ncan i have little temptation to be diffuse\\n\\nhe stopt a moment for recollection and then\\nwith another sigh went on\\n\\nyou have probably entirely forgotten a conversation\\nit is not to be supposed that it could make any impression\\non youa conversation between us one evening at barton\\nparkit was the evening of a dancein which i alluded\\nto a lady i had once known as resembling in some measure\\nyour sister marianne\\n\\nindeed answered elinor i have not forgotten it\\nhe looked pleased by this remembrance and added\\n\\nif i am not deceived by the uncertainty the partiality\\nof tender recollection there is a very strong resemblance\\nbetween them as well in mind as person  the same warmth\\nof heart the same eagerness of fancy and spirits\\nthis lady was one of my nearest relations an orphan from\\nher infancy and under the guardianship of my father\\nour ages were nearly the same and from our earliest years\\nwe were playfellows and friends  i cannot remember the\\ntime when i did not love eliza and my affection for her\\nas we grew up was such as perhaps judging from my\\npresent forlorn and cheerless gravity you might think me\\nincapable of having ever felt  hers for me was i believe\\nfervent as the attachment of your sister to mr willoughby\\nand it was though from a different cause no less unfortunate\\nat seventeen she was lost to me for ever  she was\\nmarriedmarried against her inclination to my brother\\nher fortune was large and our family estate much encumbered\\nand this i fear is all that can be said for the\\nconduct of one who was at once her uncle and guardian\\nmy brother did not deserve her he did not even love her\\ni had hoped that her regard for me would support her\\nunder any difficulty and for some time it did but at\\nlast the misery of her situation for she experienced\\ngreat unkindness overcame all her resolution and though\\nshe had promised me that nothingbut how blindly i\\nrelate  i have never told you how this was brought on\\nwe were within a few hours of eloping together for scotland\\nthe treachery or the folly of my cousins maid betrayed us\\ni was banished to the house of a relation far distant\\nand she was allowed no liberty no society no amusement\\ntill my fathers point was gained  i had depended on her\\nfortitude too far and the blow was a severe one\\nbut had her marriage been happy so young as i then was\\na few months must have reconciled me to it or at least\\ni should not have now to lament it  this however\\nwas not the case  my brother had no regard for her\\nhis pleasures were not what they ought to have been\\nand from the first he treated her unkindly  the consequence\\nof this upon a mind so young so lively so inexperienced\\nas mrs brandons was but too natural  she resigned\\nherself at first to all the misery of her situation\\nand happy had it been if she had not lived to overcome those\\nregrets which the remembrance of me occasioned  but can we\\nwonder that with such a husband to provoke inconstancy\\nand without a friend to advise or restrain her for\\nmy father lived only a few months after their marriage\\nand i was with my regiment in the east indies she\\nshould fall  had i remained in england perhapsbut i\\nmeant to promote the happiness of both by removing\\nfrom her for years and for that purpose had procured\\nmy exchange  the shock which her marriage had given me\\nhe continued in a voice of great agitation was of\\ntrifling weightwas nothing to what i felt when i heard\\nabout two years afterwards of her divorce  it was\\nthat which threw this gloomeven now the recollection\\nof what i suffered\\n\\nhe could say no more and rising hastily walked for a few\\nminutes about the room  elinor affected by his relation\\nand still more by his distress could not speak  he saw\\nher concern and coming to her took her hand pressed it\\nand kissed it with grateful respect  a few minutes more\\nof silent exertion enabled him to proceed with composure\\n\\nit was nearly three years after this unhappy\\nperiod before i returned to england  my first care\\nwhen i did arrive was of course to seek for her\\nbut the search was as fruitless as it was melancholy\\ni could not trace her beyond her first seducer and there\\nwas every reason to fear that she had removed from him\\nonly to sink deeper in a life of sin  her legal allowance\\nwas not adequate to her fortune nor sufficient for her\\ncomfortable maintenance and i learnt from my brother that\\nthe power of receiving it had been made over some months\\nbefore to another person  he imagined and calmly could he\\nimagine it that her extravagance and consequent distress\\nhad obliged her to dispose of it for some immediate relief\\nat last however and after i had been six months in england\\ni did find her  regard for a former servant of my own\\nwho had since fallen into misfortune carried me to visit\\nhim in a spunginghouse where he was confined for debt\\nand there the same house under a similar confinement\\nwas my unfortunate sister  so alteredso fadedworn\\ndown by acute suffering of every kind hardly could i\\nbelieve the melancholy and sickly figure before me\\nto be the remains of the lovely blooming healthful girl\\non whom i had once doted  what i endured in so beholding\\nherbut i have no right to wound your feelings by attempting\\nto describe iti have pained you too much already\\nthat she was to all appearance in the last stage\\nof a consumption wasyes in such a situation it was\\nmy greatest comfort  life could do nothing for her\\nbeyond giving time for a better preparation for death\\nand that was given  i saw her placed in comfortable lodgings\\nand under proper attendants i

but to what does all this\\nlead  i seem to have been distressing you for nothing\\nah miss dashwooda subject such as thisuntouched\\nfor fourteen yearsit is dangerous to handle it at all\\ni will be more collectedmore concise  she left to my care\\nher only child a little girl the offspring of her first\\nguilty connection who was then about three years old\\nshe loved the child and had always kept it with her\\nit was a valued a precious trust to me and gladly\\nwould i have discharged it in the strictest sense\\nby watching over her education myself had the nature\\nof our situations allowed it but i had no family no home\\nand my little eliza was therefore placed at school\\ni saw her there whenever i could and after the death of my\\nbrother which happened about five years ago and which\\nleft to me the possession of the family property she\\nvisited me at delaford  i called her a distant relation\\nbut i am well aware that i have in general been suspected\\nof a much nearer connection with her  it is now three\\nyears ago she had just reached her fourteenth year\\nthat i removed her from school to place her under the care\\nof a very respectable woman residing in dorsetshire\\nwho had the charge of four or five other girls of about\\nthe same time of life and for two years i had every reason\\nto be pleased with her situation  but last february\\nalmost a twelvemonth back she suddenly disappeared\\ni had allowed her imprudently as it has since turned\\nout at her earnest desire to go to bath with one of\\nher young friends who was attending her father there\\nfor his health  i knew him to be a very good sort of man\\nand i thought well of his daughterbetter than she deserved\\nfor with a most obstinate and illjudged secrecy\\nshe would tell nothing would give no clue though she\\ncertainly knew all  he her father a wellmeaning\\nbut not a quicksighted man could really i believe\\ngive no information for he had been generally confined\\nto the house while the girls were ranging over the town\\nand making what acquaintance they chose and he tried\\nto convince me as thoroughly as he was convinced himself\\nof his daughters being entirely unconcerned in the business\\nin short i could learn nothing but that she was gone\\nall the rest for eight long months was left to conjecture\\nwhat i thought what i feared may be imagined and what i\\nsuffered too\\n\\ngood heavens cried elinor could it becould\\nwilloughby\\n\\nthe first news that reached me of her he continued\\ncame in a letter from herself last october\\nit was forwarded to me from delaford and i received it\\non the very morning of our intended party to whitwell\\nand this was the reason of my leaving barton so suddenly\\nwhich i am sure must at the time have appeared strange\\nto every body and which i believe gave offence to some\\nlittle did mr willoughby imagine i suppose when his\\nlooks censured me for incivility in breaking up the party\\nthat i was called away to the relief of one whom he\\nhad made poor and miserable but had he known it\\nwhat would it have availed  would he have been less\\ngay or less happy in the smiles of your sister  no\\nhe had already done that which no man who can feel\\nfor another would do  he had left the girl whose\\nyouth and innocence he had seduced in a situation of\\nthe utmost distress with no creditable home no

now before you expensive dissipated\\nand worse than both  knowing all this as i have now\\nknown it many weeks guess what i must have felt on seeing\\nyour sister as fond of him as ever and on being assured\\nthat she was to marry him guess what i must have felt\\nfor all your sakes  when i came to you last week and\\nfound you alone i came determined to know the truth\\nthough irresolute what to

of interfering with success and sometimes\\ni thought your sisters influence might yet reclaim him\\nbut now after such dishonorable usage who can tell what\\nwere his designs on her  whatever they may have been\\nhowever she may now and hereafter doubtless will\\nturn with gratitude towards her own condition when she\\ncompares it with that of my poor eliza when she considers\\nthe wretched and hopeless situation of this poor girl\\nand pictures her to herself with an affection for him so strong\\nstill as strong as her own and with a mind tormented\\nby selfreproach which must attend her through life\\nsurely this comparison must have its use with her\\nshe will feel her own sufferings to be nothing  they\\nproceed from no misconduct and can bring no disgrace\\non the contrary every

communicating to her what i have told you  you must\\nknow best what will be its effect but had i not seriously\\nand from my heart believed it might be of service\\nmight lessen her regrets i would not have suffered\\nmyself to trouble you with this account of my family\\nafflictions with a recital which may seem to have been\\nintended to raise myself at the expense of others\\n\\nelinors

though most reluctantly the name of her lover\\nand when he returned to town which was within a fortnight\\nafter myself we met by appointment he to defend\\ni to punish his conduct  we returned unwounded\\nand the meeting therefore never got abroad\\n\\nelinor sighed over the fancied necessity of this\\nbut to a man and a soldier she presumed not to censure it\\n\\nsuch said colonel brandon after a pause\\nhas been the unhappy resemblance between the fate of mother\\nand daughter and so imperfectly have i discharged my trust\\n\\nis she still in town\\n\\nno as soon as she recovered from her lyingin\\nfor i found her near her delivery i removed her and her\\nchild into the country and there she remains\\n\\nrecollecting soon afterwards that he was probably\\ndividing elinor from her

particulars of this conversation were repeated\\nby miss dashwood to her sister as they very soon were\\nthe effect on her was not entirely such as the former\\nhad hoped to see  not that marianne appeared to distrust\\nthe truth of any part of it for she listened to it all\\nwith the most steady and submissive attention made neither\\nobjection nor remark attempted no vindication of willoughby\\nand seemed to shew by her tears that she felt it to\\nbe impossible  but though this behaviour assured elinor\\nthat the conviction of this guilt was carried home to\\nher mind though she saw with satisfaction the effect of it\\nin her no longer avoiding colonel brandon when he called\\nin her speaking to him even voluntarily speaking\\nwith a kind of compassionate respect and though she\\nsaw her spirits less violently irritated than before\\nshe did not see her less wretched  her mind did become\\nsettled but it was settled in a gloomy dejection\\nshe felt the loss of willoughbys character yet more heavily\\nthan she had felt the loss of his heart his seduction and\\ndesertion of miss williams the misery of that poor girl\\nand the doubt of what his designs might once have been\\non herself preyed altogether so much on her spirits\\nthat she could not bring herself to speak of what she felt\\neven to elinor and brooding over her sorrows in silence\\ngave more pain to her sister than could have been communicated\\nby the most open and most frequent confession of them\\n\\nto give the feelings or the language of mrs dashwood\\non receiving and answering elinors letter would be only\\nto give a repetition of what her daughters had already felt\\nand said of a disappointment hardly less painful than\\nmariannes and an indignation even greater than elinors\\nlong letters from her quickly succeeding each other\\narrived to tell all that she suffered and thought\\nto express her anxious solicitude for marianne and entreat\\nshe would bear up with fortitude under this misfortune\\nbad indeed must the nature of mariannes affliction be\\nwhen her mother could talk of fortitude mortifying\\nand humiliating must be the origin of those regrets\\nwhich she could wish her not to indulge\\n\\nagainst the interest of her own individual comfort\\nmrs dashwood had determined that it would be better for\\nmarianne to be any where at that time than at barton\\nwhere every thing within her view would be bringing back\\nthe past in the strongest and most afflicting manner\\nby constantly placing willoughby before her such as\\nshe had always seen him there  she recommended it to\\nher daughters therefore by all means not to shorten their\\nvisit to mrs jennings the length of which though never\\nexactly fixed had been expected by all to comprise at least\\nfive or six weeks  a variety of occupations of objects\\nand of company which could not be procured at barton\\nwould be inevitable there and might yet she hoped\\ncheat marianne at times into some interest beyond herself\\nand even into some amusement much as the ideas of both\\nmight now be spurned by her\\n\\nfrom all danger of seeing willoughby again\\nher mother considered her to be at least equally safe\\nin town as in the country since his acquaintance must\\nnow be dropped by all who called themselves her friends\\ndesign could never bring them in each others way\\nnegligence could never leave them exposed to a surprise\\nand chance had less in its favour in the crowd of london\\nthan even in the retirement of barton where it might\\nforce him before her while paying that visit at allenham\\non his marriage which mrs dashwood from foreseeing at\\nfirst as a probable event had brought herself to expect\\nas a certain one\\n\\nshe had yet another reason for wishing her children\\nto remain where they were a letter from her soninlaw\\nhad told her that he and his wife were to be in town\\nbefore the middle of february and she judged it right\\nthat they should sometimes see their brother\\n\\nmarianne had promised to be guided by her mothers opinion\\nand she submitted to it therefore without opposition\\nthough it proved perfectly different from what she wished\\nand expected though she felt it to be entirely wrong\\nformed on mistaken grounds and that by requiring her\\nlonger continuance in london it deprived her of the only\\npossible alleviation of her wretchedness the personal\\nsympathy of her mother and doomed her to such society and\\nsuch scenes as must prevent her ever knowing a moments rest\\n\\nbut it was a matter of great consolation to her\\nthat what brought evil to herself would bring good to\\nher sister and elinor on the other hand suspecting that\\nit would not be in her power to avoid edward entirely\\ncomforted herself by thinking that though their longer\\nstay would therefore militate against her own happiness\\nit would be better for marianne than an immediate return\\ninto devonshire\\n\\nher carefulness in guarding her sister from ever\\nhearing willoughbys name mentioned was not thrown away\\nmarianne though without knowing it herself reaped all\\nits advantage for neither mrs jennings nor sir john\\nnor even mrs palmer herself ever spoke of him before her\\nelinor wished that the same forbearance could have extended\\ntowards herself but that was impossible and she was\\nobliged to listen day after day to the indignation of them all\\n\\nsir john could not have thought it possible\\na man of whom he had always had such reason to think well\\nsuch a goodnatured fellow  he did not believe there was a\\nbolder rider in england  it was an unaccountable business\\nhe wished him at the devil with all his heart  he would\\nnot speak another word to him meet him where he might\\nfor all the world  no not if it were to be by the side\\nof barton covert and they were kept watching for two\\nhours together  such a scoundrel of a fellow such\\na deceitful dog  it was only the last time they met\\nthat he had offered him one of follys puppies and this\\nwas the end of it\\n\\nmrs palmer in her way was equally angry\\nshe was determined to drop his acquaintance immediately\\nand she was very thankful that she had never been acquainted\\nwith him at all  she wished with all her heart combe\\nmagna was not so near cleveland but it did not signify\\nfor it was a great deal too far off to visit she hated\\nhim so much that she was resolved never to mention\\nhis name again and she should tell everybody she saw\\nhow goodfornothing he was\\n\\nthe rest of mrs palmers sympathy was shewn in procuring\\nall the particulars in her power of the approaching marriage\\nand communicating them to elinor  she could soon tell\\nat what coachmakers the new carriage was building\\nby what painter mr willoughbys portrait was drawn\\nand at what warehouse miss greys clothes might be seen\\n\\nthe calm and polite unconcern of lady middleton\\non the occasion was a happy relief to elinors spirits\\noppressed as they often were by the clamorous kindness\\nof the others  it was a great comfort to her to be sure\\nof exciting no interest in one person at least among their\\ncircle of friends a great comfort to know that there\\nwas one who would meet her without feeling any curiosity\\nafter particulars or any anxiety for her sisters health\\n\\nevery qualification is raised at times by the\\ncircumstances of the moment to more than its real value\\nand she was sometimes worried down by officious condolence\\nto rate goodbreeding as more indispensable to comfort\\nthan goodnature\\n\\nlady middleton expressed her sense of the affair\\nabout once every day or twice if the subject occurred\\nvery often by saying it is very shocking indeed\\nand by the means of this continual though gentle vent\\nwas able not only to see the miss dashwoods from the\\nfirst without the smallest emotion but very soon\\nto see them without recollecting a word of the matter\\nand having thus supported the dignity of her own sex\\nand spoken her decided censure of what was wrong\\nin the other she thought herself at liberty to attend\\nto the interest of her own assemblies and therefore\\ndetermined though rather against the opinion of sir john\\nthat as mrs willoughby would at once be a woman of elegance\\nand fortune to leave her card with her as soon as she married\\n\\ncolonel brandons delicate unobtrusive enquiries\\nwere never unwelcome to miss dashwood  he had abundantly\\nearned the privilege of intimate discussion of her\\nsisters disappointment by the friendly zeal with\\nwhich he had endeavoured to soften it and they always\\nconversed with confidence  his chief reward for the\\npainful exertion of disclosing past sorrows and present\\nhumiliations was given in the pitying eye with which\\nmarianne sometimes observed him and the gentleness\\nof her voice whenever though it did not often happen\\nshe was obliged or could oblige herself to speak to him\\nthese assured him that his exertion had produced an\\nincrease of goodwill towards himself and these gave\\nelinor hopes of its being farther augmented hereafter\\nbut mrs jennings who knew nothing of all this who knew\\nonly that the colonel continued as grave as ever and that\\nshe could neither prevail on him to make the offer himself\\nnor commission her to make it for him began at the\\nend of two days to think that instead of midsummer\\nthey would not be married till michaelmas and by the\\nend of a week that it would not be a match at all\\nthe good understanding between the colonel and miss\\ndashwood seemed rather to declare that the honours\\nof the mulberrytree the canal and the yew arbour\\nwould all be made over to her and mrs jennings had\\nfor some time ceased to think at all of mrs ferrars\\n\\nearly in february within a fortnight from the\\nreceipt of willoughbys letter elinor had the painful\\noffice of informing her sister that he was married\\nshe had taken care to have the intelligence conveyed\\nto herself as soon as it was known that the ceremony\\nwas over as she was desirous that marianne should not\\nreceive the first notice of it from the public papers\\nwhich she saw her eagerly examining every morning\\n\\nshe received the news with resolute composure\\nmade no observation on it and at first shed no tears\\nbut after a short time they would burst out and for the\\nrest of the day she was in a state hardly less pitiable\\nthan when she first learnt to expect the event\\n\\nthe willoughbys left town as soon as they were married\\nand elinor now hoped as there could be no danger\\nof her seeing either of them to prevail on her sister\\nwho had never yet left the house since the blow first fell\\nto go out again by degrees as she had done before\\n\\nabout this time the two miss steeles lately arrived\\nat their cousins house in bartletts buildings\\nholburn presented themselves again before their more\\ngrand relations in conduit and berkeley streets\\nand were welcomed by them all with great cordiality\\n\\nelinor only was sorry to see them  their presence\\nalways gave her pain and she hardly knew how to make\\na very gracious return to the overpowering delight of lucy\\nin finding her still in town\\n\\ni should have been quite disappointed if i had not\\nfound you here still said she repeatedly with a strong\\nemphasis on the word  but i always thought i should\\ni was almost sure you would not leave london yet awhile\\nthough you told me you know at barton that you should\\nnot stay above a month  but i thought at the time\\nthat you would most likely change your mind when it came\\nto the point  it would have been such a great pity\\nto have went away before your brother and sister came\\nand now to be sure you will be in no hurry to be gone\\ni am amazingly glad you did not keep to your word\\n\\nelinor perfectly understood her and was forced\\nto use all her selfcommand to make it appear that she\\ndid not\\n\\nwell my dear said mrs jennings and how did\\nyou travel\\n\\nnot in the stage i assure you replied miss steele\\nwith quick exultation we came post all the way and had\\na very smart beau to attend us  dr davies was coming\\nto town and so we thought wed join him in a postchaise\\nand he behaved very genteelly and paid ten or twelve\\nshillings more than we did\\n\\noh oh cried mrs jennings very pretty\\nindeed and the doctor is a single man i warrant you\\n\\nthere now said miss steele affectedly simpering\\neverybody laughs at me so about the doctor and i\\ncannot think why  my cousins say they are sure i have\\nmade a conquest but for my part i declare i never think\\nabout him from one hours end to another  lord here\\ncomes your beau nancy my cousin said tother day\\nwhen she saw him crossing the street to the house\\nmy beau indeed said ii cannot think who you mean\\nthe doctor is no beau of mine\\n\\naye aye that is very pretty talkingbut it wont do\\nthe doctor is the man i see\\n\\nno indeed replied her cousin with affected earnestness\\nand i beg you will contradict it if you ever hear it talked\\nof\\n\\nmrs jennings directly gave her the gratifying\\nassurance that she certainly would not and miss steele\\nwas made completely happy\\n\\ni suppose you will go and stay with your brother\\nand sister miss dashwood when they come to town\\nsaid lucy returning after a cessation of hostile hints\\nto the charge\\n\\nno i do not think we shall\\n\\noh yes i dare say you will\\n\\nelinor would not humour her by farther opposition\\n\\nwhat a charming thing it is that mrs dashwood can\\nspare you both for so long a time together\\n\\nlong a time indeed interposed mrs jennings\\nwhy their visit is but just begun\\n\\nlucy was silenced\\n\\ni am sorry we cannot see your sister miss dashwood\\nsaid miss steele  i am sorry she is not well\\nfor marianne had left the room on their arrival\\n\\nyou are very good  my sister will be equally\\nsorry to miss the pleasure of seeing you but she has\\nbeen very much plagued lately with nervous headaches\\nwhich make her unfit for company or conversation\\n\\noh dear that is a great pity but such old\\nfriends as lucy and mei think she might see us\\nand i am sure we would not speak a word\\n\\nelinor with great civility declined the proposal\\nher sister was perhaps laid down upon the bed or in her\\ndressing gown and therefore not able to come to them\\n\\noh if thats all cried miss steele we can\\njust as well go and see her\\n\\nelinor began to find this impertinence too much for\\nher temper but she was saved the trouble of checking it\\nby lucys sharp reprimand which now as on many occasions\\nthough it did not give much sweetness to the manners\\nof one sister was of advantage in governing those of\\nthe other\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 33\\n\\n\\nafter some opposition marianne yielded to her\\nsisters entreaties and consented to go out with her\\nand mrs jennings one morning for half an hour she\\nexpressly conditioned however for paying no visits\\nand would do no more than accompany them to grays in\\nsackville street where elinor was carrying on a negotiation\\nfor the exchange of a few oldfashioned jewels of her mother\\n\\nwhen they stopped at the door mrs jennings recollected\\nthat there was a lady at the other end of the street\\non whom she ought to call and as she had no business\\nat grays it was resolved that while her young friends\\ntransacted theirs she should pay her visit and\\nreturn for them\\n\\non ascending the stairs the miss dashwoods found\\nso many people before them in the room that there was\\nnot a person at liberty to tend to their orders and they\\nwere obliged to wait  all that could be done was to sit\\ndown at that end of the counter which seemed to promise the\\nquickest succession one gentleman only was standing there\\nand it is probable that elinor was not without hope\\nof exciting his politeness to a quicker despatch\\nbut the correctness of his eye and the delicacy\\nof his taste proved to be beyond his politeness\\nhe was giving orders for a toothpickcase for himself\\nand till its size shape and ornaments were determined\\nall of which after examining and debating for a quarter\\nof an hour over every toothpickcase in the shop\\nwere finally arranged by his own inventive fancy he had\\nno leisure to bestow any other attention on the two ladies\\nthan what was comprised in three or four very broad stares\\na kind of notice which served to imprint on elinor\\nthe remembrance of a person and face of strong\\nnatural sterling insignificance though adorned in\\nthe first style of fashion\\n\\nmarianne was spared from the troublesome feelings\\nof contempt and resentment on this impertinent examination\\nof their features and on the puppyism of his manner\\nin deciding on all the different horrors of the different\\ntoothpickcases presented to his inspection by remaining\\nunconscious of it all for she was as well able to collect\\nher thoughts within herself and be as ignorant of what was\\npassing around her in mr grays shop as in her own bedroom\\n\\nat last the affair was decided  the ivory\\nthe gold and the pearls all received their appointment\\nand the gentleman having named the last day on which his\\nexistence could be continued without the possession of the\\ntoothpickcase drew on his gloves with leisurely care\\nand bestowing another glance on the miss dashwoods but such\\na one as seemed rather to demand than express admiration\\nwalked off with a happy air of real conceit and affected\\nindifference\\n\\nelinor lost no time in bringing her business forward\\nwas on the point of concluding it when another gentleman\\npresented himself at her side  she turned her eyes towards\\nhis face and found him with some surprise to be her brother\\n\\ntheir affection and pleasure in meeting was just enough\\nto make a very creditable appearance in mr grays shop\\njohn dashwood was really far from being sorry to see\\nhis sisters again it rather gave them satisfaction\\nand his inquiries after their mother were respectful\\nand attentive\\n\\nelinor found that he and fanny had been in town\\ntwo days\\n\\ni wished very much to call upon you yesterday\\nsaid he but it was impossible for we were obliged\\nto take harry to see the wild beasts at exeter exchange\\nand we spent the rest of the day with mrs ferrars\\nharry was vastly pleased  this morning i had fully intended\\nto call on you if i could possibly find a spare half hour\\nbut one has always so much to do on first coming to town\\ni am come here to bespeak fanny a seal  but tomorrow i\\nthink i shall certainly be able to call in berkeley street\\nand be introduced to your friend mrs jennings\\ni understand she is a woman of very good fortune\\nand the middletons too you must introduce me to them\\nas my motherinlaws relations i shall be happy to show\\nthem every respect  they are excellent neighbours to you in\\nthe country i understand\\n\\nexcellent indeed  their attention to our comfort\\ntheir friendliness in every particular is more than i\\ncan express\\n\\ni am extremely glad to hear it upon my word\\nextremely glad indeed  but so it ought to be they are\\npeople of large fortune they are related to you and\\nevery civility and accommodation that can serve to make\\nyour situation pleasant might be reasonably expected\\nand so you are most comfortably settled in your little cottage\\nand want for nothing  edward brought us a most charming\\naccount of the place the most complete thing of its kind\\nhe said that ever was and you all seemed to enjoy it beyond\\nany thing  it was a great satisfaction to us to hear it\\ni assure you\\n\\nelinor did feel a little ashamed of her brother\\nand was not sorry to be spared the necessity of answering him\\nby the arrival of mrs jenningss servant who came to tell\\nher that his mistress waited for them at the door\\n\\nmr dashwood attended them down stairs was introduced\\nto mrs jennings at the door of her carriage and repeating\\nhis hope of being able to call on them the next day\\ntook leave\\n\\nhis visit was duly paid  he came with a pretence at\\nan apology from their sisterinlaw for not coming too\\nbut she was so much engaged with her mother that really\\nshe had no leisure for going any where  mrs jennings\\nhowever assured him directly that she should not stand\\nupon ceremony for they were all cousins or something\\nlike it and she should certainly wait on mrs john\\ndashwood very soon and bring her sisters to see her\\nhis manners to them though calm were perfectly kind\\nto mrs jennings most attentively civil and on colonel\\nbrandons coming in soon after himself he eyed him with a\\ncuriosity which seemed to say that he only wanted to know\\nhim to be rich to be equally civil to him\\n\\nafter staying with them half an hour he asked\\nelinor to walk with him to conduit street and introduce\\nhim to sir john and lady middleton  the weather was\\nremarkably fine and she readily consented  as soon\\nas they were out of the house his enquiries began\\n\\nwho is colonel brandon  is he a man of fortune\\n\\nyes he has very good property in dorsetshire\\n\\ni am glad of it  he seems a most gentlemanlike man\\nand i think elinor i may congratulate you on the prospect\\nof a very respectable establishment in life\\n\\nme brother what do you mean\\n\\nhe likes you  i observed him narrowly and am\\nconvinced of it  what is the amount of his fortune\\n\\ni believe about two thousand a year\\n\\ntwo thousand ayear and then working himself\\nup to a pitch of enthusiastic generosity he added\\nelinor i wish with all my heart it were twice as much\\nfor your sake\\n\\nindeed i believe you replied elinor but i am\\nvery sure that colonel brandon has not the smallest wish\\nof marrying me\\n\\nyou are mistaken elinor you are very much mistaken\\na very little trouble on your side secures him\\nperhaps just at present he may be undecided the smallness\\nof your fortune may make him hang back his friends\\nmay all advise him against it  but some of those little\\nattentions and encouragements which ladies can so easily\\ngive will fix him in spite of himself  and there can be\\nno reason why you should not try for him  it is not to be\\nsupposed that any prior attachment on your sidein short\\nyou know as to an attachment of that kind it is quite\\nout of the question the objections are insurmountable\\nyou have too much sense not to see all that  colonel brandon\\nmust be the man and no civility shall be wanting on\\nmy part to make him pleased with you and your family\\nit is a match that must give universal satisfaction\\nin short it is a kind of thing thatlowering his voice\\nto an important whisperwill be exceedingly welcome\\nto all parties recollecting himself however he added\\nthat is i mean to sayyour friends are all truly\\nanxious to see you well settled fanny particularly\\nfor she has your interest very much at heart i assure you\\nand her mother too mrs ferrars a very goodnatured woman\\ni am sure it would give her great pleasure she said as much\\nthe other day\\n\\nelinor would not vouchsafe any answer\\n\\nit would be something remarkable now he continued\\nsomething droll if fanny should have a brother and i\\na sister settling at the same time  and yet it is not\\nvery unlikely\\n\\nis mr edward ferrars said elinor with resolution\\ngoing to be married\\n\\nit is not actually settled but there is such\\na thing in agitation  he has a most excellent mother\\nmrs ferrars with the utmost liberality will come forward\\nand settle on him a thousand a year if the match\\ntakes place  the lady is the hon miss morton only daughter\\nof the late lord morton with thirty thousand pounds\\na very desirable connection on both sides and i have not\\na doubt of its taking place in time  a thousand ayear\\nis a great deal for a mother to give away to make over\\nfor ever but mrs ferrars has a noble spirit  to give\\nyou another instance of her liberalitythe other day\\nas soon as we came to town aware that money could\\nnot be very plenty with us just now she put banknotes\\ninto fannys hands to the amount of two hundred pounds\\nand extremely acceptable it is for we must live at a great\\nexpense while we are here\\n\\nhe paused for her assent and compassion and she\\nforced herself to say\\n\\nyour expenses both in town and country must certainly\\nbe considerable but your income is a large one\\n\\nnot so large i dare say as many people suppose\\ni do not mean to complain however it is undoubtedly\\na comfortable one and i hope will in time be better\\nthe enclosure of norland common now carrying on\\nis a most serious drain  and then i have made a little\\npurchase within this half year east kingham farm\\nyou must remember the place where old gibson used to live\\nthe land was so very desirable for me in every respect\\nso immediately adjoining my own property that i felt it\\nmy duty to buy it  i could not have answered it to my\\nconscience to let it fall into any other hands  a man must\\npay for his convenience and it has cost me a vast deal\\nof money\\n\\nmore than you think it really and intrinsically worth\\n\\nwhy i hope not that  i might have sold it again\\nthe next day for more than i gave but with regard to the\\npurchasemoney i might have been very unfortunate indeed\\nfor the stocks were at that time so low that if i had not\\nhappened to have the necessary sum in my bankers hands\\ni must have sold out to very great loss\\n\\nelinor could only smile\\n\\nother great and inevitable expenses too we have\\nhad on first coming to norland  our respected father\\nas you well know bequeathed all the stanhill effects\\nthat remained at norland and very valuable they were\\nto your mother  far be it from me to repine at his\\ndoing so he had an undoubted right to dispose of his\\nown property as he chose but in consequence of it\\nwe have been obliged to make large purchases of linen\\nchina c to supply the place of what was taken away\\nyou may guess after all these expenses how very far we\\nmust be from being rich and how acceptable mrs ferrarss\\nkindness is\\n\\ncertainly said elinor and assisted by her liberality\\ni hope you may yet live to be in easy circumstances\\n\\nanother year or two may do much towards it\\nhe gravely replied but however there is still a great\\ndeal to be done  there is not a stone laid of fannys\\ngreenhouse and nothing but the plan of the flowergarden\\nmarked out\\n\\nwhere is the greenhouse to be\\n\\nupon the knoll behind the house  the old\\nwalnut trees are all come down to make room for it\\nit will be a very fine object from many parts of the park\\nand the flowergarden will slope down just before it\\nand be exceedingly pretty  we have cleared away all the old\\nthorns that grew in patches over the brow\\n\\nelinor kept her concern and her censure to herself\\nand was very thankful that marianne was not present\\nto share the provocation\\n\\nhaving now said enough to make his poverty clear\\nand to do away the necessity of buying a pair of earrings\\nfor each of his sisters in his next visit at grays\\nhis thoughts took a cheerfuller turn and he began to\\ncongratulate elinor on having such a friend as mrs jennings\\n\\nshe seems a most valuable woman indeedher house\\nher style of living all bespeak an exceeding good income\\nand it is an acquaintance that has not only been\\nof great use to you hitherto but in the end may prove\\nmaterially advantageousher inviting you to town is\\ncertainly a vast thing in your favour and indeed it\\nspeaks altogether so great a regard for you that in all\\nprobability when she dies you will not be forgotten\\nshe must have a great deal to leave\\n\\nnothing at all i should rather suppose for she has\\nonly her jointure which will descend to her children\\n\\nbut it is not to be imagined that she lives up to\\nher income  few people of common prudence will do that\\nand whatever she saves she will be able to dispose of\\n\\nand do you not think it more likely that she\\nshould leave it to her daughters than to us\\n\\nher daughters are both exceedingly well married\\nand therefore i cannot perceive the necessity of her\\nremembering them farther  whereas in my opinion by her\\ntaking so much notice of you and treating you in this\\nkind of way she has given you a sort of claim on her\\nfuture consideration which a conscientious woman would\\nnot disregard  nothing can be kinder than her behaviour\\nand she can hardly do all this without being aware\\nof the expectation it raises\\n\\nbut she raises none in those most concerned\\nindeed brother your anxiety for our welfare and prosperity\\ncarries you too far\\n\\nwhy to be sure said he seeming to recollect himself\\npeople have little have very little in their power\\nbut my dear elinor what is the matter with marianne\\nshe looks very unwell has lost her colour and is grown\\nquite thin  is she ill\\n\\nshe is not well she has had a nervous complaint\\non her for several weeks\\n\\ni am sorry for that  at her time of life\\nany thing of an illness destroys the bloom for ever\\nhers has been a very short one  she was as handsome a girl\\nlast september as i ever saw and as likely to attract\\nthe man  there was something in her style of beauty\\nto please them particularly  i remember fanny used to say\\nthat she would marry sooner and better than you did\\nnot but what she is exceedingly fond of you but so it\\nhappened to strike her  she will be mistaken however\\ni question whether marianne now will marry a man worth\\nmore than five or six hundred ayear at the utmost\\nand i am very much deceived if you do not do better\\ndorsetshire  i know very little of dorsetshire but my dear\\nelinor i shall be exceedingly glad to know more of it\\nand i think i can answer for your having fanny and myself\\namong the earliest and best pleased of your visitors\\n\\nelinor tried very seriously to convince him that\\nthere was no likelihood of her marrying colonel brandon\\nbut it was an expectation of too much pleasure to himself\\nto be relinquished and he was really resolved on seeking\\nan intimacy with that gentleman and promoting the marriage\\nby every possible attention  he had just compunction\\nenough for having done nothing for his sisters himself\\nto be exceedingly anxious that everybody else should\\ndo a great deal and an offer from colonel brandon\\nor a legacy from mrs jennings was the easiest means\\nof atoning for his own neglect\\n\\nthey were lucky enough to find lady middleton\\nat home and sir john came in before their visit ended\\nabundance of civilities passed on all sides  sir john\\nwas ready to like anybody and though mr dashwood did\\nnot seem to know much about horses he soon set him\\ndown as a very goodnatured fellow while lady middleton\\nsaw enough of fashion in his appearance to think his\\nacquaintance worth having and mr dashwood went away\\ndelighted with both\\n\\ni shall have a charming account to carry\\nto fanny said he as he walked back with his sister\\nlady middleton is really a most elegant woman  such\\na woman as i am sure fanny will be glad to know\\nand mrs jennings too an exceedingly wellbehaved woman\\nthough not so elegant as her daughter  your sister need\\nnot have any scruple even of visiting her which to say\\nthe truth has been a little the case and very naturally\\nfor we only knew that mrs jennings was the widow of a man\\nwho had got all his money in a low way and fanny and\\nmrs ferrars were both strongly prepossessed that neither\\nshe nor her daughters were such kind of women as fanny\\nwould like to associate with  but now i can carry her\\na most satisfactory account of both\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 34\\n\\n\\nmrs john dashwood had so much confidence in her\\nhusbands judgment that she waited the very next day\\nboth on mrs jennings and her daughter and her\\nconfidence was rewarded by finding even the former\\neven the woman with whom her sisters were staying\\nby no means unworthy her notice and as for lady middleton\\nshe found her one of the most charming women in the world\\n\\nlady middleton was equally pleased with mrs dashwood\\nthere was a kind of cold hearted selfishness on both sides\\nwhich mutually attracted them and they sympathised\\nwith each other in an insipid propriety of demeanor\\nand a general want of understanding\\n\\nthe same manners however which recommended mrs john\\ndashwood to the good opinion of lady middleton did not suit\\nthe fancy of mrs jennings and to her she appeared nothing\\nmore than a little proudlooking woman of uncordial address\\nwho met her husbands sisters without any affection\\nand almost without having anything to say to them\\nfor of the quarter of an hour bestowed on berkeley street\\nshe sat at least seven minutes and a half in silence\\n\\nelinor wanted very much to know though she did\\nnot chuse to ask whether edward was then in town\\nbut nothing would have induced fanny voluntarily\\nto mention his name before her till able to tell her\\nthat his marriage with miss morton was resolved on\\nor till her husbands expectations on colonel brandon\\nwere answered because she believed them still so very\\nmuch attached to each other that they could not be too\\nsedulously divided in word and deed on every occasion\\nthe intelligence however which she would not give\\nsoon flowed from another quarter  lucy came very shortly\\nto claim elinors compassion on being unable to see edward\\nthough he had arrived in town with mr and mrs dashwood\\nhe dared not come to bartletts buildings for fear\\nof detection and though their mutual impatience to meet\\nwas not to be told they could do nothing at present\\nbut write\\n\\nedward assured them himself of his being in town\\nwithin a very short time by twice calling in berkeley street\\ntwice was his card found on the table when they returned\\nfrom their mornings engagements  elinor was pleased\\nthat he had called and still more pleased that she had\\nmissed him\\n\\nthe dashwoods were so prodigiously delighted\\nwith the middletons that though not much in the habit\\nof giving anything they determined to give them\\na dinner and soon after their acquaintance began\\ninvited them to dine in harley street where they had\\ntaken a very good house for three months  their sisters\\nand mrs jennings were invited likewise and john dashwood\\nwas careful to secure colonel brandon who always glad\\nto be where the miss dashwoods were received his eager\\ncivilities with some surprise but much more pleasure\\nthey were to meet mrs ferrars but elinor could not learn\\nwhether her sons were to be of the party  the expectation\\nof seeing her however was enough to make her interested\\nin the engagement for though she could now meet edwards\\nmother without that strong anxiety which had once promised\\nto attend such an introduction though she could now see\\nher with perfect indifference as to her opinion of herself\\nher desire of being in company with mrs ferrars\\nher curiosity to know what she was like was as lively as ever\\n\\nthe interest with which she thus anticipated the\\nparty was soon afterwards increased more powerfully\\nthan pleasantly by her hearing that the miss steeles\\nwere also to be at it\\n\\nso well had they recommended themselves to lady middleton\\nso agreeable had their assiduities made them to her\\nthat though lucy was certainly not so elegant and her\\nsister not even genteel she was as ready as sir john\\nto ask them to spend a week or two in conduit street\\nand it happened to be particularly convenient to the miss\\nsteeles as soon as the dashwoods invitation was known\\nthat their visit should begin a few days before the party\\ntook place\\n\\ntheir claims to the notice of mrs john dashwood\\nas the nieces of the gentleman who for many years had\\nhad the care of her brother might not have done much\\nhowever towards procuring them seats at her table\\nbut as lady middletons guests they must be welcome and lucy\\nwho had long wanted to be personally known to the family\\nto have a nearer view of their characters and her own\\ndifficulties and to have an opportunity of endeavouring\\nto please them had seldom been happier in her life\\nthan she was on receiving mrs john dashwoods card\\n\\non elinor its effect was very different  she began\\nimmediately to determine that edward who lived with\\nhis mother must be asked as his mother was to a party\\ngiven by his sister and to see him for the first time\\nafter all that passed in the company of lucyshe hardly\\nknew how she could bear it\\n\\nthese apprehensions perhaps were not founded\\nentirely on reason and certainly not at all on truth\\nthey were relieved however not by her own recollection\\nbut by the good will of lucy who believed herself to be\\ninflicting a severe disappointment when she told her\\nthat edward certainly would not be in harley street on tuesday\\nand even hoped to be carrying the pain still farther\\nby persuading her that he was kept away by the extreme\\naffection for herself which he could not conceal when they\\nwere together\\n\\nthe important tuesday came that was to introduce\\nthe two young ladies to this formidable motherinlaw\\n\\npity me dear miss dashwood said lucy as they\\nwalked up the stairs togetherfor the middletons arrived\\nso directly after mrs jennings that they all followed\\nthe servant at the same timethere is nobody here but\\nyou that can feel for mei declare i can hardly stand\\ngood graciousin a moment i shall see the person that all\\nmy happiness depends onthat is to be my mother\\n\\nelinor could have given her immediate relief\\nby suggesting the possibility of its being miss mortons mother\\nrather than her own whom they were about to behold\\nbut instead of doing that she assured her and with\\ngreat sincerity that she did pity herto the utter\\namazement of lucy who though really uncomfortable herself\\nhoped at least to be an object of irrepressible envy to elinor\\n\\nmrs ferrars was a little thin woman upright\\neven to formality in her figure and serious\\neven to sourness in her aspect  her complexion was sallow\\nand her features small without beauty and naturally\\nwithout expression but a lucky contraction of the brow\\nhad rescued her countenance from the disgrace of insipidity\\nby giving it the strong characters of pride and ill nature\\nshe was not a woman of many words for unlike people\\nin general she proportioned them to the number of\\nher ideas and of the few syllables that did escape her\\nnot one fell to the share of miss dashwood whom she eyed\\nwith the spirited determination of disliking her at all events\\n\\nelinor could not now be made unhappy by this behaviour\\na few months ago it would have hurt her exceedingly but it\\nwas not in mrs ferrars power to distress her by it now\\nand the difference of her manners to the miss steeles\\na difference which seemed purposely made to humble her more\\nonly amused her  she could not but smile to see the graciousness\\nof both mother and daughter towards the very person\\nfor lucy was particularly distinguishedwhom of all others\\nhad they known as much as she did they would have been most\\nanxious to mortify while she herself who had comparatively\\nno power to wound them sat pointedly slighted by both\\nbut while she smiled at a graciousness so misapplied\\nshe could not reflect on the meanspirited folly from\\nwhich it sprung nor observe the studied attentions\\nwith which the miss steeles courted its continuance\\nwithout thoroughly despising them all four\\n\\nlucy was all exultation on being so honorably\\ndistinguished and miss steele wanted only to be teazed\\nabout dr davies to be perfectly happy\\n\\nthe dinner was a grand one the servants were numerous\\nand every thing bespoke the mistresss inclination\\nfor show and the masters ability to support it\\nin spite of the improvements and additions which were\\nmaking to the norland estate and in spite of its owner\\nhaving once been within some thousand pounds of being\\nobliged to sell out at a loss nothing gave any symptom\\nof that indigence which he had tried to infer from it\\nno poverty of any kind except of conversation appeared\\nbut there the deficiency was considerable  john dashwood\\nhad not much to say for himself that was worth hearing\\nand his wife had still less  but there was no peculiar\\ndisgrace in this for it was very much the case with\\nthe chief of their visitors who almost all laboured\\nunder one or other of these disqualifications for being\\nagreeablewant of sense either natural or improvedwant\\nof elegancewant of spiritsor want of temper\\n\\nwhen the ladies withdrew to the drawingroom\\nafter dinner this poverty was particularly evident\\nfor the gentlemen had supplied the discourse with some\\nvarietythe variety of politics inclosing land\\nand breaking horsesbut then it was all over and one\\nsubject only engaged the ladies till coffee came in\\nwhich was the comparative heights of harry dashwood\\nand lady middletons second son william who were nearly\\nof the same age\\n\\nhad both the children been there the affair might\\nhave been determined too easily by measuring them at once\\nbut as harry only was present it was all conjectural\\nassertion on both sides and every body had a right to\\nbe equally positive in their opinion and to repeat it\\nover and over again as often as they liked\\n\\nthe parties stood thus\\n\\nthe two mothers though each really convinced that\\nher own son was the tallest politely decided in favour\\nof the other\\n\\nthe two grandmothers with not less partiality\\nbut more sincerity were equally earnest in support\\nof their own descendant\\n\\nlucy who was hardly less anxious to please one parent\\nthan the other thought the boys were both remarkably tall\\nfor their age and could not conceive that there could\\nbe the smallest difference in the world between them\\nand miss steele with yet greater address gave it\\nas fast as she could in favour of each\\n\\nelinor having once delivered her opinion on\\nwilliams side by which she offended mrs ferrars and\\nfanny still more did not see the necessity of enforcing\\nit by any farther assertion and marianne when called\\non for hers offended them all by declaring that she\\nhad no opinion to give as she had never thought about it\\n\\nbefore her removing from norland elinor had painted\\na very pretty pair of screens for her sisterinlaw\\nwhich being now just mounted and brought home\\nornamented her present drawing room

my eldest sister said he and you\\nas a man of taste will i dare say be pleased with them\\ni do not know whether you have ever happened to see any\\nof her performances before but she is in general reckoned\\nto draw extremely well\\n\\nthe colonel though disclaiming all pretensions\\nto connoisseurship warmly admired the screens as he\\nwould have done any thing painted by miss dashwood\\nand on the curiosity of the others being of course excited\\nthey were handed round for general inspection\\nmrs ferrars not aware of their being elinors work\\nparticularly requested to look at them and after they had\\nreceived gratifying testimony of lady middletonss approbation\\nfanny presented them to her mother considerately informing\\nher at the same time that they were done by miss dashwood\\n\\nhumsaid mrs ferrarsvery prettyand without\\nregarding them at all returned them to her daughter\\n\\nperhaps fanny thought for a moment that her mother\\nhad been quite rude enoughfor colouring a little\\nshe immediately said\\n\\nthey are very pretty maamant they but then again\\nthe dread of having been too civil too encouraging herself\\nprobably came over her for she presently added\\n\\ndo you not think they are something in miss\\nmortons style of painting maamshe does paint most\\ndelightfullyhow beautifully her last landscape is done\\n\\nbeautifully indeed  but she does every thing well\\n\\nmarianne could not bear thisshe was already\\ngreatly displeased with mrs ferrars and such illtimed\\npraise of another at elinors expense though she\\nhad not any notion of what was principally meant by it\\nprovoked her immediately to say with warmth\\n\\nthis is admiration of a very particular kind\\nwhat is miss morton to uswho knows or who cares\\nfor herit is elinor of whom we think and speak\\n\\nand so saying she took the screens out of her\\nsisterinlaws hands to admire them herself as they\\nought to be admired\\n\\nmrs ferrars looked exceedingly angry and drawing\\nherself up more stiffly than ever pronounced in retort\\nthis bitter philippic miss morton is lord mortons daughter\\n\\nfanny looked very angry too and her husband was\\nall in a fright at his sisters audacity  elinor was\\nmuch more hurt by mariannes warmth than she had been\\nby what produced it but colonel brandons eyes as they\\nwere fixed on marianne declared that he noticed only\\nwhat was amiable in it the affectionate heart which could\\nnot bear to see a sister slighted in the smallest point\\n\\nmariannes feelings did not stop here  the cold\\ninsolence of mrs ferrarss general behaviour to her sister\\nseemed to her to foretell such difficulties and distresses\\nto elinor as her own wounded heart taught her to think\\nof with horror and urged by a strong impulse of\\naffectionate sensibility she moved after a moment\\nto her sisters chair and putting one arm round her neck\\nand one cheek close to hers said in a low but eager\\nvoice\\n\\ndear dear elinor dont mind them  dont let them\\nmake you unhappy\\n\\nshe could say no more her spirits were quite overcome\\nand hiding her face on elinors shoulder she burst\\ninto tears  every bodys attention was called and almost\\nevery body was concernedcolonel brandon rose up and went\\nto them without knowing what he didmrs jennings\\nwith a very intelligent ah poor dear immediately gave\\nher her salts and sir john felt so desperately enraged\\nagainst the author of this nervous distress that he\\ninstantly changed his seat to one close by lucy steele\\nand gave her in a whisper a brief account of the whole\\nshocking affair\\n\\nin a few minutes however marianne was recovered\\nenough to put an end to the bustle and sit down among\\nthe rest though her spirits retained the impression\\nof what had passed the whole evening\\n\\npoor marianne said her brother to colonel brandon\\nin a low voice as soon as he could secure his attention\\nshe has not such good health as her sistershe is very\\nnervousshe has not elinors constitutionand one must\\nallow that there is something very trying to a young woman\\nwho has been a beauty in the loss of her personal attractions\\nyou would not think it perhaps but marianne was remarkably\\nhandsome a few months ago quite as handsome as elinor\\nnow you see it is all gone\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 35\\n\\n\\nelinors curiosity to see mrs ferrars was satisfied\\nshe had found in her every thing that could tend to make\\na farther connection between the families undesirable\\nshe had seen enough of her pride her meanness and her\\ndetermined prejudice against herself to comprehend all\\nthe difficulties that must have perplexed the engagement\\nand retarded the marriage of edward and herself had he been\\notherwise freeand she had seen almost enough to be thankful\\nfor her own sake that one greater obstacle preserved her\\nfrom suffering under any other of mrs ferrarss creation\\npreserved her from all dependence upon her caprice or any\\nsolicitude for her good opinion  or at least if she did not\\nbring herself quite to rejoice in edwards being fettered\\nto lucy she determined that had lucy been more amiable\\nshe ought to have rejoiced\\n\\nshe wondered that lucys spirits could be so very much\\nelevated by the civility of mrs ferrarsthat her interest\\nand her vanity should so very much blind her as to make\\nthe attention which seemed only paid her because she was\\nnot elinor appear a compliment to herselfor to allow\\nher to derive encouragement from a preference only given her\\nbecause her real situation was unknown  but that it was so\\nhad not only been declared by lucys eyes at the time\\nbut was declared over again the next morning more openly\\nfor at her particular desire lady middleton set her down\\nin berkeley street on the chance of seeing elinor alone\\nto tell her how happy she was\\n\\nthe chance proved a lucky one for a message from\\nmrs palmer soon after she arrived carried mrs jennings away\\n\\nmy dear friend cried lucy as soon as they were\\nby themselves i come to talk to you of my happiness\\ncould anything be so flattering as mrs ferrarss way\\nof treating me yesterday  so exceeding affable as she\\nwasyou know how i dreaded the thoughts of seeing her\\nbut the very moment i was introduced there was such an\\naffability in her behaviour as really should seem to say\\nshe had quite took a fancy to me  now was not it so\\nyou saw it all and was not you quite struck with it\\n\\nshe was certainly very civil to you\\n\\ncivildid you see nothing but only civility\\ni saw a vast deal more  such kindness as fell to the share\\nof nobody but meno pride no hauteur and your sister\\njust the sameall sweetness and affability\\n\\nelinor wished to talk of something else but lucy still\\npressed her to own that she had reason for her happiness\\nand elinor was obliged to go on\\n\\nundoubtedly if they had known your engagement\\nsaid she nothing could be more flattering than their\\ntreatment of youbut as that was not the case\\n\\ni guessed you would say soreplied lucy\\nquicklybut there was no reason in the world why\\nmrs ferrars should seem to like me if she did not\\nand her liking me is every thing  you shant talk me\\nout of my satisfaction  i am sure it will all end well\\nand there will be no difficulties at all to what i\\nused to think  mrs ferrars is a charming woman\\nand so is your sister  they are both delightful women\\nindeedi wonder i should never hear you say how agreeable\\nmrs dashwood was\\n\\nto this elinor had no answer to make and did not\\nattempt any\\n\\nare you ill miss dashwoodyou seem lowyou\\ndont speaksure you ant well\\n\\ni never was in better health\\n\\ni am glad of it with all my heart but really you did\\nnot look it  i should be sorry to have you ill you that have\\nbeen the greatest comfort to me in the worldheaven\\nknows what i should have done without your friendship\\n\\nelinor tried to make a civil answer though doubting\\nher own success  but it seemed to satisfy lucy for she\\ndirectly replied\\n\\nindeed i am perfectly convinced of your regard\\nfor me and next to edwards love it is the greatest\\ncomfort i havepoor edwardbut now there is one\\ngood thing we shall be able to meet and meet pretty often\\nfor lady middletons delighted with mrs dashwood\\nso we shall be a good deal in harley street i dare say\\nand edward spends half his time with his sisterbesides\\nlady middleton and mrs ferrars will visit now\\nand mrs ferrars and your sister were both so good to say\\nmore than once they should always be glad to see me\\nthey are such charming womeni am sure if ever you\\ntell your sister what i think of her you cannot speak\\ntoo high\\n\\nbut elinor would not give her any encouragement\\nto hope that she should tell her sister  lucy continued\\n\\ni am sure i should have seen it in a moment\\nif mrs ferrars had took a dislike to me  if she had only\\nmade me a formal courtesy for instance without saying\\na word and never after had took any notice of me\\nand never looked at me in a pleasant wayyou know\\nwhat i meanif i had been treated in that forbidding\\nsort of way i should have gave it all up in despair\\ni could not have stood it  for where she does dislike\\ni know it is most violent\\n\\nelinor was prevented from making any reply to this\\ncivil triumph by the doors being thrown open the servants\\nannouncing mr ferrars and edwards immediately walking in\\n\\nit was a very awkward moment and the countenance of each\\nshewed that it was so  they all looked exceedingly foolish\\nand edward seemed to have as great an inclination to walk\\nout of the room again as to advance farther into it\\nthe very circumstance in its unpleasantest form\\nwhich they would each have been most anxious to avoid\\nhad fallen on themthey were not only all three together\\nbut were together without the relief of any other person\\nthe ladies recovered themselves first  it was not lucys\\nbusiness to put herself forward and the appearance of\\nsecrecy must still be kept up  she could therefore only\\nlook her tenderness and after slightly addressing him\\nsaid no more\\n\\nbut elinor had more to do and so anxious was she\\nfor his sake and her own to do it well that she\\nforced herself after a moments recollection\\nto welcome him with a look and manner that were almost easy\\nand almost open and another struggle another effort still\\nimproved them  she would not allow the presence of lucy\\nnor the consciousness of some injustice towards herself\\nto deter her from saying that she was happy to see him\\nand that she had very much regretted being from home\\nwhen he called before in berkeley street  she would\\nnot be frightened from paying him those attentions which\\nas a friend and almost a relation were his due by the\\nobservant eyes of lucy though she soon perceived them\\nto be narrowly watching her\\n\\nher manners gave some reassurance to edward and he\\nhad courage enough to sit down but his embarrassment still\\nexceeded that of the ladies in a proportion which the case\\nrendered reasonable though his sex might make it rare\\nfor his heart had not the indifference of lucys nor\\ncould his conscience have quite the ease of elinors\\n\\nlucy with a demure and settled air seemed determined\\nto make no contribution to the comfort of the others\\nand would not say a word and almost every thing that was\\nsaid proceeded from elinor who was obliged to volunteer\\nall the information about her mothers health their coming\\nto town c which edward ought to have inquired about\\nbut never did\\n\\nher exertions did not stop here for she soon\\nafterwards felt herself so heroically disposed as\\nto determine under pretence of fetching marianne\\nto leave the others by themselves and she really did it\\nand that in the handsomest manner for she loitered away\\nseveral minutes on the landingplace with the most\\nhighminded fortitude before she went to her sister\\nwhen that was once done however it was time for the raptures\\nof edward to cease for mariannes joy hurried her into\\nthe drawingroom immediately  her pleasure in seeing him\\nwas like every other of her feelings strong in itself\\nand strongly spoken  she met him with a hand that would\\nbe taken and a voice that expressed the affection of a sister\\n\\ndear edward she cried this is a moment of great\\nhappinessthis would almost make amends for every thing\\n\\nedward tried to return her kindness as it deserved\\nbut before such witnesses he dared not say half what he\\nreally felt  again they all sat down and for a moment\\nor two all were silent while marianne was looking with the\\nmost speaking tenderness sometimes at edward and sometimes\\nat elinor regretting only that their delight in each\\nother should be checked by lucys unwelcome presence\\nedward was the first to speak and it was to notice\\nmariannes altered looks and express his fear of her\\nnot finding london agree with her\\n\\noh dont think of me she replied with spirited\\nearnestness though her eyes were filled with tears\\nas she spoke dont think of my health  elinor is well\\nyou see  that must be enough for us both\\n\\nthis remark was not calculated to make edward or\\nelinor more easy nor to conciliate the good will of lucy\\nwho looked up at marianne with no very benignant expression\\n\\ndo you like london said edward willing to say\\nany thing that might introduce another subject\\n\\nnot at all  i expected much pleasure in it\\nbut i have found none  the sight of you edward is the\\nonly comfort it has afforded and thank heaven you\\nare what you always were\\n\\nshe pausedno one spoke\\n\\ni think elinor she presently added we must\\nemploy edward to take care of us in our return to barton\\nin a week or two i suppose we shall be going and i trust\\nedward will not be very unwilling to accept the charge\\n\\npoor edward muttered something but what it was\\nnobody knew not even himself  but marianne who saw\\nhis agitation and could easily trace it to whatever\\ncause best pleased herself was perfectly satisfied\\nand soon talked of something else\\n\\nwe spent such a day edward in harley street\\nyesterday  so dull so wretchedly dullbut i have much\\nto say to you on that head which cannot be said now\\n\\nand with this admirable discretion did she defer\\nthe assurance of her finding their mutual relatives more\\ndisagreeable than ever and of her being particularly\\ndisgusted with his mother till they were more in private\\n\\nbut why were you not there edwardwhy did you\\nnot come\\n\\ni was engaged elsewhere\\n\\nengaged  but what was that when such friends\\nwere to be met\\n\\nperhaps miss marianne cried lucy eager to take\\nsome revenge on her you think young men never stand\\nupon engagements if they have no mind to keep them\\nlittle as well as great\\n\\nelinor was very angry but marianne seemed entirely\\ninsensible of the sting for she calmly replied\\n\\nnot so indeed for seriously speaking i am very\\nsure that conscience only kept edward from harley street\\nand i really believe he has the most delicate conscience\\nin the world the most scrupulous in performing\\nevery engagement however minute and however it\\nmay make against his interest or pleasure  he is the\\nmost fearful of giving pain of wounding expectation\\nand the most incapable of being selfish of any body\\ni ever saw  edward it is so and i will say it\\nwhat are you never to hear yourself praisedthen you\\nmust be no friend of mine for those who will accept\\nof my love and esteem must submit to my open commendation\\n\\nthe nature of her commendation in the present case\\nhowever happened to be particularly illsuited to the\\nfeelings of two thirds of her auditors and was so very\\nunexhilarating to edward that he very soon got up to go away\\n\\ngoing so soon said marianne my dear edward\\nthis must not be\\n\\nand drawing him a little aside she whispered\\nher persuasion that lucy could not stay much longer\\nbut even this encouragement failed for he would go\\nand lucy who would have outstaid him had his visit lasted\\ntwo hours soon afterwards went away\\n\\nwhat can bring her here so often said marianne\\non her leaving them  could not she see that we wanted\\nher gonehow teazing to edward\\n\\nwhy sowe were all his friends and lucy has been\\nthe longest known to him of any  it is but natural\\nthat he should like to see her as well as ourselves\\n\\nmarianne looked at her steadily and said you know\\nelinor that this is a kind of talking which i cannot bear\\nif you only hope to have your assertion contradicted\\nas i must suppose to be the case you ought to recollect\\nthat i am the last person in the world to do it\\ni cannot descend to be tricked out of assurances that are\\nnot really wanted\\n\\nshe then left the room and elinor dared not follow\\nher to say more for bound as she was by her promise\\nof secrecy to lucy she could give no information that\\nwould convince marianne and painful as the consequences\\nof her still continuing in an error might be she was\\nobliged to submit to it  all that she could hope was\\nthat edward would not often expose her or himself to the\\ndistress of hearing mariannes mistaken warmth nor to the\\nrepetition of any other part of the pain that had attended\\ntheir recent meetingand this she had every reason to expect\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 36\\n\\n\\nwithin a few days after this meeting the newspapers\\nannounced to the world that the lady of thomas palmer\\nesq was safely delivered of a son and heir a very\\ninteresting and satisfactory paragraph at least to all\\nthose intimate connections who knew it before\\n\\nthis event highly important to mrs jenningss happiness\\nproduced a temporary alteration in the disposal of her time\\nand influenced in a like degree the engagements\\nof her young friends for as she wished to be as much\\nas possible with charlotte she went thither every morning\\nas soon as she was dressed and did not return till late\\nin the evening and the miss dashwoods at the particular\\nrequest of the middletons spent the whole of every day\\nin every day in conduit street  for their own comfort\\nthey would much rather have remained at least all\\nthe morning in mrs jenningss house but it was not\\na thing to be urged against the wishes of everybody\\ntheir hours were therefore made over to lady middleton\\nand the two miss steeles by whom their company in fact\\nwas as little valued as it was professedly sought\\n\\nthey had too much sense to be desirable companions\\nto the former and by the latter they were considered with\\na jealous eye as intruding on their ground and sharing\\nthe kindness which they wanted to monopolize  though nothing\\ncould be more polite than lady middletons behaviour to\\nelinor and marianne she did not really like them at all\\nbecause they neither flattered herself nor her children\\nshe could not believe them goodnatured and because they\\nwere fond of reading she fancied them satirical perhaps\\nwithout exactly knowing what it was to be satirical\\nbut that did not signify  it was censure in common use\\nand easily given\\n\\ntheir presence was a restraint both on her and on lucy\\nit checked the idleness of one and the business of the other\\nlady middleton was ashamed of doing nothing before them\\nand the flattery which lucy was proud to think of\\nand administer at other times she feared they would despise\\nher for offering  miss steele was the least discomposed\\nof the three by their presence and it was in their power\\nto reconcile her to it entirely  would either of them\\nonly have given her a full and minute account of the whole\\naffair between marianne and mr willoughby she would\\nhave thought herself amply rewarded for the sacrifice\\nof the best place by the fire after dinner which their\\narrival occasioned  but this conciliation was not granted\\nfor though she often threw out expressions of pity for her\\nsister to elinor and more than once dropt a reflection\\non the inconstancy of beaux before marianne no effect\\nwas produced but a look of indifference from the former\\nor of disgust in the latter  an effort even yet lighter\\nmight have made her their friend  would they only have\\nlaughed at her about the doctor  but so little were they\\nanymore than the others inclined to oblige her\\nthat if sir john dined from home she might spend a whole\\nday without hearing any other raillery on the subject\\nthan what she was kind enough to bestow on herself\\n\\nall these jealousies and discontents however were so\\ntotally unsuspected by mrs jennings that she thought\\nit a delightful thing for the girls to be together\\nand generally congratulated her young friends every night\\non having escaped the company of a stupid old woman so long\\nshe joined them sometimes at sir johns sometimes\\nat her own house but wherever it was she always came\\nin excellent spirits full of delight and importance\\nattributing charlottes well doing to her own care and ready\\nto give so exact so minute a detail of her situation\\nas only miss steele had curiosity enough to desire\\none thing did disturb her and of that she made her\\ndaily complaint  mr palmer maintained the common\\nbut unfatherly opinion among his sex of all infants being alike\\nand though she could plainly perceive at different times\\nthe most striking resemblance between this baby and every\\none of his relations on both sides there was no convincing\\nhis father of it no persuading him to believe that it\\nwas not exactly like every other baby of the same age\\nnor could he even be brought to acknowledge the simple\\nproposition of its being the finest child in the world\\n\\ni come now to the relation of a misfortune\\nwhich about this time befell mrs john dashwood\\nit so happened that while her two sisters with\\nmrs jennings were first calling on her in harley street\\nanother of her acquaintance had dropt ina circumstance\\nin itself not apparently likely to produce evil to her\\nbut while the imaginations of other people will carry\\nthem away to form wrong judgments of our conduct\\nand to decide on it by slight appearances ones happiness\\nmust in some measure be always at the mercy of chance\\nin the present instance this lastarrived lady allowed\\nher fancy to so far outrun truth and probability\\nthat on merely hearing the name of the miss dashwoods\\nand understanding them to be mr dashwoods sisters\\nshe immediately concluded them to be staying in harley street\\nand this misconstruction produced within a day\\nor two afterwards cards of invitation for them\\nas well as for their brother and sister to a small\\nmusical party at her house  the consequence of which was\\nthat mrs john dashwood was obliged to submit not only\\nto the exceedingly great inconvenience of sending her\\ncarriage for the miss dashwoods but what was still worse\\nmust be subject to all the unpleasantness of appearing\\nto treat them with attention and who could tell that they\\nmight not expect to go out with her a second time  the power\\nof disappointing them it was true must always be hers\\nbut that was not enough for when people are determined\\non a mode of conduct which they know to be wrong they feel\\ninjured by the expectation of any thing better from them\\n\\nmarianne had now been brought by degrees so much\\ninto the habit of going out every day that it was become\\na matter of indifference to her whether she went or not\\nand she prepared quietly and mechanically for every\\nevenings engagement though without expecting the smallest\\namusement from any and very often without knowing\\ntill the last moment where it was to take her\\n\\nto her dress and appearance she was grown so perfectly\\nindifferent as not to bestow half the consideration on it\\nduring the whole of her toilet which it received from\\nmiss steele in the first five minutes of their being\\ntogether when it was finished  nothing escaped her minute\\nobservation and general curiosity she saw every thing\\nand asked every thing was never easy till she knew the price\\nof every part of mariannes dress could have guessed the\\nnumber of her gowns altogether with better judgment than\\nmarianne herself and was not without hopes of finding out\\nbefore they parted how much her washing cost per week\\nand how much she had every year to spend upon herself\\nthe impertinence of these kind of scrutinies moreover\\nwas generally concluded with a compliment which\\nthough meant as its douceur was considered by marianne\\nas the greatest impertinence of all for after undergoing\\nan examination into the value and make of her gown\\nthe colour of her shoes and the arrangement of her hair\\nshe was almost sure of being told that upon her word\\nshe looked vastly smart and she dared to say she would\\nmake a great many conquests\\n\\nwith such encouragement as this was she dismissed\\non the present occasion to her brothers carriage\\nwhich they were ready to enter five minutes after it\\nstopped at the door a punctuality not very agreeable\\nto their sisterinlaw who had preceded them to the house\\nof her acquaintance and was there hoping for some delay\\non their part that might inconvenience either herself\\nor her coachman\\n\\nthe events of this evening were not very remarkable\\nthe party like other musical parties comprehended a\\ngreat many people who had real taste for the performance\\nand a great many more who had none at all and the performers\\nthemselves were as usual in their own estimation\\nand that of their immediate friends the first private\\nperformers in england\\n\\nas elinor was neither musical nor affecting to be so\\nshe made no scruple of turning her eyes from the grand\\npianoforte whenever it suited her and unrestrained even\\nby the presence of a harp and violoncello would fix\\nthem at pleasure on any other object in the room  in one\\nof these excursive glances she perceived among a group\\nof young men the very he who had given them a lecture\\non toothpickcases at grays  she perceived him soon\\nafterwards looking at herself and speaking familiarly\\nto her brother and had just determined to find out his\\nname from the latter when they both came towards her\\nand mr dashwood introduced him to her as mr robert ferrars\\n\\nhe addressed her with easy civility and twisted\\nhis head into a bow which assured her as plainly as\\nwords could have done that he was exactly the coxcomb\\nshe had heard him described to be by lucy  happy had\\nit been for her if her regard for edward had depended\\nless on his own merit than on the merit of his nearest\\nrelations  for then his brothers bow must have given\\nthe finishing stroke to what the illhumour of his mother\\nand sister would have begun  but while she wondered\\nat the difference of the two young men she did not find\\nthat the emptiness of conceit of the one put her out\\nof all charity with the modesty and worth of the other\\nwhy they were different robert exclaimed to her himself\\nin the course of a quarter of an hours conversation\\nfor talking of his brother and lamenting the extreme\\ngaucherie which he really believed kept him from mixing\\nin proper society he candidly and generously attributed it\\nmuch less to any natural deficiency than to the misfortune\\nof a private education while he himself though probably\\nwithout any particular any material superiority\\nby nature merely from the advantage of a public school\\nwas as well fitted to mix in the world as any other man\\n\\nupon my soul he added i believe it is nothing more\\nand so i often tell my mother when she is grieving\\nabout it  my dear madam i always say to her you must\\nmake yourself easy  the evil is now irremediable\\nand it has been entirely your own doing  why would\\nyou be persuaded by my uncle sir robert against your\\nown judgment to place edward under private tuition\\nat the most critical time of his life  if you had only sent\\nhim to westminster as well as myself instead of sending\\nhim to mr pratts all this would have been prevented\\nthis is the way in which i always consider the matter\\nand my mother is perfectly convinced of her error\\n\\nelinor would not oppose his opinion because\\nwhatever might be her general estimation of the advantage\\nof a public school she could not think of edwards\\nabode in mr pratts family with any satisfaction\\n\\nyou reside in devonshire i thinkwas his\\nnext observation in a cottage near dawlish\\n\\nelinor set him right as to its situation\\nand it seemed rather surprising to him that anybody\\ncould live in devonshire without living near dawlish\\nhe bestowed his hearty approbation however on their\\nspecies of house\\n\\nfor my own part said he i am excessively fond\\nof a cottage there is always so much comfort so much\\nelegance about them  and i protest if i had any money\\nto spare i should buy a little land and build one myself\\nwithin a short distance of london where i might drive\\nmyself down at any time and collect a few friends\\nabout me and be happy  i advise every body who is going\\nto build to build a cottage  my friend lord courtland\\ncame to me the other day on purpose to ask my advice\\nand laid before me three different plans of bonomis\\ni was to decide on the best of them  my dear courtland\\nsaid i immediately throwing them all into the fire do not\\nadopt either of them but by all means build a cottage\\nand that i fancy will be the end of it\\n\\nsome people imagine that there can be no accommodations\\nno space in a cottage but this is all a mistake\\ni was last month at my friend elliotts near dartford\\nlady elliott wished to give a dance  but how can it\\nbe done said she my dear ferrars do tell me how it\\nis to be managed  there is not a room in this cottage\\nthat will hold ten couple and where can the supper be\\ni immediately saw that there could be no difficulty in it\\nso i said my dear lady elliott do not be uneasy\\nthe dining parlour will admit eighteen couple with ease\\ncardtables may be placed in the drawingroom the library\\nmay be open for tea and other refreshments and let the\\nsupper be set out in the saloon  lady elliott was delighted\\nwith the thought  we measured the diningroom and found\\nit would hold exactly eighteen couple and the affair\\nwas arranged precisely after my plan  so that in fact\\nyou see if people do but know how to set about it\\nevery comfort may be as well enjoyed in a cottage\\nas in the most spacious dwelling\\n\\nelinor agreed to it all for she did not think\\nhe deserved the compliment of rational opposition\\n\\nas john dashwood had no more pleasure in music than his\\neldest sister his mind was equally at liberty to fix on\\nany thing else and a thought struck him during the evening\\nwhich he communicated to his wife for her approbation\\nwhen they got home  the consideration of mrs dennisons\\nmistake\\nin supposing his sisters their guests had suggested the\\npropriety of their being really invited to become such\\nwhile mrs jennings engagements kept her from home\\nthe expense would be nothing the inconvenience not more\\nand it was altogether an attention which the delicacy\\nof his conscience pointed out to be requisite to its\\ncomplete enfranchisement from his promise to his father\\nfanny was startled at the proposal\\n\\ni do not see how it can be done said she\\nwithout affronting lady middleton for they spend every day\\nwith her otherwise i should be exceedingly glad to do it\\nyou know i am always ready to pay them any attention\\nin my power as my taking them out this evening shews\\nbut they are lady middletons visitors  how can i ask them\\naway from her\\n\\nher husband but with great humility did not see\\nthe force of her objection  they had already spent a week\\nin this manner in conduit street and lady middleton\\ncould not be displeased at their giving the same number\\nof days to such near relations\\n\\nfanny paused a moment and then with fresh vigor said\\n\\nmy love i would ask them with all my heart if it\\nwas in my power  but i had just settled within myself\\nto ask the miss steeles to spend a few days with us\\nthey are very well behaved good kind of girls and i think\\nthe attention is due to them as their uncle did so very\\nwell by edward  we can ask your sisters some other year\\nyou know but the miss steeles may not be in town any more\\ni am sure you will like them indeed you do like them\\nyou know very much already and so does my mother and they\\nare such favourites with harry\\n\\nmr dashwood was convinced  he saw the necessity\\nof inviting the miss steeles immediately and his conscience\\nwas pacified by the resolution of inviting his sisters\\nanother year at the same time however slyly suspecting\\nthat another year would make the invitation needless\\nby bringing elinor to town as colonel brandons wife\\nand marianne as their visitor\\n\\nfanny rejoicing in her escape and proud of the ready\\nwit that had procured it wrote the next morning to lucy\\nto request her company and her sisters for some days\\nin harley street as soon as lady middleton could spare them\\nthis was enough to make lucy really and reasonably happy\\nmrs dashwood seemed actually working for her herself\\ncherishing all her hopes and promoting all her views\\nsuch an opportunity of being with edward and his family was\\nabove all things the most material to her interest\\nand such an invitation the most gratifying to her\\nfeelings  it was an advantage that could not be too\\ngratefully acknowledged nor too speedily made use of\\nand the visit to lady middleton which had not before had\\nany precise limits was instantly discovered to have been\\nalways meant to end in two days time\\n\\nwhen the note was shown to elinor as it was within ten\\nminutes after its arrival it gave her for the first time\\nsome share in the expectations of lucy for such a mark\\nof uncommon kindness vouchsafed on so short an acquaintance\\nseemed to declare that the goodwill towards her arose\\nfrom something more than merely malice against herself\\nand might be brought by time and address to do\\nevery thing that lucy wished  her flattery had already\\nsubdued the pride of lady middleton and made an entry\\ninto the close heart of mrs john dashwood and these\\nwere effects that laid open the probability of greater\\n\\nthe miss steeles removed to harley street and all\\nthat reached elinor of their influence there strengthened\\nher expectation of the event  sir john who called on\\nthem more than once brought home such accounts of the\\nfavour they were in as must be universally striking\\nmrs dashwood had never been so much pleased with any\\nyoung women in her life as she was with them had given\\neach of them a needle book made by some emigrant\\ncalled lucy by her christian name and did not know\\nwhether she should ever be able to part with them\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nat this point in the first and second edtions volume ii ended\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 37\\n\\n\\nmrs palmer was so well at the end of a fortnight\\nthat her mother felt it no longer necessary to give up\\nthe whole of her time to her and contenting herself with\\nvisiting her once or twice a day returned from that period\\nto her own home and her own habits in which she found\\nthe miss dashwoods very ready to resume their former share\\n\\nabout the third or fourth morning after their\\nbeing thus resettled in berkeley street mrs jennings\\non returning from her ordinary visit to mrs palmer\\nentered the drawingroom where elinor was sitting\\nby herself with an air of such hurrying importance\\nas prepared her to hear something wonderful and giving her\\ntime only to form that idea began directly to justify it\\nby saying\\n\\nlord my dear miss dashwood have you heard the news\\n\\nno maam  what is it\\n\\nsomething so strange  but you shall hear it all\\nwhen i got to mr palmers i found charlotte quite\\nin a fuss about the child  she was sure it was very\\nillit cried and fretted and was all over pimples\\nso i looked at it directly and lord my dear\\nsays i it is nothing in the world but the red gum\\nand nurse said just the same  but charlotte she would\\nnot be satisfied so mr donavan was sent for and luckily\\nhe happened to just come in from harley street so he\\nstepped over directly and as soon as ever he saw the child\\nbe said just as we did that it was nothing in the world\\nbut the red gum and then charlotte was easy  and so\\njust as he was going away again it came into my head\\ni am sure i do not know how i happened to think of it\\nbut it came into my head to ask him if there was any news\\nso upon that he smirked and simpered and looked grave\\nand seemed to know something or other and at last he\\nsaid in a whisper for fear any unpleasant report\\nshould reach the young ladies under your care as to their\\nsisters indisposition i think it advisable to say\\nthat i believe there is no great reason for alarm i hope\\nmrs dashwood will do very well\\n\\nwhat is fanny ill\\n\\nthat is exactly what i said my dear  lord says i\\nis mrs dashwood ill so then it all came out and the\\nlong and the short of the matter by all i can learn\\nseems to be this  mr edward ferrars the very young\\nman i used to joke with you about but however as it\\nturns out i am monstrous glad there was never any thing\\nin it mr edward ferrars it seems has been engaged\\nabove this twelvemonth to my cousin lucytheres for you\\nmy dearand not a creature knowing a syllable of the matter\\nexcept nancycould you have believed such a thing possible\\nthere is no great wonder in their liking one another\\nbut that matters should be brought so forward between them\\nand nobody suspect itthat is strangei never happened\\nto see them together or i am sure i should have found it\\nout directly  well and so this was kept a great secret\\nfor fear of mrs ferrars and neither she nor your\\nbrother or sister suspected a word of the matter\\ntill this very morning poor nancy who you know is a\\nwellmeaning creature but no conjurer popt it all out\\nlord thinks she to herself they are all so fond\\nof lucy to be sure they will make no difficulty about it\\nand so away she went to your sister who was sitting all\\nalone at her carpetwork little suspecting what was to\\ncomefor she had just been saying to your brother only five\\nminutes before that she thought to make a match between\\nedward and some lords daughter or other i forget who\\nso you may think what a blow it was to all her vanity\\nand pride  she fell into violent hysterics immediately\\nwith such screams as reached your brothers ears\\nas he was sitting in his own dressingroom down stairs\\nthinking about writing a letter to his steward in the country\\nso up he flew directly and a terrible scene took place\\nfor lucy was come to them by that time little dreaming\\nwhat was going on  poor soul  i pity her  and i must say\\ni think she was used very hardly for your sister scolded\\nlike any fury and soon drove her into a fainting fit\\nnancy she fell upon her knees and cried bitterly\\nand your brother he walked about the room and said\\nhe did not know what to do  mrs dashwood declared\\nthey should not stay a minute longer in the house\\nand your brother was forced to go down upon his knees too\\nto persuade her to let them stay till they had packed\\nup their clothes  then she fell into hysterics again\\nand he was so frightened that he would send for mr donavan\\nand mr donavan found the house in all this uproar\\nthe carriage was at the door ready to take my poor\\ncousins away and they were just stepping in as he\\ncame off poor lucy in such a condition he says\\nshe could hardly walk and nancy she was almost as bad\\ni declare i have no patience with your sister and i hope\\nwith all my heart it will be a match in spite of her\\nlord what a taking poor mr edward will be in when he\\nhears of it  to have his love used so scornfully for\\nthey say he is monstrous fond of her as well he may\\ni should not wonder if he was to be in the greatest\\npassionand mr donavan thinks just the same  he and i\\nhad a great deal of talk about it and the best of all is\\nthat he is gone back again to harley street that he may\\nbe within call when mrs ferrars is told of it for she\\nwas sent for as soon as ever my cousins left the house\\nfor your sister was sure she would be in hysterics too\\nand so she may for what i care  i have no pity for\\neither of them  i have no notion of peoples making\\nsuch a todo about money and greatness  there is no\\nreason on earth why mr edward and lucy should not marry\\nfor i am sure mrs ferrars may afford to do very well\\nby her son and though lucy has next to nothing herself\\nshe knows better than any body how to make the most\\nof every thing i dare say if mrs ferrars would only\\nallow him five hundred ayear she would make as good\\nan appearance with it as any body else would with eight\\nlord how snug they might live in such another cottage\\nas yoursor a little biggerwith two maids and two men\\nand i believe i could help them to a housemaid for my\\nbetty has a sister out of place that would fit them\\nexactly\\n\\nhere mrs jennings ceased and as elinor had had\\ntime enough to collect her thoughts she was able\\nto give such an answer and make such observations\\nas the subject might naturally be supposed to produce\\nhappy to find that she was not suspected of any extraordinary\\ninterest in it that mrs jennings as she had of late\\noften hoped might be the case had ceased to imagine her\\nat all attached to edward and happy above all the rest\\nin the absence of marianne she felt very well able\\nto speak of the affair without embarrassment and to\\ngive her judgment as she believed with impartiality\\non the conduct of every one concerned in it\\n\\nshe could hardly determine what her own expectation\\nof its event really was though she earnestly tried\\nto drive away the notion of its being possible to end\\notherwise at last than in the marriage of edward and lucy\\nwhat mrs ferrars would say and do though there could\\nnot be a doubt of its nature she was anxious to hear\\nand still more anxious to know how edward would\\nconduct himself  for him she felt much compassion\\nfor lucy very littleand it cost her some pains to procure\\nthat littlefor the rest of the party none at all\\n\\nas mrs jennings could talk on no other subject\\nelinor soon saw the necessity of preparing marianne for\\nits discussion  no time was to be lost in undeceiving her\\nin making her acquainted with the real truth and in\\nendeavouring to bring her to hear it talked of by others\\nwithout betraying that she felt any uneasiness for her sister\\nor any resentment against edward\\n\\nelinors office was a painful oneshe was going\\nto remove what she really believed to be her sisters\\nchief consolationto give such particulars of edward as she\\nfeared would ruin him for ever in her good opinionand\\nto make marianne by a resemblance in their situations\\nwhich to her fancy would seem strong feel all her own\\ndisappointment over again  but unwelcome as such a task\\nmust be it was necessary to be done and elinor therefore\\nhastened to perform it\\n\\nshe was very far from wishing to dwell on her own\\nfeelings or to represent herself as suffering much\\nany otherwise than as the selfcommand she had practised\\nsince her first knowledge of edwards engagement might\\nsuggest a hint of what was practicable to marianne\\nher narration was clear and simple and though it could\\nnot be given without emotion it was not accompanied\\nby violent agitation nor impetuous griefthat belonged\\nrather to the hearer for marianne listened with horror\\nand cried excessively  elinor was to be the comforter\\nof others in her own distresses no less than in theirs\\nand all the comfort that could be given by assurances\\nof her own composure of mind and a very earnest\\nvindication of edward from every charge but of imprudence\\nwas readily offered\\n\\nbut marianne for some time would give credit to neither\\nedward seemed a second willoughby and acknowledging\\nas elinor did that she had loved him most sincerely\\ncould she feel less than herself  as for lucy steele\\nshe considered her so totally unamiable so absolutely\\nincapable of attaching a sensible man that she could\\nnot be persuaded at first to believe and afterwards\\nto pardon any former affection of edward for her\\nshe would not even admit it to have been natural\\nand elinor left her to be convinced that it was so\\nby that which only could convince her a better knowledge\\nof mankind\\n\\nher first communication had reached no farther than\\nto state the fact of the engagement and the length of time\\nit had existedmariannes feelings had then broken in\\nand put an end to all regularity of detail and for some\\ntime all that could be done was to soothe her distress\\nlessen her alarms and combat her resentment  the first\\nquestion on her side which led to farther particulars\\nwas\\n\\nhow long has this been known to you elinor has\\nhe written to you\\n\\ni have known it these four months  when lucy\\nfirst came to barton park last november she told me\\nin confidence of her engagement\\n\\nat these words mariannes eyes expressed the astonishment\\nwhich her lips could not utter  after a pause of wonder\\nshe exclaimed\\n\\nfour monthshave you known of this four months\\n\\nelinor confirmed it\\n\\nwhatwhile attending me in all my misery has this\\nbeen on your heartand i have reproached you for being\\nhappy\\n\\nit was not fit that you should then know how much\\ni was the reverse\\n\\nfour monthscried marianne againso calm\\nso cheerfulhow have you been supported\\n\\nby feeling that i was doing my dutymy promise to\\nlucy obliged me to be secret  i owed it to her therefore\\nto avoid giving any hint of the truth and i owed it to my\\nfamily and friends not to create in them a solicitude about me\\nwhich it could not be in my power to satisfy\\n\\nmarianne seemed much struck\\n\\ni have very often wished to undeceive yourself and my\\nmother added elinor and once or twice i have attempted it\\nbut without betraying my trust i never could have convinced\\nyou\\n\\nfour monthsand yet you loved him\\n\\nyes but i did not love only himand while the comfort\\nof others was dear to me i was glad to spare them from knowing\\nhow much i felt  now i can think and speak of it with\\nlittle emotion  i would not have you suffer on my account\\nfor i assure you i no longer suffer materially myself\\ni have many things to support me  i am not conscious of having\\nprovoked the disappointment by any imprudence of my own\\ni have borne it as much as possible without spreading\\nit farther  i acquit edward of essential misconduct\\ni wish him very happy and i am so sure of his always\\ndoing his duty that though now he may harbour some regret\\nin the end he must become so  lucy does not want sense\\nand that is the foundation on which every thing good may\\nbe builtand after all marianne after all that is\\nbewitching in the idea of a single and constant attachment\\nand all that can be said of ones happiness depending\\nentirely on any particular person it is not meantit\\nis not fitit is not possible that it should be so\\nedward will marry lucy he will marry a woman superior\\nin person and understanding to half her sex and time\\nand habit will teach him to forget that he ever thought\\nanother superior to her\\n\\nif such is your way of thinking said marianne\\nif the loss of what is most valued is so easily\\nto be made up by something else your resolution\\nyour selfcommand are perhaps a little less to be\\nwondered atthey are brought more within my comprehension\\n\\ni understand youyou do not suppose that i have ever\\nfelt muchfor four months marianne i have had all this\\nhanging on my mind without being at liberty to speak\\nof it to a single creature knowing that it would make\\nyou and my mother most unhappy whenever it were explained\\nto you yet unable to prepare you for it in the least\\nit was told meit was in a manner forced on me by the\\nvery person herself whose prior engagement ruined all\\nmy prospects and told me as i thought with triumph\\nthis persons suspicions therefore i have had to oppose\\nby endeavouring to appear indifferent where i have been most\\ndeeply interestedand it has not been only oncei have\\nhad her hopes and exultation to listen to again and again\\ni have known myself to be divided from edward for ever\\nwithout hearing one circumstance that could make me less\\ndesire the connectionnothing has proved him unworthy\\nnor has anything declared him indifferent to me\\ni have had to contend against the unkindness of his sister\\nand the insolence of his mother and have suffered the\\npunishment of an attachment without enjoying its advantages\\nand all this has been going on at a time when as you\\nknow too well it has not been my only unhappiness\\nif you can think me capable of ever feelingsurely you\\nmay suppose that i have suffered now  the composure\\nof mind with which i have brought myself at present\\nto consider the matter the consolation that i have been\\nwilling to admit have been the effect of constant and\\npainful exertionthey did not spring up of themselves\\nthey did not occur to relieve my spirits at first\\nno mariannethen if i had not been bound to silence\\nperhaps nothing could have kept me entirelynot even what i\\nowed to my dearest friendsfrom openly shewing that i was\\nvery unhappy\\n\\nmarianne was quite subdued\\n\\noh elinor she cried you have made me hate\\nmyself for everhow barbarous have i been to you\\nyou who have been my only comfort who have borne with me\\nin all my misery who have seemed to be only suffering\\nfor meis this my gratitudeis this the only return i\\ncan make youbecause your merit cries out upon myself\\ni have been trying to do it away\\n\\nthe tenderest caresses followed this confession\\nin such a frame of mind as she was now in elinor had\\nno difficulty in obtaining from her whatever promise\\nshe required and at her request marianne engaged\\nnever to speak of the affair to any one with the least\\nappearance of bitternessto meet lucy without betraying\\nthe smallest increase of dislike to herand even to see\\nedward himself if chance should bring them together\\nwithout any diminution of her usual cordiality\\nthese were great concessionsbut where marianne felt\\nthat she had injured no reparation could be too much\\nfor her to make\\n\\nshe performed her promise of being discreet\\nto admirationshe attended to all that mrs jennings\\nhad to say upon the subject with an unchanging complexion\\ndissented from her in nothing and was heard three\\ntimes to say yes maamshe listened to her praise\\nof lucy with only moving from one chair to another\\nand when mrs jennings talked of edwards affection\\nit cost her only a spasm in her throatsuch advances\\ntowards heroism in her sister made elinor feel equal\\nto any thing herself\\n\\nthe next morning brought a farther trial of it\\nin a visit from their brother who came with a most serious\\naspect to talk over the dreadful affair and bring them\\nnews of his wife\\n\\nyou have heard i suppose said he with great solemnity\\nas soon as he was seated of the very shocking discovery\\nthat took place under our roof yesterday\\n\\nthey all looked their assent it seemed too awful\\na

constitution\\nis a good one and her resolution equal to any thing\\nshe has borne it all with the fortitude of an angel\\nshe says she never shall think well of anybody again\\nand one cannot wonder at it after being so deceived\\nmeeting with such ingratitude where so much kindness\\nhad been shewn so much confidence had been placed  it\\nwas quite out of the benevolence of her heart that she\\nhad asked these young women to her house merely because\\nshe thought they deserved some attention were harmless\\nwellbehaved girls and would be pleasant companions\\nfor otherwise we both wished very much to have invited you\\nand marianne to be with us while your kind friend there\\nwas attending her daughter  and now to be so rewarded\\ni wish with all my heart says poor fanny in her\\naffectionate way that we had asked your sisters instead\\nof them\\n\\nhere he stopped to be thanked which being done\\nhe went on\\n\\nwhat poor mrs ferrars suffered when first fanny\\nbroke it to her is not to be described  while she with\\nthe truest affection had been planning a most eligible\\nconnection for him was it to be supposed that he could\\nbe all the time secretly engaged to another personsuch\\na suspicion could never have entered her head  if she\\nsuspected any prepossession elsewhere it could not be\\nin that quarter  there to be sure said she i might\\nhave thought myself safe she was quite in an agony\\nwe consulted together however as to what should be done\\nand at last she determined to send for edward\\nhe came  but i am sorry to relate what ensued\\nall that mrs ferrars could say to make him put an end\\nto the engagement assisted too as you may well suppose\\nby my arguments and fannys entreaties was of\\nno avail  duty affection every thing was disregarded\\ni never thought edward so stubborn so unfeeling before\\nhis mother explained to him her liberal designs in case\\nof his marrying miss morton told him she would settle on\\nhim the norfolk estate which clear of landtax brings\\nin a good thousand ayear offered even when matters\\ngrew desperate to make it twelve hundred and in opposition\\nto this if he still persisted in this low connection\\nrepresented to him the certain penury that must attend\\nthe match  his own two thousand pounds she protested\\nshould be his all she would never see him again and so far\\nwould she be from affording him the smallest assistance\\nthat if he were to enter into any profession with a view\\nof better support she would do all in her power to prevent\\nhim advancing in it\\n\\nhere marianne in an ecstasy of indignation\\nclapped her hands together and cried gracious god\\ncan this be possible\\n\\nwell may you wonder marianne replied her brother\\nat the obstinacy which could resist such arguments as these\\nyour exclamation is very natural\\n\\nmarianne was going to retort but she remembered\\nher promises and forbore\\n\\nall this however he continued was urged in vain\\nedward said very little but what he did say was in\\nthe most determined manner  nothing should prevail on\\nhim to give up his engagement  he would stand to it\\ncost him what it might\\n\\nthen cried mrs jennings with blunt sincerity\\nno longer able to be silent he has acted like an honest\\nman i beg your pardon mr dashwood but if he had\\ndone otherwise i should have thought him a rascal\\ni have some little concern in the business as well\\nas yourself for lucy steele is my cousin and i believe\\nthere is not a better kind of girl in the world nor one\\nwho more deserves a good husband\\n\\njohn dashwood was greatly astonished but his nature\\nwas calm not open to provocation and he never wished\\nto offend anybody especially anybody of good fortune\\nhe therefore replied without any resentment\\n\\ni would by no means speak disrespectfully of any\\nrelation of yours madam  miss lucy steele is i dare say\\na very deserving young woman but in the present case\\nyou know the connection must be impossible\\nand to have entered into a secret engagement with a\\nyoung man under her uncles care the son of a woman\\nespecially of such very large fortune as mrs ferrars\\nis perhaps altogether a little extraordinary in short\\ni do not mean to reflect upon the behaviour of any person\\nwhom you have a regard for mrs jennings  we all wish\\nher extremely happy and mrs ferrarss conduct throughout\\nthe whole has been such as every conscientious good mother\\nin like circumstances would adopt  it has been dignified\\nand liberal  edward has drawn his own lot and i fear\\nit will be a bad one\\n\\nmarianne sighed out her similar apprehension\\nand elinors heart wrung for the feelings of edward\\nwhile braving his mothers threats for a woman who could\\nnot reward him\\n\\nwell sir said mrs jennings and how did it end\\n\\ni am sorry to say maam in a most unhappy rupture\\nedward is dismissed for ever from his mothers notice\\nhe left her house yesterday but where he is gone or whether\\nhe is still in town i do not know for we of course can\\nmake no inquiry\\n\\npoor young manand what is to become of him\\n\\nwhat indeed maam  it is a melancholy consideration\\nborn to the prospect of such affluence  i cannot conceive\\na situation more deplorable  the interest of two thousand\\npoundshow can a man live on itand when to that is added\\nthe recollection that he might but for his own folly\\nwithin three months have been in the receipt of two\\nthousand five hundred ayear for miss morton has\\nthirty thousand pounds i cannot picture to myself\\na more wretched condition  we must all feel for him\\nand the more so because it is totally out of our power\\nto assist him\\n\\npoor young man cried mrs jennings i am sure\\nhe should be very welcome to bed and board at my house\\nand so i would tell him if i could see him  it is not fit\\nthat he should be living about at his own charge now\\nat lodgings and taverns\\n\\nelinors heart thanked her for such kindness towards edward\\nthough she could not forbear smiling at the form of it\\n\\nif he would only have done as well by himself\\nsaid john dashwood as all his friends were disposed to do\\nby him he might now have been in his proper situation\\nand would have wanted for nothing  but as it is it must\\nbe out of anybodys power to assist him  and there is one\\nthing more preparing against him which must be worse than\\nallhis mother has determined with a very natural kind\\nof spirit to settle that estate upon robert immediately\\nwhich might have been edwards on proper conditions\\ni left her this morning with her lawyer talking over\\nthe business\\n\\nwell said mrs jennings that is her revenge\\neverybody has a way of their own  but i dont think mine\\nwould be to make one son independent because another had\\nplagued me\\n\\nmarianne got up and walked about the room\\n\\ncan anything be more galling to the spirit of a man\\ncontinued john than to see his younger brother in\\npossession of an estate which might have been his own\\npoor edward  i feel for him sincerely\\n\\na few minutes more spent in the same kind of effusion\\nconcluded his visit and with repeated assurances to his\\nsisters that he really believed there was no material\\ndanger in fannys indisposition and that they need\\nnot therefore be very uneasy about it he went away\\nleaving the three ladies unanimous in their sentiments\\non the present occasion as far at least as it regarded\\nmrs ferrarss conduct the dashwoods and edwards\\n\\nmariannes indignation burst forth as soon as he\\nquitted the room and as her vehemence made reserve\\nimpossible in elinor and unnecessary in mrs jennings\\nthey all joined in a very spirited critique upon the party\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 38\\n\\n\\nmrs jennings was very warm in her praise of edwards\\nconduct but only elinor and marianne understood its\\ntrue merit  they only knew how little he had had to tempt\\nhim to be disobedient and how small was the consolation\\nbeyond the consciousness of doing right that could\\nremain to him in the loss of friends and fortune\\nelinor gloried in his integrity and marianne forgave all\\nhis offences in compassion for his punishment  but though\\nconfidence between them was by this public discovery\\nrestored to its proper state it was not a subject on\\nwhich either of them were fond of dwelling when alone\\nelinor avoided it upon principle as tending to fix still\\nmore upon her thoughts by the too warm too positive\\nassurances of marianne that belief of edwards continued\\naffection for herself which she rather wished to do away\\nand mariannes courage soon failed her in trying\\nto converse upon a topic which always left her more\\ndissatisfied with herself than ever by the comparison\\nit necessarily produced between elinors conduct and her own\\n\\nshe felt all the force of that comparison but not\\nas her sister had hoped to urge her to exertion now\\nshe felt it with all the pain of continual selfreproach\\nregretted most bitterly that she had never exerted\\nherself before but it brought only the torture of penitence\\nwithout the hope of amendment  her mind was so much weakened\\nthat she still fancied present exertion impossible\\nand therefore it only dispirited her more\\n\\nnothing new was heard by them for a day or two afterwards\\nof affairs in harley street or bartletts buildings\\nbut though so much of the matter was known to them already\\nthat mrs jennings might have had enough to do in spreading\\nthat knowledge farther without seeking after more\\nshe had resolved from the first to pay a visit of comfort\\nand inquiry to her cousins as soon as she could\\nand nothing but the hindrance of more visitors than usual\\nhad prevented her going to them within that time\\n\\nthe third day succeeding their knowledge of the\\nparticulars was so fine so beautiful a sunday as to draw\\nmany to kensington gardens though it was only the second\\nweek in march  mrs jennings and elinor were of the number\\nbut marianne who knew that the willoughbys were again\\nin town and had a constant dread of meeting them\\nchose rather to stay at home than venture into so public\\na place\\n\\nan intimate acquaintance of mrs jennings joined\\nthem soon after they entered the gardens and elinor was\\nnot sorry that by her continuing with them and engaging\\nall mrs jenningss conversation she was herself left\\nto quiet reflection  she saw nothing of the willoughbys\\nnothing of edward and for some time nothing of anybody\\nwho could by any chance whether grave or gay be interesting\\nto her  but at last she found herself with some surprise\\naccosted by miss steele who though looking rather shy\\nexpressed great satisfaction in meeting them and on receiving\\nencouragement from the particular kindness of mrs jennings\\nleft her own party for a short time to join theirs\\nmrs jennings immediately whispered to elinor\\n\\nget it all out of her my dear  she will tell you\\nany thing if you ask  you see i cannot leave mrs clarke\\n\\nit was lucky however for mrs jenningss curiosity\\nand elinors too that she would tell any thing without\\nbeing asked for nothing would otherwise have been learnt\\n\\ni am so glad to meet you said miss steele\\ntaking her familiarly by the armfor i wanted to see you\\nof all things in the world  and then lowering her voice\\ni suppose mrs jennings has heard all about it\\nis she angry\\n\\nnot at all i believe with you\\n\\nthat is a good thing  and lady middleton is she angry\\n\\ni cannot suppose it possible that she should\\n\\ni am monstrous glad of it  good gracious  i have\\nhad such a time of it  i never saw lucy in such a rage\\nin my life  she vowed at first she would never trim me\\nup a new bonnet nor do any thing else for me again\\nso long as she lived but now she is quite come to\\nand we are as good friends as ever  look she made me\\nthis bow to my hat and put in the feather last night\\nthere now you are going to laugh at me too  but why\\nshould not i wear pink ribbons  i do not care if it is\\nthe doctors favourite colour  i am sure for my part\\ni should never have known he did like it better than\\nany other colour if he had not happened to say so\\nmy cousins have been so plaguing me  i declare sometimes\\ni do not know which way to look before them\\n\\nshe had wandered away to a subject on which elinor\\nhad nothing to say and therefore soon judged it expedient\\nto find her way back again to the first\\n\\nwell but miss dashwood speaking triumphantly\\npeople may say what they chuse about mr ferrarss\\ndeclaring he would not have lucy for it is no such thing\\ni can tell you and it is quite a shame for such illnatured\\nreports to be spread abroad  whatever lucy might think\\nabout it herself you know it was no business of other\\npeople to set it down for certain\\n\\ni never heard any thing of the kind hinted at before\\ni assure you said elinor\\n\\noh did not you  but it was said i know very well\\nand by more than one for miss godby told miss sparks\\nthat nobody in their senses could expect mr ferrars\\nto give up a woman like miss morton with thirty thousand\\npounds to her fortune for lucy steele that had\\nnothing at all and i had it from miss sparks myself\\nand besides that my cousin richard said himself\\nthat when it came to the point he was afraid mr ferrars\\nwould be off and when edward did not come near us\\nfor three days i could not tell what to think myself\\nand i believe in my heart lucy gave it up all for lost\\nfor we came away from your brothers wednesday\\nand we saw nothing of him not all thursday friday\\nand saturday and did not know what was become of him\\nonce lucy thought to write to him but then her spirits\\nrose against that  however this morning he came just\\nas we came home from church and then it all came out\\nhow he had been sent for wednesday to harley street\\nand been talked to by his mother and all of them\\nand how he had declared before them all that he loved\\nnobody but lucy and nobody but lucy would he have\\nand how he had been so worried by what passed\\nthat as soon as he had went away from his mothers house\\nhe had got upon his horse and rid into the country\\nsome where or other and how he had stayed about at an inn\\nall thursday and friday on purpose to get the better\\nof it  and after thinking it all over and over again\\nhe said it seemed to him as if now he had no fortune\\nand no nothing at all it would be quite unkind to keep\\nher on to the engagement because it must be for her loss\\nfor he had nothing but two thousand pounds and no hope\\nof any thing else and if he was to go into orders\\nas he had some thoughts he could get nothing but a curacy\\nand how was they to live upon thathe could not bear\\nto think of her doing no better and so he begged\\nif she had the least mind for it to put an end to the\\nmatter directly and leave him shift for himself\\ni heard him say all this as plain as could possibly be\\nand it was entirely for her sake and upon her account\\nthat he said a word about being off and not upon his own\\ni will take my oath he never dropt a syllable of being\\ntired of her or of wishing to marry miss morton or any\\nthing like it  but to be sure lucy would not give\\near to such kind of talking so she told him directly\\nwith a great deal about sweet and love you know\\nand all thatoh la one cant repeat such kind of things\\nyou knowshe told him directly she had not the least\\nmind in the world to be off for she could live with him\\nupon a trifle and how little so ever he might have\\nshe should be very glad to have it all you know\\nor something of the kind  so then he was monstrous happy\\nand talked on some time about what they should do\\nand they agreed he should take orders directly\\nand they must wait to be married till he got a living\\nand just then i could not hear any more for my cousin\\ncalled from below to tell me mrs richardson was come in\\nher coach and would take one of us to kensington gardens\\nso i was forced to go into the room and interrupt them\\nto ask lucy if she would like to go but she did not\\ncare to leave edward so i just run up stairs and put\\non a pair of silk stockings and came off with the richardsons\\n\\ni do not understand what you mean by interrupting them\\nsaid elinor you were all in the same room together\\nwere not you\\n\\nno indeed not us  la miss dashwood do you\\nthink people make love when any body else is by  oh\\nfor shameto be sure you must know better than that\\nlaughing affectedlyno no they were shut up in the\\ndrawingroom together and all i heard was only by listening\\nat the door\\n\\nhow cried elinor have you been repeating to me\\nwhat you only learnt yourself by listening at the door\\ni am sorry i did not know it before for i certainly\\nwould not have suffered you to give me particulars of a\\nconversation which you ought not to have known yourself\\nhow could you behave so unfairly by your sister\\n\\noh la there is nothing in that  i only stood at\\nthe door and heard what i could  and i am sure lucy would\\nhave done just the same by me for a year or two back\\nwhen martha sharpe and i had so many secrets together\\nshe never made any bones of hiding in a closet or behind\\na chimneyboard on purpose to hear what we said\\n\\nelinor tried to talk of something else but miss\\nsteele could not be kept beyond a couple of minutes\\nfrom what was uppermost in her mind\\n\\nedward talks of going to oxford soon said she\\nbut now he is lodging at no  pall mall  what an\\nillnatured woman his mother is ant she and your\\nbrother and sister were not very kind however\\ni shant say anything against them to you and to be sure\\nthey did send us home in their own chariot which\\nwas more than i looked for  and for my part i was all\\nin a fright for fear your sister should ask us for the\\nhuswifes she had gave us a day or two before but however\\nnothing was said about them and i took care to keep mine\\nout of sight  edward have got some business at oxford\\nhe says so he must go there for a time and after that\\nas soon as he can light upon a bishop he will be ordained\\ni wonder what curacy he will getgood gracious\\ngiggling as she spoke id lay my life i know what\\nmy cousins will say when they hear of it  they will\\ntell me i should write to the doctor to get edward\\nthe curacy of his new living  i know they will but i am\\nsure i would not do such a thing for all the world\\nla i shall say directly i wonder how you could think\\nof such a thing  i write to the doctor indeed\\n\\nwell said elinor it is a comfort to be prepared\\nagainst the worst  you have got your answer ready\\n\\nmiss steele was going to reply on the same subject\\nbut the approach of her own party made another more necessary\\n\\noh la here come the richardsons  i had a vast deal\\nmore to say to you but i must not stay away from them not\\nany longer  i assure you they are very genteel people\\nhe makes a monstrous deal of money and they keep their\\nown coach  i have not time to speak to mrs jennings about\\nit myself but pray tell her i am quite happy to hear she\\nis not in anger against us and lady middleton the same\\nand if anything should happen to take you and your\\nsister away and mrs jennings should want company\\ni am sure we should be very glad to come and stay with her\\nfor as long a time as she likes  i suppose lady middleton\\nwont ask us any more this bout  goodby i am sorry\\nmiss marianne was not here  remember me kindly to her\\nla if you have not got your spotted muslin oni wonder\\nyou was not afraid of its being torn\\n\\nsuch was her parting concern for after this she had\\ntime only to pay her farewell compliments to mrs jennings\\nbefore her company was claimed by mrs richardson\\nand elinor was left in possession of knowledge which\\nmight feed her powers of reflection some time though she\\nhad learnt very little more than what had been already\\nforeseen and foreplanned in her own mind  edwards marriage\\nwith lucy was as firmly determined on and the time\\nof its taking place remained as absolutely uncertain\\nas she had concluded it would beevery thing depended\\nexactly after her expectation on his getting that preferment\\nof which at present there seemed not the smallest chance\\n\\nas soon as they returned to the carriage\\nmrs jennings was eager for information but as elinor\\nwished to spread as little as possible intelligence\\nthat had in the first place been so unfairly obtained\\nshe confined herself to the brief repetition of such\\nsimple particulars as she felt assured that lucy\\nfor the sake of her own consequence would choose\\nto have known  the continuance of their engagement\\nand the means that were able to be taken for promoting\\nits end was all her communication and this produced\\nfrom mrs jennings the following natural remark\\n\\nwait for his having a livingay we all know how\\nthat will endthey will wait a twelvemonth and finding\\nno good comes of it will set down upon a curacy of fifty\\npounds ayear with the interest of his two thousand pounds\\nand what little matter mr steele and mr pratt can\\ngive herthen they will have a child every year and\\nlord help em how poor they will bei must see\\nwhat i can give them towards furnishing their house\\ntwo maids and two men indeedas i talked of tother\\ndayno no they must get a stout girl of all works\\nbettys sister would never do for them now\\n\\nthe next morning brought elinor a letter by the\\ntwopenny post from lucy herself  it was as follows\\n\\n                    bartletts building march\\n\\n     i hope my dear miss dashwood will excuse the\\n     liberty i take of writing to her but i know your\\n     friendship for me will make you pleased to hear such\\n     a good account of myself and my dear edward after\\n     all the troubles we have went through lately\\n     therefore will make no more apologies but proceed\\n     to say that thank god though we have suffered\\n     dreadfully we are both quite well now and as happy\\n     as we must always be in one anothers love  we have\\n     had great trials and great persecutions but\\n     however at the same time gratefully acknowledge\\n     many friends yourself not the least among them\\n     whose great kindness i shall always thankfully\\n     remember as will edward too who i have told of\\n     it  i am sure you will be glad to hear as likewise\\n     dear mrs jennings i spent two happy hours with\\n     him yesterday afternoon he would not hear of our\\n     parting though earnestly did i as i thought my\\n     duty required urge him to it for prudence sake\\n     and would have parted for ever on the spot would\\n     he consent to it but he said it should never be\\n     he did not regard his mothers anger while he could\\n     have my affections our prospects are not very\\n     bright to be sure but we must wait and hope for\\n     the best he will be ordained shortly and should\\n     it ever be in your power to recommend him to any\\n     body that has a living to bestow am very sure you\\n     will not forget us and dear mrs jennings too\\n     trust she will speak a good word for us to sir john\\n     or mr palmer or any friend that may be able to\\n     assist uspoor anne was much to blame for what\\n     she did but she did it for the best so i say\\n     nothing hope mrs jennings

me to conclude and begging to be most gratefully\\n     and respectfully remembered to her and to sir john\\n     and lady middleton and the dear children when you\\n     chance to see them and love

of mrs jennings who read it\\naloud with many comments of satisfaction and praise\\n\\nvery well indeedhow prettily she writesaye\\nthat was quite proper to let him be off if he would\\nthat was just

head\\nand heart great credit\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 39\\n\\n\\nthe miss dashwoods had now been rather more than\\ntwo months in town and mariannes impatience to be gone\\nincreased every day  she sighed for the air the liberty\\nthe quiet of the country and fancied that if any place\\ncould give her ease barton must do it  elinor was hardly\\nless anxious than herself for their removal and only so much\\nless bent on its being effected immediately as that she\\nwas conscious of the difficulties of so long a journey\\nwhich marianne could not be brought to acknowledge\\nshe began however seriously to turn her thoughts towards\\nits accomplishment and had already mentioned their wishes\\nto their kind hostess who resisted them with all the\\neloquence of her goodwill when a plan was suggested\\nwhich though detaining them from home yet a few weeks\\nlonger appeared to elinor altogether much more eligible\\nthan any other the palmers were to remove to cleveland\\nabout the end of march for the easter holidays\\nand mrs jennings with both her friends received a very\\nwarm invitation from charlotte to go with them  this would\\nnot in itself have been sufficient for the delicacy of\\nmiss dashwoodbut it was inforced with so much real\\npoliteness by mr palmer himself as joined to the very\\ngreat amendment of his manners towards them since her\\nsister had been known to be unhappy induced her to accept\\nit with pleasure\\n\\nwhen she told marianne what she had done however\\nher first reply was not very auspicious\\n\\nclevelandshe cried with great agitation\\nno i cannot go to cleveland\\n\\nyou forget said elinor gently that its situation\\nis notthat it is not in the neighbourhood of\\n\\nbut it is in somersetshirei cannot go\\ninto somersetshirethere where i looked forward\\nto goingno elinor you cannot expect me to go there\\n\\nelinor would not argue upon the propriety of overcoming\\nsuch feelingsshe only endeavoured to counteract them by\\nworking on othersrepresented it therefore as a measure\\nwhich would fix the time of her returning to that dear mother\\nwhom she so much wished to see in a more eligible\\nmore comfortable manner than any other plan could do\\nand perhaps without any greater delay  from cleveland\\nwhich was within a few miles of bristol the distance to\\nbarton was not beyond one day though a long days journey\\nand their mothers servant might easily come there to attend\\nthem down and as there could be no occasion of their\\nstaying above a week at cleveland they might now be at\\nhome in little more than three weeks time  as mariannes\\naffection for her mother was sincere it must triumph\\nwith little difficulty over the imaginary evils she had started\\n\\nmrs jennings was so far from being weary of her guest\\nthat she pressed them very earnestly to return with her again\\nfrom cleveland  elinor was grateful for the attention\\nbut it could not alter her design and their mothers\\nconcurrence being readily gained every thing relative\\nto their return was arranged as far as it could be\\nand marianne found some relief in drawing up a statement\\nof the hours that were yet to divide her from barton\\n\\nah colonel i do not know what you and i shall\\ndo without the miss dashwoodswas mrs jenningss\\naddress to him when he first called on her after their\\nleaving her was settledfor they are quite resolved\\nupon going home from the palmersand how forlorn we\\nshall be when i come backlord we shall sit and gape\\nat one another as dull as two cats\\n\\nperhaps mrs jennings was in hopes by this vigorous\\nsketch of their future ennui to provoke him to make\\nthat offer which might give himself an escape from it\\nand if so she had soon afterwards good reason to think\\nher object gained for on elinors moving to the window\\nto take more expeditiously the dimensions of a print\\nwhich she was going to copy for her friend he followed\\nher to it with a look of particular meaning and conversed\\nwith her there for several minutes  the effect of his\\ndiscourse on the lady too could not escape her observation\\nfor though she was too honorable to listen and had even\\nchanged her seat on purpose that she might not hear\\nto one close by the piano forte on which marianne\\nwas playing she could not keep herself from seeing\\nthat elinor changed colour attended with agitation\\nand was too intent on what he said to pursue her employment\\nstill farther in confirmation of her hopes in the interval\\nof mariannes turning from one lesson to another\\nsome words of the colonels inevitably reached her ear\\nin which he seemed to be apologising for the badness\\nof his house  this set the matter beyond a doubt\\nshe wondered indeed at his thinking it necessary\\nto do so but supposed it to be the proper etiquette\\nwhat elinor said in reply she could not distinguish\\nbut judged from the motion of her lips that she did\\nnot think that any material objectionand mrs jennings\\ncommended her in her heart for being so honest\\nthey then talked on for a few minutes longer without her\\ncatching a syllable when another lucky stop in mariannes\\nperformance brought her these words in the colonels calm voice\\n\\ni am afraid it cannot take place very soon\\n\\nastonished and shocked at so unloverlike a speech\\nshe was almost ready to cry out lord what should\\nhinder itbut checking her desire confined herself\\nto this silent ejaculation\\n\\nthis is very strangesure he need not wait to be older\\n\\nthis delay on the colonels side however did not\\nseem to offend or mortify his fair companion in the least\\nfor on their breaking up the conference soon afterwards\\nand moving different ways mrs jennings very plainly heard\\nelinor say and with a voice which shewed her to feel what she said\\n\\ni shall always think myself very much obliged to you\\n\\nmrs jennings was delighted with her gratitude\\nand only wondered that after hearing such a sentence\\nthe colonel should be able to take leave of them as he\\nimmediately did with the utmost sangfroid and go away\\nwithout making her any replyshe had not thought her old\\nfriend could have made so indifferent a suitor\\n\\nwhat had really passed between them was to this effect\\n\\ni have heard said he with great compassion\\nof the injustice your friend mr ferrars has suffered\\nfrom his family for if i understand the matter right\\nhe has been entirely cast off by them for persevering\\nin his engagement with a very deserving young woman\\nhave i been rightly informedis it so\\n\\nelinor told him that it was\\n\\nthe cruelty the impolitic crueltyhe replied\\nwith great feelingof dividing or attempting to divide\\ntwo young people long attached to each other is terrible\\nmrs ferrars does not know what she may be doingwhat\\nshe may drive her son to  i have seen mr ferrars two\\nor three times in harley street and am much pleased\\nwith him  he is not a young man with whom one can\\nbe intimately acquainted in a short time but i have\\nseen enough of him to wish him well for his own sake\\nand as a friend of yours i wish it still more\\ni understand that he intends to take orders  will you\\nbe so good as to tell him that the living of delaford\\nnow just vacant as i am informed by this days post\\nis his if he think it worth his acceptancebut that\\nperhaps so unfortunately circumstanced as he is now\\nit may be  nonsense to appear to doubt i only wish it\\nwere more  valuable it is a rectory but a small one\\nthe late incumbent i believe did not make more than\\n200 l per annum and though it is certainly capable\\nof improvement i fear not to such an amount as\\nto afford him a very comfortable income  such as it is\\nhowever my pleasure in presenting him to it\\nwill be very great  pray assure him of it\\n\\nelinors astonishment at this commission could\\nhardly have been greater had the colonel been really\\nmaking her an offer of his hand  the preferment\\nwhich only two days before she had considered as hopeless\\nfor edward was already provided to enable him to marry\\nand she of all people in the world was fixed on to\\nbestow ither emotion was such as mrs jennings had\\nattributed to a very different causebut whatever minor\\nfeelings less pure less pleasing might have a share\\nin that emotion her esteem for the general benevolence\\nand her gratitude for the particular friendship\\nwhich together prompted colonel brandon to this act\\nwere strongly felt and warmly expressed  she thanked him\\nfor it with all her heart spoke of edwards principles and\\ndisposition with that praise which she knew them to deserve\\nand promised to undertake the commission with pleasure\\nif it were really his wish to put off so agreeable an office\\nto another  but at the same time she could not help\\nthinking that no one could so well perform it as himself\\nit was an office in short from which unwilling to give\\nedward the pain of receiving an obligation from her\\nshe would have been very glad to be spared herself\\nbut colonel brandon on motives of equal delicacy\\ndeclining it likewise still seemed so desirous of its being\\ngiven through her means that she would not on any account\\nmake farther opposition  edward she believed was still in\\ntown\\nand fortunately she had heard his address from miss steele\\nshe could undertake therefore to inform him of it\\nin the course of the day  after this had been settled\\ncolonel brandon began to talk of his own advantage\\nin securing so respectable and agreeable a neighbour\\nand then it was that he mentioned with regret that the\\nhouse was small and indifferentan evil which elinor\\nas mrs jennings had supposed her to do made very light of\\nat least as far as regarded its size\\n\\nthe smallness of the house said she\\ni cannot imagine any inconvenience to them\\nfor it will be in proportion to their family and income\\n\\nby which the colonel was surprised to find that she\\nwas considering mr ferrarss marriage as the certain\\nconsequence of the presentation for he did not suppose it\\npossible that delaford living could supply such an income\\nas anybody in his style of life would venture to settle on\\nand he said so\\n\\nthis little rectory can do no more than make mr ferrars\\ncomfortable as a bachelor it cannot enable him to marry\\ni am sorry to say that my patronage ends with this\\nand my interest is hardly more extensive  if however\\nby an unforeseen chance it should be in my power to serve\\nhim farther i must think very differently of him\\nfrom what i now do if i am not as ready to be useful\\nto him then as i sincerely wish i could be at present\\nwhat i am now doing indeed seems nothing at all\\nsince it can advance him so little towards what must\\nbe his principal his only object of happiness\\nhis marriage must still be a distant goodat least\\ni am afraid it cannot take place very soon\\n\\nsuch was the sentence which when misunderstood\\nso justly offended the delicate feelings of mrs jennings\\nbut after this narration of what really passed between\\ncolonel brandon and elinor while they stood at the window\\nthe gratitude expressed by the latter on their parting may\\nperhaps appear in general not less reasonably excited\\nnor less properly worded than if it had arisen from\\nan offer of marriage\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 40\\n\\n\\nwell miss dashwood said mrs jennings\\nsagaciously smiling as soon as the gentleman had withdrawn\\ni do not ask you what the colonel has been saying to you\\nfor though upon my honour i tried to keep out of hearing\\ni could not help catching enough to understand his business\\nand i assure you i never was better pleased in my life\\nand i wish you joy of it with all my heart\\n\\nthank you maam said elinor  it is a matter\\nof great joy to me and i feel the goodness of colonel\\nbrandon most sensibly  there are not many men who would\\nact as he has done  few people who have so compassionate\\na heart  i never was more astonished in my life\\n\\nlord my dear you are very modest  i ant the least\\nastonished at it in the world for i have often thought\\nof late there was nothing more likely to happen\\n\\nyou judged from your knowledge of the colonels\\ngeneral benevolence but at least you could not foresee\\nthat the opportunity would so very soon occur\\n\\nopportunity repeated mrs jenningsoh as to that\\nwhen a man has once made up his mind to such a thing\\nsomehow or other he will soon find an opportunity\\nwell my dear i wish you joy of it again and again\\nand if ever there was a happy couple in the world i think\\ni shall soon know where to look for them\\n\\nyou mean to go to delaford after them i suppose\\nsaid elinor with a faint smile\\n\\naye my dear that i do indeed  and as to the house\\nbeing a bad one i do not know what the colonel would be at\\nfor it is as good a one as ever i saw\\n\\nhe spoke of its being out of repair\\n\\nwell and whose fault is that why dont he repair it\\nwho should do it but himself\\n\\nthey were interrupted by the servants coming in to\\nannounce the carriage being at the door and mrs jennings\\nimmediately preparing to go said\\n\\nwell my dear i must be gone before i have had half\\nmy talk out  but however we may have it all over in\\nthe evening for we shall be quite alone  i do not ask\\nyou to go with me for i dare say your mind is too full\\nof the matter to care for company and besides you must\\nlong to tell your sister all about it\\n\\nmarianne had left the room before the conversation began\\n\\ncertainly maam i shall tell marianne of it\\nbut i shall not mention it at present to any body else\\n\\noh very well said mrs jennings rather disappointed\\nthen you would not have me tell it to lucy for i think\\nof going as far as holborn today\\n\\nno maam not even lucy if you please\\none days delay will not be very material and till i\\nhave written to mr ferrars i think it ought not to be\\nmentioned to any body else  i shall do that directly\\nit is of importance that no time should be lost with him\\nfor he will of course have much to do relative to\\nhis ordination\\n\\nthis speech at first puzzled mrs jennings exceedingly\\nwhy mr ferrars was to have been written to about it\\nin such a hurry she could not immediately comprehend\\na few moments reflection however produced a very happy idea\\nand she exclaimed\\n\\noh hoi understand you  mr ferrars is to be\\nthe man  well so much the better for him  ay to be sure\\nhe must be ordained in readiness and i am very glad\\nto find things are so forward between you  but my dear\\nis not this rather out of character  should not the colonel\\nwrite himselfsure he is the proper person\\n\\nelinor did not quite understand the beginning of\\nmrs jenningss speech neither did she think it worth\\ninquiring into and therefore only replied to its conclusion\\n\\ncolonel brandon is so delicate a man that he rather\\nwished any one to announce his intentions to mr ferrars\\nthan himself\\n\\nand so you are forced to do it  well that is an odd\\nkind of delicacy  however i will not disturb you seeing\\nher preparing to write  you know your own concerns best\\nso goodby my dear  i have not heard of any thing to\\nplease me so well since charlotte was brought to bed\\n\\nand away she went but returning again in a moment\\n\\ni have just been thinking of bettys sister my dear\\ni should be very glad to get her so good a mistress\\nbut whether she would do for a ladys maid i am sure i\\ncant tell  she is an excellent housemaid and works\\nvery well at her needle  however you will think of all\\nthat at your leisure\\n\\ncertainly maam replied elinor not hearing\\nmuch of what she said and more anxious to be alone\\nthan to be mistress of the subject\\n\\nhow she should beginhow she should express\\nherself in her note to edward was now all her concern\\nthe particular circumstances between them made\\na difficulty of that which to any other person would\\nhave been the easiest thing in the world but she\\nequally feared to say too much or too little and sat\\ndeliberating over her paper with the pen in her band\\ntill broken in on by the entrance of edward himself\\n\\nhe had met mrs jennings at the door in her way to\\nthe carriage as he came to leave his farewell card and she\\nafter apologising for not returning herself had obliged\\nhim to enter by saying that miss dashwood was above\\nand wanted to speak with him on very particular business\\n\\nelinor had just been congratulating herself\\nin the midst of her perplexity that however difficult it\\nmight be to express herself properly by letter it was\\nat least preferable to giving the information by word\\nof mouth when her visitor entered to force her upon this\\ngreatest exertion of all  her astonishment and confusion\\nwere very great on his so sudden appearance  she had\\nnot seen him before since his engagement became public\\nand therefore not since his knowing her to be acquainted\\nwith it which with the consciousness of what she\\nhad been thinking of and what she had to tell him\\nmade her feel particularly uncomfortable for some minutes\\nhe too was much distressed and they sat down together\\nin a most promising state of embarrassmentwhether he\\nhad asked her pardon for his intrusion on first coming\\ninto the room he could not recollect but determining\\nto be on the safe side he made his apology in form\\nas soon as he could say any thing after taking a chair\\n\\nmrs jennings told me said he that you wished\\nto speak with me at least i understood her soor i\\ncertainly should not have intruded on you in such a manner\\nthough at the same time i should have been extremely\\nsorry to leave london without seeing you and your sister\\nespecially as it will most likely be some timeit\\nis not probable that i should soon have the pleasure\\nof meeting you again  i go to oxford tomorrow\\n\\nyou would not have gone however said elinor\\nrecovering herself and determined to get over what she\\nso much dreaded as soon as possible without receiving\\nour good wishes even if we had not been able to give them\\nin person  mrs jennings was quite right in what she said\\ni have something of consequence to inform you of\\nwhich i was on the point of communicating by paper\\ni am charged with a most agreeable office breathing\\nrather faster than usual as she spoke  colonel brandon\\nwho was here only ten minutes ago has desired me to say\\nthat understanding you mean to take orders he has\\ngreat pleasure in offering you the living of delaford\\nnow just vacant and only wishes it were more valuable\\nallow me to congratulate you on having so respectable\\nand welljudging a friend and to join in his wish that\\nthe livingit is about two hundred ayearwere much\\nmore considerable and such as might better enable you\\ntoas might be more than a temporary accommodation to\\nyourselfsuch in short as might establish all your views\\nof happiness\\n\\nwhat edward felt as he could not say it himself\\nit cannot be expected that any one else should say for him\\nhe looked all the astonishment which such unexpected\\nsuch unthoughtof information could not fail of exciting\\nbut he said only these two words\\n\\ncolonel brandon\\n\\nyes continued elinor gathering more resolution\\nas some of the worst was over colonel brandon means\\nit as a testimony of his concern for what has lately\\npassedfor the cruel situation in which the unjustifiable\\nconduct of your family has placed youa concern\\nwhich i am sure marianne myself and all your friends\\nmust share and likewise as a proof of his high esteem\\nfor your general character and his particular approbation\\nof your behaviour on the present occasion\\n\\ncolonel brandon give me a livingcan it be possible\\n\\nthe unkindness of your own relations has made you\\nastonished to find friendship any where\\n\\nno replied be with sudden consciousness not to\\nfind it in you for i cannot be ignorant that to you\\nto your goodness i owe it alli feel iti would express\\nit if i couldbut as you well know i am no orator\\n\\nyou are very much mistaken  i do assure you\\nthat you owe it entirely at least almost entirely\\nto your own merit and colonel brandons discernment\\nof it  i have had no hand in it  i did not even know\\ntill i understood his design that the living was vacant\\nnor had it ever occurred to me that he might have\\nhad such a living in his gift  as a friend of mine\\nof my family he may perhapsindeed i know he has\\nstill greater pleasure in bestowing it but upon my word\\nyou owe nothing to my solicitation\\n\\ntruth obliged her to acknowledge some small share\\nin the action but she was at the same time so unwilling\\nto appear as the benefactress of edward that she acknowledged\\nit with hesitation which probably contributed to fix\\nthat suspicion in his mind which had recently entered it\\nfor a short time he sat deep in thought after elinor had ceased\\nto speakat last and as if it were rather an effort he said\\n\\ncolonel brandon seems a man of great worth and respectability\\ni have always heard him spoken of as such and your brother\\ni know esteems him highly  he is undoubtedly a sensible man\\nand in his manners perfectly the gentleman\\n\\nindeed replied elinor i believe that you will find him\\non farther acquaintance all that you have heard him to be\\nand as you will be such very near neighbours for i understand\\nthe parsonage is almost close to the mansionhouse\\nit is particularly important that he should be all this\\n\\nedward made no answer but when she had turned\\naway her head gave her a look so serious so earnest\\nso uncheerful as seemed to say that he might hereafter wish\\nthe distance between the parsonage and the mansionhouse\\nmuch greater\\n\\ncolonel brandon i think lodges in st james street\\nsaid he soon afterwards rising from his chair\\n\\nelinor told him the number of the house\\n\\ni must hurry away then to give him those thanks\\nwhich you will not allow me to give you to assure him\\nthat he has made me a veryan exceedingly happy man\\n\\nelinor did not offer to detain him and they parted\\nwith a very earnest assurance on her side of her unceasing\\ngood wishes for his happiness in every change of situation\\nthat might befall him on his with rather an attempt to\\nreturn the same good will than the power of expressing it\\n\\nwhen i see him again said elinor to herself\\nas the door shut him out i shall see him the husband\\nof lucy\\n\\nand with this pleasing anticipation she sat down\\nto reconsider the past recall the words and endeavour\\nto comprehend all the feelings of edward and of course\\nto reflect on her own with discontent\\n\\nwhen mrs jennings came home though she returned\\nfrom seeing people whom she had never seen before\\nand of whom therefore she must have a great deal to say\\nher mind was so much more occupied by the important secret\\nin her possession than by anything else that she\\nreverted to it again as soon as elinor appeared\\n\\nwell my dear she cried i sent you up to the\\nyoung man  did not i do rightand i suppose you had\\nno great difficultyyou did not find him very unwilling\\nto accept your proposal\\n\\nno maam that was not very likely\\n\\nwell and how soon will he be readyfor it seems\\nall to depend upon that\\n\\nreally said elinor i know so little of these kind\\nof forms that i can hardly even conjecture as to the time\\nor the preparation necessary but i suppose two or three\\nmonths will complete his ordination\\n\\ntwo or three months cried mrs jennings lord my dear\\nhow calmly you talk of it and can the colonel wait two\\nor three months lord bless mei am sure it would put me\\nquite out of patienceand though one would be very glad\\nto do a kindness by poor mr ferrars i do think it is\\nnot worth while to wait two or three months for him\\nsure somebody else might be found that would do as well\\nsomebody that is in orders already\\n\\nmy dear maam said elinor what can you be thinking of\\nwhy colonel brandons only object is to be of use to mr ferrars\\n\\nlord bless you my dearsure you do not mean to persuade\\nme that the colonel only marries you for the sake of giving\\nten guineas to mr ferrars\\n\\nthe deception could not continue after this\\nand an explanation immediately took place by which both\\ngained considerable amusement for the moment without any\\nmaterial loss of happiness to either for mrs jennings\\nonly exchanged one form of delight for another and still\\nwithout forfeiting her expectation of the first\\n\\naye aye the parsonage is but a small one said she\\nafter the first ebullition of surprise and satisfaction\\nwas over and very likely may be out of repair but to hear\\na man apologising as i thought for a house that to my\\nknowledge has five sitting rooms on the groundfloor and i\\nthink the housekeeper told me could make up fifteen beds\\nand to you too that had been used to live in barton cottage\\nit seems quite ridiculous  but my dear we must\\ntouch up the colonel to do some thing to the parsonage\\nand make it comfortable for them before lucy goes to it\\n\\nbut colonel brandon does not seem to have any idea\\nof the livings being enough to allow them to marry\\n\\nthe colonel is a ninny my dear because he has two\\nthousand ayear himself he thinks that nobody else can marry\\non less  take my word for it that if i am alive i shall\\nbe paying a visit at delaford parsonage before michaelmas\\nand i am sure i shant go if lucy ant there\\n\\nelinor was quite of her opinion as to the probability\\nof their not waiting for any thing more\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 41\\n\\n\\nedward having carried his thanks to colonel brandon\\nproceeded with his happiness to lucy and such was the\\nexcess of it by the time he reached bartletts buildings\\nthat she was able to assure mrs jennings who called\\non her again the next day with her congratulations\\nthat she had never seen him in such spirits before\\nin her life\\n\\nher own happiness and her own spirits were at\\nleast very certain and she joined mrs jennings most\\nheartily in her expectation of their being all comfortably\\ntogether in delaford parsonage before michaelmas\\nso far was she at the same time from any backwardness\\nto give elinor that credit which edward would give her\\nthat she spoke of her friendship for them both with the most\\ngrateful warmth was ready to own all their obligation\\nto her and openly declared that no exertion for their\\ngood on miss dashwoods part either present or future\\nwould ever surprise her for she believed her capable of\\ndoing any thing in the world for those she really valued\\nas for colonel brandon she was not only ready to worship\\nhim as a saint but was moreover truly anxious that\\nhe should be treated as one in all worldly concerns\\nanxious that his tithes should be raised to the utmost\\nand scarcely resolved to avail herself at delaford\\nas far as she possibly could of his servants his carriage\\nhis cows and his poultry\\n\\nit was now above a week since john dashwood had\\ncalled in berkeley street and as since that time no notice\\nhad been taken by them of his wifes indisposition\\nbeyond one verbal enquiry elinor began to feel it\\nnecessary to pay her a visitthis was an obligation\\nhowever which not only opposed her own inclination\\nbut which had not the assistance of any encouragement\\nfrom her companions  marianne not contented with\\nabsolutely refusing to go herself was very urgent\\nto prevent her sisters going at all and mrs jennings\\nthough her carriage was always at elinors service\\nso very much disliked mrs john dashwood that not even her\\ncuriosity to see how she looked after the late discovery\\nnor her strong desire to affront her by taking edwards part\\ncould overcome her unwillingness to be in her company again\\nthe consequence was that elinor set out by herself\\nto pay a visit for which no one could really have\\nless inclination and to run the risk of a teteatete\\nwith a woman whom neither of the others had so much\\nreason to dislike\\n\\nmrs dashwood was denied but before the carriage could\\nturn from the house her husband accidentally came out\\nhe expressed great pleasure in meeting elinor told her\\nthat he had been just going to call in berkeley street\\nand assuring her that fanny would be very glad to see her\\ninvited her to come in\\n\\nthey walked up stairs in to the drawingroomnobody was there\\n\\nfanny is in her own room i suppose said hei\\nwill go to her presently for i am sure she will not\\nhave the least objection in the world to seeing you\\nvery far from it indeed  now especially there\\ncannot bebut however you and marianne were always\\ngreat favouriteswhy would not marianne come\\n\\nelinor made what excuse she could for her\\n\\ni am not sorry to see you alone he replied\\nfor i have a good deal to say to you  this living\\nof colonel brandonscan it be truehas he really given\\nit to edwardi heard it yesterday by chance and was\\ncoming to you on purpose to enquire farther about it\\n\\nit is perfectly truecolonel brandon has given\\nthe living of delaford to edward\\n\\nreallywell this is very astonishingno\\nrelationshipno connection between themand now\\nthat livings fetch such a pricewhat was the value of this\\n\\nabout two hundred a year\\n\\nvery welland for the next presentation to a living\\nof that valuesupposing the late incumbent to have\\nbeen old and sickly and likely to vacate it soonhe\\nmight have got i dare sayfourteen hundred pounds\\nand how came he not to have settled that matter before this\\npersons deathnow indeed it would be too late to sell it\\nbut a man of colonel brandons sensei wonder he should\\nbe so improvident in a point of such common such natural\\nconcernwell i am convinced that there is a vast deal\\nof inconsistency in almost every human character  i suppose\\nhoweveron recollectionthat the case may probably be this\\nedward is only to hold the living till the person to whom\\nthe colonel has really sold the presentation is old enough\\nto take itaye aye that is the fact depend upon it\\n\\nelinor contradicted it however very positively\\nand by relating that she had herself been employed\\nin conveying the offer from colonel brandon to edward\\nand therefore must understand the terms on which it\\nwas given obliged him to submit to her authority\\n\\nit is truly astonishinghe cried after hearing\\nwhat she saidwhat could be the colonels motive\\n\\na very simple oneto be of use to mr ferrars\\n\\nwell well whatever colonel brandon may be\\nedward is a very lucky manyou will not mention the matter\\nto fanny however for though i have broke it to her\\nand she bears it vastly wellshe will not like to hear\\nit much talked of\\n\\nelinor had some difficulty here to refrain from observing\\nthat she thought fanny might have borne with composure\\nan acquisition of wealth to her brother by which neither\\nshe nor her child could be possibly impoverished\\n\\nmrs ferrars added he lowering his voice to the\\ntone becoming so important a subject knows nothing\\nabout it at present and i believe it will be best to\\nkeep it entirely concealed from her as long as may be\\nwhen the marriage takes place i fear she must hear\\nof it all\\n\\nbut why should such precaution be usedthough\\nit is not to be supposed that mrs ferrars can have\\nthe smallest satisfaction in knowing that her son has\\nmoney enough to live uponfor that must be quite\\nout of the question yet why upon her late behaviour\\nis she supposed to feel at allshe has done with her\\nson she cast him off for ever and has made all those\\nover whom she had any influence cast him off likewise\\nsurely after doing so she cannot be imagined liable\\nto any impression of sorrow or of joy on his account\\nshe cannot be interested in any thing that befalls him\\nshe would not be so weak as to throw away the comfort\\nof a child and yet retain the anxiety of a parent\\n\\nah elinor said john your reasoning is very good\\nbut it is founded on ignorance of human nature\\nwhen edwards unhappy match takes place depend upon it\\nhis mother will feel as much as if she had never discarded him\\nand therefore every circumstance that may accelerate that\\ndreadful event must be concealed from her as much as possible\\nmrs ferrars can never forget that edward is her son\\n\\nyou surprise me i should think it must nearly\\nhave escaped her memory by this time\\n\\nyou wrong her exceedingly  mrs ferrars is one\\nof the most affectionate mothers in the world\\n\\nelinor was silent\\n\\nwe think nowsaid mr dashwood after a short pause\\nof roberts marrying miss morton\\n\\nelinor smiling at the grave and decisive importance\\nof her brothers tone calmly replied\\n\\nthe lady i suppose has no choice in the affair\\n\\nchoicehow do you mean\\n\\ni only mean that i suppose from your manner\\nof speaking it must be the same to miss morton whether\\nshe marry edward or robert\\n\\ncertainly there can be no difference for robert\\nwill now to all intents and purposes be considered\\nas the eldest sonand as to any thing else they are\\nboth very agreeable young men i do not know that one\\nis superior to the other\\n\\nelinor said no more and john was also for a short\\ntime silenthis reflections ended thus\\n\\nof one thing my dear sister kindly taking her hand\\nand speaking in an awful whisperi may assure you\\nand i will do it because i know it must gratify you\\ni have good reason to thinkindeed i have it from the\\nbest authority or i should not repeat it for otherwise\\nit would be very wrong to say any thing about itbut\\ni have it from the very best authoritynot that i ever\\nprecisely heard mrs ferrars say it herselfbut her\\ndaughter did and i have it from herthat in short\\nwhatever objections there might be against a certaina\\ncertain connectionyou understand meit would have been\\nfar preferable to her it would not have given her half\\nthe vexation that this does  i was exceedingly pleased\\nto hear that mrs ferrars considered it in that light\\na very gratifying circumstance you know to us all\\nit would have been beyond comparison she said the least\\nevil of the two and she would be glad to compound now\\nfor nothing worse but however all that is quite out\\nof the questionnot to be thought of or mentioned\\nas to any attachment you knowit never could beall\\nthat is gone by  but i thought i would just tell you\\nof this because i knew how much it must please you\\nnot that you have any reason to regret my dear elinor  there\\nis no doubt of your doing exceedingly wellquite as well\\nor better perhaps all things considered  has colonel\\nbrandon been with you lately\\n\\nelinor had heard enough if not to gratify her vanity\\nand raise her selfimportance to agitate her nerves\\nand fill her mindand she was therefore glad to be\\nspared from the necessity of saying much in reply herself\\nand from the danger of hearing any thing more from\\nher brother by the entrance of mr robert ferrars\\nafter a few moments chat john dashwood recollecting that\\nfanny was yet uninformed of her sisters being there\\nquitted the room in quest of her and elinor was left\\nto improve her acquaintance with robert who by the\\ngay unconcern the happy selfcomplacency of his manner\\nwhile enjoying so unfair a division of his mothers love\\nand liberality to the prejudice of his banished brother\\nearned only by his own dissipated course of life and that\\nbrothers integrity was confirming her most unfavourable\\nopinion of his head and heart\\n\\nthey had scarcely been two minutes by themselves\\nbefore he began to speak of edward for he too had heard\\nof the living and was very inquisitive on the subject\\nelinor repeated the particulars of it as she had given them\\nto john and their effect on robert though very different\\nwas not less striking than it had been on him  he laughed\\nmost immoderately  the idea of edwards being a clergyman\\nand living in a small parsonagehouse diverted him\\nbeyond measureand when to that was added the fanciful\\nimagery of edward reading prayers in a white surplice\\nand publishing the banns of marriage between john smith and\\nmary brown he could conceive nothing more ridiculous\\n\\nelinor while she waited in silence and immovable\\ngravity the conclusion of such folly could not restrain\\nher eyes from being fixed on him with a look that spoke\\nall the contempt it excited  it was a look however\\nvery well bestowed for it relieved her own feelings and gave\\nno intelligence to him  he was recalled from wit to wisdom\\nnot by any reproof of hers but by his own sensibility\\n\\nwe may treat it as a joke said he at last\\nrecovering from the affected laugh which had considerably\\nlengthened out the genuine gaiety of the momentbut upon\\nmy soul it is a most serious business  poor edward\\nhe is ruined for ever  i am extremely sorry for it\\nfor i know him to be a very goodhearted creature as\\nwellmeaning a fellow perhaps as any in the world\\nyou must not judge of him miss dashwood from your\\nslight acquaintancepoor edwardhis manners are certainly\\nnot the happiest in naturebut we are not all born\\nyou know with the same powersthe same address\\npoor fellowto see him in a circle of strangers\\nto be sure it was pitiable enoughbut upon my soul\\ni believe he has as good a heart as any in the kingdom\\nand i declare and protest to you i never was so shocked in my\\nlife as when it all burst forth  i could not believe it\\nmy mother was the first person who told me of it\\nand i feeling myself called on to act with resolution\\nimmediately said to her my dear madam i do not know\\nwhat you may intend to do on the occasion but as for myself\\ni must say that if edward does marry this young woman\\ni never will see him again that was what i said immediately\\ni was most uncommonly shocked indeedpoor edwardhe has\\ndone for himself completelyshut himself out for ever from\\nall decent societybut as i directly said to my mother\\ni am not in the least surprised at it from his style\\nof education it was always to be expected  my poor mother\\nwas half frantic\\n\\nhave you ever seen the lady\\n\\nyes once while she was staying in this house\\ni happened to drop in for ten minutes and i saw\\nquite enough of her  the merest awkward country girl\\nwithout style or elegance and almost without beauty\\ni remember her perfectly  just the kind of girl i\\nshould suppose likely to captivate poor edward\\ni offered immediately as soon as my mother related\\nthe affair to me to talk to him myself and dissuade\\nhim from the match but it was too late then i found\\nto do any thing for unluckily i was not in the way\\nat first and knew nothing of it till after the breach\\nhad taken place when it was not for me you know\\nto interfere  but had i been informed of it a few\\nhours earlieri think it is most probablethat something\\nmight have been hit on  i certainly should have represented\\nit to edward in a very strong light  my dear fellow\\ni should have said consider what you are doing\\nyou are making a most disgraceful connection and such a one\\nas your family are unanimous in disapproving i cannot\\nhelp thinking in short that means might have been found\\nbut now it is all too late  he must be starved you know\\nthat is certain absolutely starved\\n\\nhe had just settled this point with great composure\\nwhen the entrance of mrs john dashwood put an end to the\\nsubject\\nbut though she never spoke of it out of her own family\\nelinor could see its influence on her mind in the something\\nlike confusion of countenance with which she entered\\nand an attempt at cordiality in her behaviour to herself\\nshe even proceeded so far as to be concerned to find\\nthat elinor and her sister were so soon to leave town\\nas she had hoped to see more of theman exertion\\nin which her husband who attended her into the room\\nand hung enamoured over her accents seemed to distinguish\\nevery thing that was most affectionate and graceful\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 42\\n\\n\\none other short

only eighty\\nmiles from barton and not thirty from combe magna\\nand before she had been five minutes within its walls\\nwhile the others were busily helping charlotte to show\\nher child to the housekeeper she quitted it again\\nstealing away through the winding shrubberies now just\\nbeginning to be in beauty to gain a distant eminence\\nwhere from its grecian temple her eye wandering over\\na wide tract of country to the southeast could fondly\\nrest on the farthest ridge of hills in the horizon\\nand fancy that from their summits combe magna might be seen\\n\\nin such moments of

wandering from place to place in free and luxurious solitude\\nshe resolved to spend almost every hour of every day\\nwhile she remained with the palmers in the indulgence of\\nsuch solitary rambles\\n\\nshe returned just in time to join the others\\nas they quitted the house on an excursion through its\\nmore immediate premises and the rest of the morning was\\neasily whiled away in lounging round the kitchen garden\\nexamining the bloom upon its walls and listening to the\\ngardeners lamentations upon blights in dawdling through\\nthe greenhouse where the loss of her favourite plants\\nunwarily exposed and nipped by the lingering frost\\nraised the laughter of charlotteand in visiting her\\npoultryyard where in the disappointed hopes of her\\ndairymaid by hens forsaking

a few miles\\non the other side of bath whither her husband promised\\nat her earnest entreaty to join her in a day or two\\nand whither she was almost equally urgent with her\\nmother to accompany

produced little or no alteration in the\\nstate of the patient she certainly was not better and\\nexcept that there was no amendment did not appear worse\\ntheir party was now farther reduced for mr palmer\\nthough very unwilling to go as well from real humanity\\nand goodnature as from a dislike of appearing to be\\nfrightened away by his wife was persuaded at last\\nby colonel brandon to perform his promise of following her\\nand while he was preparing to go colonel brandon himself\\nwith a much greater exertion began to talk of going\\nlikewisehere however the kindness of mrs jennings\\ninterposed most acceptably for to send the colonel away\\nwhile his love was in so much uneasiness on her sisters\\naccount would be to deprive them both she thought\\nof every comfort and therefore telling him at once\\nthat his stay at cleveland was necessary to herself\\nthat she should want him to play at piquet of an evening\\nwhile miss dashwood was above with her sister c she\\nurged him so strongly to remain that he who was gratifying\\nthe first wish of his own heart by a compliance could not\\nlong even affect to demur especially as mrs jenningss\\nentreaty was warmly seconded by mr palmer who seemed\\nto feel a relief to himself in leaving behind him a person\\nso well able to assist or advise miss dashwood in any emergence\\n\\nmarianne was of course kept in ignorance of all\\nthese arrangements  she knew not that she had been\\nthe means of sending the owners of cleveland away\\nin about seven days from the time of their arrival\\nit gave her no surprise that she saw nothing\\nof mrs palmer and as it gave her likewise no concern\\nshe never mentioned her name\\n\\ntwo days passed away from the time of mr palmers departure\\nand her situation continued with little variation\\nthe same  mr harris who attended her every day\\nstill talked boldly of a speedy recovery and miss dashwood\\nwas equally sanguine but the expectation of the others\\nwas by no means so cheerful  mrs jennings had determined\\nvery early in the seizure that marianne would never\\nget over it and colonel brandon who was chiefly\\nof use in listening to mrs jenningss forebodings\\nwas not in a state of mind to resist their influence\\nhe tried to reason himself out of fears which the different\\njudgment of the apothecary seemed to render absurd\\nbut the many hours of each day in which he was left\\nentirely alone were but too favourable for the admission\\nof every melancholy idea and he could not expel from\\nhis mind the persuasion that he should see marianne no more\\n\\non the morning of the third day however the gloomy\\nanticipations of both were almost done away for when\\nmr harris arrived he declared his patient materially better\\nher pulse was much stronger and every symptom more favourable\\nthan on the preceding visit  elinor confirmed in every\\npleasant hope was all cheerfulness rejoicing that\\nin her letters to her mother she had pursued her own\\njudgment rather than her friends in making very light\\nof the indisposition which delayed them at cleveland\\nand almost fixing on the time when marianne would be\\nable to travel\\n\\nbut the day did not close so auspiciously as it began\\ntowards the evening marianne became ill again growing\\nmore heavy restless and uncomfortable than before\\nher sister however still sanguine was willing to\\nattribute the change to nothing more than the fatigue\\nof having sat up to have her bed made and carefully\\nadministering the cordials prescribed saw her with\\nsatisfaction sink at last into a slumber from which\\nshe expected the most beneficial effects  her sleep\\nthough not so quiet as elinor wished to see it\\nlasted a considerable time and anxious to observe\\nthe result of it herself she resolved to sit with her\\nduring the whole of it  mrs jennings knowing nothing\\nof any change in the patient went unusually early to bed\\nher maid who was one of the principal nurses was recreating\\nherself in the housekeepers room and elinor remained\\nalone with marianne\\n\\nthe repose of the latter became more and more disturbed\\nand her sister who watched with unremitting attention\\nher continual change of posture and heard the frequent\\nbut inarticulate sounds of complaint which passed her lips\\nwas almost wishing to rouse her from so painful a slumber\\nwhen marianne suddenly awakened by some accidental noise\\nin the house started hastily up and with feverish wildness\\ncried out\\n\\nis mama coming\\n\\nnot yet cried the other concealing her terror\\nand assisting marianne to lie down again but she will\\nbe here i hope before it is long  it is a great way\\nyou know from hence to barton\\n\\nbut she must not go round by london cried marianne\\nin the same hurried manner  i shall never see her\\nif she goes by london\\n\\nelinor perceived with alarm that she was not\\nquite herself and while attempting to soothe her\\neagerly felt her pulse  it was lower and quicker than ever\\nand marianne still talking wildly of mama her alarm\\nincreased so rapidly as to determine her on sending\\ninstantly for mr harris and despatching a messenger\\nto barton for her mother  to consult with colonel brandon\\non the best means of effecting the latter was a thought\\nwhich immediately followed the resolution of its performance\\nand as soon she had rung up the maid to take her place\\nby her sister she hastened down to the drawingroom\\nwhere she knew he was generally to be found at a much\\nlater hour than the present\\n\\nit was no time for hesitation  her fears and her\\ndifficulties were immediately before him  her fears\\nhe had no courage no confidence to attempt the removal of\\nhe listened to them in silent despondencebut her\\ndifficulties were instantly obviated for with a readiness\\nthat seemed to speak the occasion and the service\\nprearranged in his mind he offered himself as the\\nmessenger who should fetch mrs dashwood  elinor made no\\nresistance that was not easily overcome  she thanked him\\nwith brief though fervent gratitude and while he went\\nto hurry off his servant with a message to mr harris and\\nan order for posthorses directly she wrote a few lines\\nto her mother\\n\\nthe comfort of such a friend at that moment as colonel\\nbrandonor such a companion for her motherhow gratefully\\nwas it felta companion whose judgment would guide\\nwhose attendance must relieve and whose friendship might\\nsoothe heras far as the shock of such a summons could\\nbe lessened to her his presence his manners his assistance\\nwould lessen it\\n\\nhe meanwhile whatever he might feel acted with all\\nthe firmness of a collected mind made every necessary\\narrangement with the utmost despatch and calculated\\nwith exactness the time in which she might look for\\nhis return  not a moment was lost in delay of any kind\\nthe horses arrived even before they were expected\\nand colonel brandon only pressing her hand with a look\\nof solemnity and a few words spoken too low to reach her ear\\nhurried into the carriage  it was then about twelve\\noclock and she returned to her sisters apartment to wait\\nfor the arrival of the apothecary and to watch by her\\nthe rest of the night  it was a night of almost equal\\nsuffering to both  hour after hour passed away in sleepless\\npain and delirium on mariannes side and in the most\\ncruel anxiety on elinors before mr harris appeared\\nher apprehensions once raised paid by their excess for all\\nher former security and the servant who sat up with her\\nfor she would not allow mrs jennings to be called\\nonly tortured her more by hints of what her mistress\\nhad always thought\\n\\nmariannes ideas were still at intervals\\nfixed incoherently on her mother and whenever she\\nmentioned her name it gave a pang to the heart of\\npoor elinor who reproaching herself for having trifled\\nwith so many days of illness and wretched for some\\nimmediate relief fancied that all relief might soon\\nbe in vain that every thing had been delayed too long\\nand pictured to herself her suffering mother arriving\\ntoo late to see this darling child or to see her rational\\n\\nshe was on the point of sending again for mr harris\\nor if he could not come for some other advice\\nwhen the formerbut not till after five oclockarrived\\nhis opinion however made some little amends for his delay\\nfor though acknowledging a very unexpected and unpleasant\\nalteration in his patient he would not allow the danger\\nto be material and talked of the relief which a fresh\\nmode of treatment must procure with a confidence which\\nin a lesser degree was communicated to elinor  he promised\\nto call again in the course of three or four hours\\nand left both the patient and her anxious attendant more\\ncomposed than he had found them\\n\\nwith strong concern and with many reproaches for not\\nbeing called to their aid did mrs jennings hear in the\\nmorning of what had passed  her former apprehensions\\nnow with greater reason restored left her no doubt of\\nthe event and though trying to speak comfort to elinor\\nher conviction of her sisters danger would not allow her\\nto offer the comfort of hope  her heart was really grieved\\nthe rapid decay the early death of a girl so young\\nso lovely as marianne must have struck a less interested\\nperson with concern  on mrs jenningss compassion\\nshe had other claims  she had been for three months\\nher companion was still under her care and she was\\nknown to have been greatly injured and long unhappy\\nthe distress of her sister too particularly a favourite\\nwas before herand as for their mother when mrs jennings\\nconsidered that marianne might probably be to her what\\ncharlotte was to herself her sympathy in her sufferings\\nwas very sincere\\n\\nmr harris was punctual in his second visit\\nbut he came to be disappointed in his hopes of what the\\nlast would produce  his medicines had failedthe fever\\nwas unabated and marianne only more quietnot more\\nherselfremained in a heavy stupor  elinor catching all\\nand more than all his fears in a moment proposed to call\\nin further advice  but he judged it unnecessary he had\\nstill something more to try some more fresh application\\nof whose success he was as confident as the last and his\\nvisit concluded with encouraging assurances which reached\\nthe ear but could not enter the heart of miss dashwood\\nshe was calm except when she thought of her mother\\nbut she was almost hopeless and in this state she continued\\ntill noon scarcely stirring from her sisters bed\\nher thoughts wandering from one image of grief\\none suffering friend to another and her spirits oppressed\\nto the utmost by the conversation of mrs jennings\\nwho scrupled not to attribute the severity and danger\\nof this attack to the many weeks of previous indisposition\\nwhich mariannes disappointment had brought on\\nelinor felt all the reasonableness of the idea and it\\ngave fresh misery to her reflections\\n\\nabout noon however she beganbut with a cautiona\\ndread of disappointment which for some time kept her silent\\neven to her friendto fancy to hope she could perceive\\na slight amendment in her sisters pulseshe waited\\nwatched and examined it again and againand at last\\nwith an agitation more difficult to bury under exterior calmness\\nthan all her foregoing distress ventured to communicate\\nher hopes  mrs jennings though forced on examination\\nto acknowledge a temporary revival tried to keep her\\nyoung friend from indulging a thought of its continuance\\nand elinor conning over every injunction of distrust\\ntold herself likewise not to hope  but it was too late\\nhope had already entered and feeling all its anxious flutter\\nshe bent over her sister to watchshe hardly knew for what\\nhalf an hour passed away and the favourable symptom\\nyet blessed her  others even arose to confirm it\\nher breath her skin her lips all flattered elinor\\nwith signs of amendment and marianne fixed her eyes on\\nher with a rational though languid gaze  anxiety and\\nhope now oppressed her in equal degrees and left her no\\nmoment of tranquillity till the arrival of mr harris at\\nfour oclockwhen his assurances his felicitations on\\na recovery in her sister even surpassing his expectation\\ngave her confidence comfort and tears of joy\\n\\nmarianne was in every respect materially better\\nand he declared her entirely out of danger  mrs jennings\\nperhaps satisfied with the partial justification of her\\nforebodings which had been found in their late alarm\\nallowed herself to trust in his judgment and admitted\\nwith unfeigned joy and soon with unequivocal cheerfulness\\nthe probability of an entire recovery\\n\\nelinor could not be cheerful  her joy was of a\\ndifferent kind and led to any thing rather than to gaiety\\nmarianne restored to life health friends and to her\\ndoting mother was an idea to fill her heart with sensations\\nof exquisite comfort and expand it in fervent gratitude\\nbut it lead to no outward demonstrations of joy no words\\nno smiles  all within elinors breast was satisfaction\\nsilent and strong\\n\\nshe continued by the side of her sister with little\\nintermission the whole afternoon calming every fear\\nsatisfying every inquiry of her enfeebled spirits\\nsupplying every succour and watching almost every look and\\nevery breath  the possibility of a relapse would of course\\nin some moments occur to remind her of what anxiety was\\nbut when she saw on her frequent and minute examination\\nthat every symptom of recovery continued and saw marianne\\nat six oclock sink into a quiet steady and to all\\nappearance comfortable sleep she silenced every doubt\\n\\nthe time was now drawing on when colonel brandon\\nmight be expected back  at ten oclock she trusted\\nor at least not much later her mother would be relieved\\nfrom the dreadful suspense in which she must now be\\ntravelling towards them  the colonel tooperhaps scarcely\\nless an object of pityohhow slow was the progress\\nof time which yet kept them in ignorance\\n\\nat seven oclock leaving marianne still sweetly asleep\\nshe joined mrs jennings in the drawingroom to tea\\nof breakfast she had been kept by her fears and of\\ndinner by their sudden reverse from eating much\\nand the present refreshment therefore with such feelings\\nof content as she brought to it was particularly welcome\\nmrs jennings would have persuaded her at its conclusion\\nto take some rest before her mothers arrival and allow her to\\ntake her place by marianne but elinor had no sense of fatigue\\nno capability of sleep at that moment about her and she was\\nnot to be kept away from her sister an unnecessary instant\\nmrs jennings therefore attending her up stairs into the\\nsick chamber to satisfy herself that all continued right\\nleft her there again to her charge and her thoughts\\nand retired to her own room to write letters and sleep\\n\\nthe night was cold and stormy  the wind roared\\nround the house and the rain beat against the windows\\nbut elinor all happiness within regarded it not\\nmarianne slept through every blast and the travellers\\nthey had a rich reward in store for every present inconvenience\\n\\nthe clock struck eight  had it been ten\\nelinor would have been convinced that at that moment\\nshe heard a carriage driving up to the house\\nand so strong was the persuasion that she did in spite\\nof the almost impossibility of their being already come\\nthat she moved into the adjoining dressingcloset and\\nopened a window shutter to be satisfied of the truth\\nshe instantly saw that her ears had not deceived her\\nthe flaring lamps of a carriage were immediately in view\\nby their uncertain light she thought she could discern it\\nto be drawn by four horses and this while it told the\\nexcess of her poor mothers alarm gave some explanation\\nto such unexpected rapidity\\n\\nnever in her life had elinor found it so difficult\\nto be calm as at that moment  the knowledge of what her\\nmother must be feeling as the carriage stopt at the door\\nof her doubther dreadperhaps her despairand\\nof what she had to tellwith such knowledge it was\\nimpossible to be calm  all that remained to be done\\nwas to be speedy and therefore staying only till\\nshe could leave mrs jenningss maid with her sister\\nshe hurried down stairs\\n\\nthe bustle in the vestibule as she passed along\\nan inner lobby assured her that they were already\\nin the house  she rushed to the drawingroomshe\\nentered itand saw only

that\\nprudence required dispatch and that her acquiescence would\\nbest promote it she walked silently towards the table\\nand sat down  he took the opposite chair and for half\\na minute not a word

the habit of indulging i endeavoured by every means\\nin my power to make myself pleasing to her without any\\ndesign of returning her affection\\n\\nmiss dashwood at this point turning her eyes on

my old cousin mrs smith was to set me free\\nyet that event being uncertain and possibly far distant\\nit had been for some time my intention to reestablish my\\ncircumstances by marrying a woman of

can ever reprobate too muchi was acting\\nin this manner trying to engage her regard without a\\nthought of returning itbut one thing may be said\\nfor me even in that horrid state of selfish vanity\\ni did not know the extent of the injury i meditated\\nbecause i did not then know what it was to love\\nbut have i ever known itwell may it be doubted for had i\\nreally loved could i have sacrificed my feelings to vanity\\nto avariceor what is more could i have sacrificed hers\\nbut i have done it  to avoid a comparative poverty\\nwhich her affection and her society would have deprived\\nof all its horrors i have by raising myself to affluence\\nlost every thing that could make it a blessing\\n\\nyou did then said elinor a little softened\\nbelieve yourself at one time

her and the happiest hours of my life\\nwere what i spent with her when i felt my intentions\\nwere strictly honourable and my feelings blameless\\neven then however when fully determined on

marianne\\nintending by that to preserve myself from her farther notice\\nand for some time i was even determined not to call in\\nberkeley streetbut at last judging it wiser to affect\\nthe air of a cool common acquaintance than anything else\\ni watched you all safely out of the house one morning\\nand left my name\\n\\nwatched us out of the house\\n\\neven so  you would be surprised to hear how often\\ni watched you how often i was on the point of falling\\nin with you  i have entered many a shop to avoid your sight\\nas the carriage drove by  lodging as i did in bond street\\nthere was hardly a day in which i did not catch a glimpse\\nof one or other of you and nothing but the most constant\\nwatchfulness on my side a most invariably prevailing\\ndesire to keep out of your sight could have separated us\\nso long  i avoided the middletons as much as possible\\nas well as everybody else who was likely to prove\\nan acquaintance in common  not aware of their being\\nin town however i blundered on sir john i believe\\nthe first day of his coming and the day after i had called\\nat mrs jenningss  he asked me to a party a dance at his\\nhouse in the eveninghad he not told me as an inducement\\nthat you and your sister were to be there i should have\\nfelt it too certain a thing to trust myself near him\\nthe next morning brought another short note from marianne\\nstill affectionate open artless confidingeverything\\nthat could make my conduct most hateful  i could not\\nanswer it  i triedbut could not frame a sentence\\nbut i thought of her i believe every moment of the day\\nif you can pity me miss dashwood pity my situation as it\\nwas then  with my head and heart full of your sister\\ni was forced to play the happy lover to another womanthose\\nthree or four weeks were worse than all  well at last\\nas i need not tell you you were forced on me and what a\\nsweet figure i cutwhat an evening of agony it was\\nmarianne beautiful as an angel on one side calling me\\nwilloughby in such a toneoh godholding out her hand\\nto me asking me for an explanation with those bewitching\\neyes fixed in such speaking solicitude on my faceand\\nsophia jealous as the devil on the other hand looking\\nall that waswell it does not signify it is over now\\nsuch an eveningi ran away from you all as soon as i could\\nbut not before i had seen mariannes sweet face as white\\nas deaththat was the last last look i ever had of her\\nthe last manner in which she appeared to me  it was a horrid\\nsightyet when i thought of her today as really dying\\nit was a kind of comfort to me to imagine that i knew\\nexactly how she would appear to those who saw her last\\nin this world  she was before me constantly before me\\nas i travelled in the same look and hue\\n\\na short pause of mutual thoughtfulness succeeded\\nwilloughby first rousing himself broke it thus\\n\\nwell let me make haste and be gone  your sister\\nis certainly better certainly out of

it happened to catch\\nsophias eye before it caught mineand its size\\nthe elegance of the paper the handwriting altogether\\nimmediately gave her a suspicion  some vague report had\\nreached her

indignation against me and concern\\nfor your sister could not resist the temptation of telling\\nme what he knew ought tothough probably he did not\\nthink it wouldvex me horridly  as bluntly as he could\\nspeak it therefore he told me that marianne dashwood\\nwas dying of a putrid fever at clevelanda letter that\\nmorning received from mrs jennings declared her danger\\nmost imminentthe palmers

against feeling against every better interest\\nhe had outwardly torn himself now when no longer allowable\\ngoverned every thought and the connection for the sake\\nof which he had with little

worthless of men willoughby in spite\\nof all his faults excited a degree of commiseration\\nfor the sufferings produced by them which made her\\nthink of him as now separated for ever from her family\\nwith a tenderness a regret rather in proportion as she\\nsoon acknowledged within herselfto his wishes than to\\nhis merits  she felt that his influence over her mind\\nwas heightened by circumstances which ought not in reason\\nto have weight by that person of uncommon attraction\\nthat open affectionate and lively manner which it\\nwas no merit to possess and by that still ardent love\\nfor marianne which it was not even innocent to indulge\\nbut she felt that it was so long long before she could\\nfeel his influence less\\n\\nwhen at last she returned to the unconscious marianne\\nshe found her just awaking refreshed by so long and sweet\\na sleep to the extent of her hopes  elinors heart was full\\nthe past the present the future willoughbys visit\\nmariannes safety and her mothers expected arrival\\nthrew her altogether into an agitation of spirits\\nwhich kept off every indication of fatigue and made\\nher only fearful of betraying herself to her sister\\nshort was the time however in which that fear could\\naffect her for within half an hour after willoughbys\\nleaving the house she was again called down stairs\\nby the sound of another carriageeager to save her\\nmother from every unnecessary moments horrible suspense\\nshe ran immediately into the hall and reached the outward\\ndoor just in time to receive and support her as she entered it\\n\\nmrs dashwood whose terror as they drew near the\\nhouse had produced almost the conviction of mariannes\\nbeing no more had no voice to inquire after her\\nno voice even for elinor but she waiting neither for\\nsalutation nor inquiry instantly gave the joyful relief\\nand her mother catching it with all her usual warmth\\nwas in a moment as much overcome by her happiness as she\\nhad been before by her fears  she was supported into\\nthe drawingroom between her daughter and her friend\\nand there shedding tears of joy though still unable\\nto speak embraced elinor again and again turning from her\\nat intervals to press colonel brandons hand with a look\\nwhich spoke at once her gratitude and her conviction\\nof his sharing with herself in the bliss of the moment\\nhe shared it however in a silence even greater than her own\\n\\nas soon as mrs dashwood had recovered herself\\nto see marianne was her first desire and in two minutes she\\nwas with her beloved child rendered dearer to her than ever\\nby absence unhappiness and danger  elinors delight\\nas she saw what each felt in the meeting was only checked\\nby an apprehension of its robbing marianne of farther sleep\\nbut mrs

submitted readily to the\\nsilence and quiet prescribed by every nurse around her\\nmrs dashwood would sit up with her all night and elinor\\nin compliance with her mothers entreaty went to bed\\nbut the rest which one night entirely sleepless\\nand many hours of the most wearing anxiety seemed to\\nmake requisite was kept off by irritation of spirits\\nwilloughby poor willoughby as she now allowed\\nherself to call him was constantly in her thoughts she\\nwould not but have heard his vindication for the world\\nand now blamed now acquitted herself for having judged him\\nso harshly before  but her promise of relating it to her\\nsister was invariably painful  she dreaded the performance\\nof it dreaded what its effect on marianne might be\\ndoubted whether after such an explanation she could ever\\nbe happy with another and for a moment wished willoughby\\na widower  then remembering colonel brandon reproved herself\\nfelt that to his sufferings and his constancy far more\\nthan to his rivals the reward of her sister was due\\nand wished any thing rather than mrs willoughbys death\\n\\nthe shock of colonel brandons errand at barton had been\\nmuch softened to mrs dashwood by her own previous alarm\\nfor so great was her uneasiness about marianne that she\\nhad already determined to set out for cleveland on that\\nvery day without waiting for any further intelligence\\nand had so far settled her journey before his arrival\\nthat the careys were then expected every moment to fetch\\nmargaret away as her mother was unwilling to take her\\nwhere there might be infection\\n\\nmarianne continued to mend every day and the brilliant\\ncheerfulness of mrs dashwoods looks and spirits proved\\nher to be as she repeatedly declared herself one of\\nthe happiest women in the world  elinor could not hear\\nthe declaration nor witness its proofs without sometimes\\nwondering whether her mother ever recollected edward\\nbut mrs dashwood trusting to the temperate account\\nof her own disappointment which elinor had sent her\\nwas led away by the exuberance of her joy to think only\\nof what would increase it  marianne was restored to her\\nfrom a danger in which as she now began to feel\\nher own mistaken judgment in encouraging the unfortunate\\nattachment to willoughby had contributed to place her\\nand in her recovery she had yet another source of joy\\nunthought of by elinor  it was thus imparted to her\\nas soon as any opportunity of private conference\\nbetween them occurred\\n\\nat last we are alone  my elinor you do not

satisfied that none founded on an impartial\\nconsideration of their age characters or feelings\\ncould be givenbut her mother must always be carried\\naway by her imagination on any interesting

deeply\\nrooted for any change in it under a great length of time\\nand even supposing her heart again free is too diffident\\nof himself to believe that with such a difference of age\\nand disposition he could ever attach her  there however\\nhe is quite mistaken  his age is only so much beyond\\nhers as to be an advantage as to make his character and\\nprinciples fixedand his disposition i am well convinced\\nis exactly the very one to make your sister happy\\nand his person his manners too are all in his favour\\nmy partiality does not blind me he certainly is not\\nso

accordant with her real disposition than\\nthe livelinessoften artificial and often illtimed\\nof the other  i am very sure myself that had willoughby\\nturned out as really amiable as he has proved

request for she was impatient to pour forth\\nher thanks to him for fetching her mother colonel brandon\\nwas invited to visit her\\n\\nhis emotion on entering the room in seeing her altered\\nlooks and in receiving the pale hand which she immediately\\nheld out to him was such as in elinors conjecture\\nmust arise from something more than his affection for marianne\\nor the consciousness of its being known to others\\nand she soon discovered in his melancholy eye and varying\\ncomplexion as he looked at her sister the probable\\nrecurrence of many past scenes of misery to his mind\\nbrought

arrived\\nand marianne after taking so particular and lengthened\\na leave of mrs jennings one so earnestly grateful so full\\nof respect and kind wishes as seemed due to her own heart\\nfrom a secret acknowledgment of past inattention and bidding\\ncolonel brandon farewell with a cordiality of a friend\\nwas carefully assisted by him into the carriage of which he\\nseemed anxious that she should engross at least half\\nmrs dashwood and elinor then followed and the others\\nwere left by themselves to talk of the travellers\\nand feel their own dullness till mrs jennings was summoned\\nto her chaise to take comfort in the gossip of her maid\\nfor the loss of her two young companions and colonel brandon\\nimmediately afterwards took his solitary way to delaford\\n\\nthe dashwoods were two days on the road and marianne\\nbore her journey on both without essential fatigue\\nevery thing that the most zealous affection the most\\nsolicitous care could do to render her comfortable\\nwas the office of each watchful companion and each\\nfound their reward in her bodily ease and her calmness\\nof spirits  to elinor the observation of the latter\\nwas particularly grateful  she who had seen her week\\nafter week so constantly suffering oppressed by anguish\\nof heart which she had neither courage to speak of\\nnor fortitude to conceal now saw with a joy which no other\\ncould equally share an apparent composure of mind which\\nin being the result as she trusted of serious reflection\\nmust eventually lead her to contentment and cheerfulness\\n\\nas they approached barton indeed and entered\\non scenes of which every field and every tree brought\\nsome peculiar some painful recollection she grew silent\\nand thoughtful and turning away her face from their notice\\nsat earnestly gazing through the window  but here\\nelinor could neither wonder nor blame and when she saw\\nas she assisted marianne from the carriage that she\\nhad been crying she saw only an emotion too natural\\nin itself to raise any thing less tender than pity\\nand in its unobtrusiveness entitled to praise  in the\\nwhole of her subsequent manner she traced the direction\\nof a mind awakened to reasonable exertion for no sooner\\nhad they entered their common sittingroom than marianne\\nturned her eyes around it with a look of resolute firmness\\nas if determined at once to accustom herself to the sight\\nof every object with which the remembrance of willoughby could\\nbe connectedshe said little but every sentence aimed\\nat cheerfulness and though a sigh sometimes escaped her\\nit never passed away without the atonement of a smile\\nafter dinner she would try her pianoforte she went to it\\nbut the music on which her eye first rested was an opera\\nprocured for her by willoughby containing some of their\\nfavourite duets and bearing on its outward leaf her own name\\nin his handwritingthat would not doshe shook her head\\nput the music aside and after running over the keys\\nfor a minute complained of feebleness in her fingers\\nand closed the instrument again declaring however with firmness\\nas she did so that she should in future practice much\\n\\nthe next morning produced no abatement in these\\nhappy symptoms  on the contrary with a mind and body\\nalike strengthened by rest she looked and spoke with\\nmore genuine spirit anticipating the pleasure of\\nmargarets return and talking of the dear family party\\nwhich would then be restored of their mutual pursuits\\nand cheerful society as the only happiness worth a wish\\n\\nwhen the weather is settled and i have recovered\\nmy strength said she we will take long walks together\\nevery day  we will walk to the farm at the edge of the down\\nand see how the children go on we will walk to sir

been leading her to the extreme of languid\\nindolence and selfish repining now at work in introducing\\nexcess into a scheme of such rational employment and virtuous\\nselfcontrol her smile however changed to a sigh when she\\nremembered that promise to willoughby was yet unfulfilled\\nand feared she had that to communicate which might again\\nunsettle the mind of marianne and ruin at least for a time\\nthis fair prospect of busy tranquillity  willing therefore\\nto delay the evil hour she resolved to wait till her\\nsisters health were more secure before she appointed it\\nbut the resolution was made only to be broken\\n\\nmarianne had been two or three days at home before\\nthe weather was fine enough for an invalid like herself\\nto venture out  but at last a soft genial morning appeared\\nsuch as might tempt the daughters wishes and the\\nmothers confidence and marianne leaning on elinors arm\\nwas authorised to walk as long as she could without fatigue\\nin the lane before the house\\n\\nthe sisters set out at a pace slow as the feebleness\\nof marianne in an exercise hitherto untried since her\\nillness requiredand they had advanced only so far\\nbeyond the

in which\\nyou would have been poorly supported by an affection\\non his side much less certain  had you married\\nyou must have been always poor  his expensiveness is\\nacknowledged even by himself and his whole conduct declares\\nthat selfdenial is a word hardly understood by him\\nhis demands and your inexperience together on a small\\nvery small income must have brought on distresses which\\nwould not be the less grievous to you from having been\\nentirely unknown and unthought of before  your sense\\nof honour and honesty would have led you i know\\nwhen aware of your situation to attempt all the economy\\nthat would appear to you possible and perhaps as long\\nas your frugality retrenched only on your own comfort\\nyou might have been suffered to practice it but beyond

enjoyments is it not to be feared that instead\\nof prevailing on feelings so selfish to consent to it\\nyou would have lessened your own influence on his heart\\nand made him regret the connection which had involved him\\nin such difficulties\\n\\nmariannes lips quivered and she repeated the word\\nselfish in a tone that implieddo you really think\\nhim selfish\\n\\nthe whole of his behaviour replied elinor\\nfrom the beginning to the end of the affair has been\\ngrounded on selfishness  it was selfishness which first\\nmade him sport with your affections which afterwards\\nwhen his own were engaged made him delay the confession\\nof it and which finally carried him from barton\\nhis own enjoyment or his own ease was in every particular\\nhis ruling principle\\n\\nit is very true  my happiness never was his object\\n\\nat present continued elinor he regrets what he\\nhas done  and why does he regret itbecause he finds\\nit has not answered towards himself  it has not made\\nhim happy  his circumstances are now unembarrassedhe\\nsuffers from no evil of that kind and he thinks only\\nthat he has married a woman of a less amiable temper\\nthan yourself  but does it follow that had he married you\\nhe would have been happythe inconveniences would have\\nbeen different  he would then have suffered under the\\npecuniary distresses which because they are removed\\nhe now reckons as nothing  he would have had a wife\\nof whose temper he could make no complaint but he would\\nhave been always necessitousalways poor and probably\\nwould soon have learned to rank the innumerable comforts\\nof a clear estate and good income as of far more importance\\neven to domestic happiness than the mere temper of a wife\\n\\ni have not a doubt of it said marianne and i\\nhave nothing to regretnothing but my own folly\\n\\nrather say your mothers imprudence my child\\nsaid mrs dashwood she must be answerable\\n\\nmarianne would not let her proceedand elinor\\nsatisfied that

think be fairly drawn from\\nthe whole of the storythat all willoughbys difficulties\\nhave arisen from the first offence against virtue in his\\nbehaviour to eliza williams  that crime has been the origin\\nof every lesser one and of all his present discontents\\n\\nmarianne assented most feelingly to the remark\\nand her mother was led by it to an enumeration of colonel\\nbrandons injuries and

following days that marianne did not continue\\nto gain strength as she had done but while her resolution\\nwas unsubdued and she still tried to appear cheerful\\nand easy her sister could safely

nothing of him since her leaving london\\nnothing new of his plans nothing certain even of his\\npresent abode  some letters had passed between her\\nand her brother in consequence of mariannes illness\\nand in the first of johns there had been this sentence\\nwe know nothing of our unfortunate edward and can make no\\nenquiries on so prohibited a subject but conclude him\\nto be still at oxford which was all the intelligence\\nof edward afforded her by the correspondence for his name\\nwas not even mentioned in any of the succeeding letters\\nshe was not doomed however to be long in ignorance of\\nhis measures\\n\\ntheir manservant had been sent one morning to exeter\\non business and when as he waited at table he had\\nsatisfied the inquiries of his mistress as to the event\\nof his errand this was his voluntary communication\\n\\ni suppose you know maam that mr ferrars is married\\n\\nmarianne gave a violent start fixed her eyes\\nupon elinor saw her turning pale and fell back in her\\nchair in hysterics  mrs dashwood whose eyes as she\\nanswered the servants inquiry had intuitively taken\\nthe same direction was shocked to perceive by elinors\\ncountenance how much she really suffered and a moment\\nafterwards alike distressed by mariannes situation\\nknew not on which child to bestow her principal attention\\n\\nthe servant who saw only that miss marianne was\\ntaken ill had sense enough to call one of the maids\\nwho with mrs dashwoods assistance supported her into\\nthe other room  by that time marianne was rather better\\nand her mother leaving her to the care of margaret\\nand the maid returned to elinor who though still\\nmuch disordered had so far recovered the use of her reason\\nand voice as to be just beginning an inquiry of thomas\\nas to the source of his intelligence  mrs dashwood\\nimmediately took all that trouble on herself and elinor\\nhad the benefit of the information without the exertion\\nof seeking it\\n\\nwho told you that mr ferrars was married thomas\\n\\ni see mr ferrars myself maam this morning\\nin exeter and his lady too miss steele as was  they was\\nstopping in a chaise at the door of the new london inn\\nas i went there with a message from sally at the park\\nto her brother who is one of the postboys i happened\\nto look up as i went by the chaise and so i see directly\\nit was the youngest miss steele so i took off my hat\\nand she knew me and called to me and inquired after you\\nmaam and the young ladies especially miss marianne\\nand bid me i should give her compliments and mr ferrarss\\ntheir best compliments and service and how sorry they\\nwas they had not time to come on and see you but they was\\nin a great hurry to go forwards for they was going further\\ndown for a little while but howsever when they come back\\ntheyd make sure to come and see you\\n\\nbut did she tell you she was married thomas\\n\\nyes maam she smiled and said how she\\nhad changed her name since she was in these parts\\nshe was always a very affable and freespoken young lady\\nand very civil behaved  so i made free to wish her joy\\n\\nwas mr ferrars in the carriage with her\\n\\nyes maam i just see him leaning back in it\\nbut he did not look uphe never was a gentleman much\\nfor talking\\n\\nelinors heart could easily account for his not\\nputting himself forward and mrs dashwood probably\\nfound the same explanation\\n\\nwas there no one else in the carriage\\n\\nno maam only they two\\n\\ndo you know where they came from\\n\\nthey come straight from town as miss lucy\\nmrs ferrars told me\\n\\nand are they going farther westward\\n\\nyes maambut not to bide long  they will soon\\nbe back again and then theyd be sure and call here\\n\\nmrs dashwood now looked at her daughter\\nbut elinor knew better than to expect them\\nshe recognised the whole of lucy in the message and was\\nvery confident that edward would never come near them\\nshe observed in a low voice to her mother that they\\nwere probably going down to mr pratts near plymouth\\n\\nthomass intelligence seemed over  elinor looked\\nas if she wished to hear more\\n\\ndid you see them off before you came away\\n\\nno maamthe horses were just coming out but i\\ncould not bide any longer i was afraid of being late\\n\\ndid mrs ferrars look well\\n\\nyes maam she said how she was very well\\nand to my mind she was always a very handsome young\\nladyand she seemed vastly contented\\n\\nmrs dashwood could think of no other question\\nand thomas and the tablecloth now alike needless\\nwere soon afterwards dismissed  marianne had already sent\\nto say that she should eat nothing more  mrs dashwoods\\nand elinors appetites were equally lost and margaret\\nmight think herself very well off that with so much\\nuneasiness as both her sisters had lately experienced\\nso much reason as they had often had to be careless\\nof their meals she had never been obliged to go without\\nher dinner before\\n\\nwhen the dessert and the wine were arranged\\nand mrs dashwood and elinor were left by themselves\\nthey remained long together in a similarity of thoughtfulness\\nand silence  mrs dashwood feared to hazard any remark\\nand ventured not to offer consolation  she now found\\nthat she had erred in relying on elinors representation\\nof herself and justly concluded that every thing\\nhad been expressly softened at the time to spare her\\nfrom an increase of unhappiness suffering as she then\\nhad suffered for marianne  she found that she had been\\nmisled by the careful the considerate attention of\\nher daughter to think the attachment which once she\\nhad so well understood much slighter in reality than\\nshe had been wont to believe or than it was now proved\\nto be  she feared that under this persuasion she had\\nbeen unjust inattentive nay almost unkind to her elinor\\nthat mariannes affliction because more acknowledged\\nmore immediately before her had too much engrossed\\nher tenderness and led her away to forget that in elinor\\nshe might have a daughter suffering almost as much\\ncertainly with less selfprovocation and greater fortitude\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 48\\n\\n\\nelinor now found the difference between the expectation\\nof an unpleasant event however certain the mind may be told\\nto consider it and certainty itself  she now found that\\nin spite of herself she had always admitted a hope\\nwhile edward remained single that something would occur\\nto prevent his marrying lucy that some resolution of\\nhis own some mediation of friends or some more eligible\\nopportunity of establishment for the lady would arise\\nto assist the happiness of all  but he was now married\\nand she condemned her heart for the lurking flattery\\nwhich so much heightened the pain of the intelligence\\n\\nthat he should be married soon before as she imagined\\nhe could be in orders and consequently before he could\\nbe in possession of the living surprised her a little\\nat first  but she soon saw how likely it was that lucy\\nin her selfprovident care in her haste to secure him\\nshould overlook every thing but the risk of delay\\nthey were married married in town and now hastening\\ndown to her uncles  what had edward felt on being within\\nfour miles from barton on seeing her mothers servant\\non hearing lucys

avoid\\nshe saw them in an instant in their parsonagehouse saw\\nin lucy the active contriving manager uniting at once\\na desire of smart appearance with the utmost frugality\\nand ashamed to be suspected of half her economical practices\\npursuing her own interest in every thought courting the\\nfavour of colonel brandon of mrs jennings and of every\\nwealthy friend  in edwardshe knew not what she saw\\nnor what she wished to seehappy or unhappynothing\\npleased her she turned away her head from every sketch of him\\n\\nelinor flattered herself that some one of their\\nconnections in london would write to them to announce\\nthe event and give farther particularsbut day after\\nday passed off and brought no letter no tidings\\nthough uncertain that any one were to blame she found\\nfault with every absent friend  they were all thoughtless\\nor indolent\\n\\nwhen do you write to colonel brandon maam\\nwas an inquiry which sprung from the impatience\\nof her mind to have something going on\\n\\ni wrote to him my love last week and rather\\nexpect to see than to hear from him again  i earnestly\\npressed his coming to us and should not be surprised\\nto see him walk in today or tomorrow or any day\\n\\nthis was gaining something something to look forward to\\ncolonel brandon must have some information to give\\n\\nscarcely had she so determined it when the figure\\nof a man on horseback drew her eyes to the window\\nhe stopt at their gate  it was a gentleman it\\nwas colonel brandon himself  now she could hear more\\nand she trembled in expectation of

understand\\nthat she hoped no coolness no slight would appear\\nin their behaviour to himbut she had no utterance\\nand was obliged to leave all to their own discretion\\n\\nnot a syllable passed aloud  they all waited\\nin silence for the appearance of their visitor\\nhis footsteps were heard along the gravel path in a moment\\nhe was in the passage and in another he was before them\\n\\nhis countenance as he entered the room was not\\ntoo happy even for elinor  his complexion was white\\nwith agitation and he looked as if fearful of his\\nreception and conscious that he merited no kind one\\nmrs dashwood however conforming as she trusted\\nto the wishes of that daughter by whom she then meant\\nin the warmth of her heart to be guided in every thing\\nmet with a look of forced complacency gave him her hand\\nand wished him joy\\n\\nhe coloured and stammered out an unintelligible reply\\nelinors lips had moved with her mothers and when the\\nmoment of action was over she wished that she had shaken\\nhands with him too  but it was then too late and with a\\ncountenance meaning to be open she sat down again\\nand talked of the weather\\n\\nmarianne had retreated as much as possible\\nout of sight to conceal her distress and margaret\\nunderstanding some part but not the whole of the case\\nthought it incumbent on her to be dignified and therefore\\ntook a seat as far from him as she could and maintained\\na strict silence\\n\\nwhen elinor had ceased to rejoice in the dryness\\nof the season a very awful pause took place  it was put\\nan end to by mrs dashwood who felt obliged to hope that he\\nhad left mrs ferrars very well  in a hurried manner\\nhe replied in the affirmative\\n\\nanother pause\\n\\nelinor resolving to exert herself though fearing\\nthe sound of her own voice now said\\n\\nis mrs ferrars at longstaple\\n\\nat longstaple he replied with an air of surprise\\nno my mother is in town\\n\\ni meant said elinor taking up some work from\\nthe table to inquire for mrs edward ferrars\\n\\nshe dared not look upbut her mother and marianne both\\nturned their eyes on him  he coloured seemed perplexed\\nlooked doubtingly and after some hesitation said\\n\\nperhaps you meanmy brotheryou mean mrsmrs\\nrobert ferrars\\n\\nmrs robert ferrarswas repeated by marianne and her\\nmother in an accent of the utmost amazementand though\\nelinor could not speak even her eyes were fixed on him\\nwith the same impatient wonder  he rose from his seat\\nand walked to the window apparently from not knowing\\nwhat to do took up a pair of scissors that lay there\\nand while spoiling both them and their sheath by cutting\\nthe latter to pieces as he spoke said in a hurried voice\\n\\nperhaps you do not knowyou may not have heard\\nthat my brother is lately married toto the youngestto\\nmiss lucy steele\\n\\nhis words were echoed with unspeakable astonishment\\nby all but elinor who sat with her head leaning over\\nher work in a state of such agitation as made her hardly\\nknow where she was\\n\\nyes said he they were married last week\\nand are now at dawlish\\n\\nelinor could sit it no longer  she almost ran\\nout of the room and as soon as the door was closed\\nburst into tears of joy which at first she thought would\\nnever cease  edward who had till then looked any where\\nrather than at her saw her hurry away and perhaps saw\\nor even heard her emotion for immediately afterwards\\nhe fell into a reverie which no remarks no inquiries\\nno affectionate address of mrs dashwood could penetrate\\nand at last without saying a word quitted the room\\nand walked out towards the villageleaving the others\\nin the greatest astonishment and perplexity on a change\\nin his situation so wonderful and so suddena perplexity\\nwhich they had no means of lessening but by their\\nown conjectures\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 49\\n\\n\\nunaccountable however as the circumstances of his\\nrelease might appear to the whole family it was certain\\nthat edward was free and to what purpose that freedom would\\nbe employed was easily predetermined by allfor after\\nexperiencing the blessings of one imprudent engagement\\ncontracted without his mothers consent as he had already\\ndone for more than four years nothing less could be expected\\nof him in the failure of that than the immediate contraction\\nof another\\n\\nhis errand at barton in fact was a simple one\\nit was only to ask elinor to marry himand considering\\nthat he was not altogether inexperienced in such a question\\nit might be strange that he should feel so uncomfortable\\nin the present case as he really did so much in need of\\nencouragement and fresh air\\n\\nhow soon he had walked himself into the proper\\nresolution however how soon an opportunity of exercising\\nit occurred in what manner he expressed himself\\nand how he was received need not be particularly told\\nthis only need be saidthat when they all sat down to\\ntable at four oclock about three hours after his arrival\\nhe had secured his lady engaged her mothers consent\\nand was not only in the rapturous profession of\\nthe lover but in the reality of reason and truth\\none of the happiest of men  his situation indeed was\\nmore than commonly joyful  he had more than the ordinary\\ntriumph of accepted love to swell his heart and raise\\nhis spirits  he was released without any reproach\\nto himself from an entanglement which had long formed\\nhis misery from a woman whom he had long ceased to love\\nand elevated at once to that security with another\\nwhich he must have thought of almost with despair\\nas soon as he had learnt to consider it with desire\\nhe was brought not from doubt or suspense but from\\nmisery to happinessand the change was openly spoken\\nin such a genuine flowing grateful cheerfulness\\nas his friends had never witnessed in him before\\n\\nhis heart was now open to elinor all its weaknesses\\nall its errors confessed and his first boyish attachment\\nto lucy treated with all the philosophic dignity of twentyfour\\n\\nit was a foolish idle inclination on my side\\nsaid he the consequence of ignorance of the world\\nand want of employment  had my brother given me\\nsome active profession when i was removed at eighteen\\nfrom the care of mr pratt i thinknay i am sure\\nit would never have happened for though i left longstaple\\nwith what i thought at the time a most unconquerable\\npreference for his niece yet had i then had any pursuit\\nany object to engage my time and keep me at a distance\\nfrom her for a few months i should very soon have\\noutgrown the fancied attachment especially by mixing\\nmore with the world as in such case i must have done\\nbut instead of having any thing to do instead of having any\\nprofession chosen for me or being allowed to chuse any myself\\ni returned home to be completely idle and for the first\\ntwelvemonth afterwards i had not even the nominal employment\\nwhich belonging to the university would have given me\\nfor i was not entered at oxford till i was nineteen\\ni had therefore nothing in the world to do but to fancy\\nmyself in love and as my mother did not make my home\\nin every respect comfortable as i had no friend\\nno companion in my brother and disliked new acquaintance\\nit was not unnatural for me to be very often at longstaple\\nwhere i always felt myself at home and was always sure\\nof a welcome and accordingly i spent the greatest part\\nof my time there from eighteen to nineteen lucy appeared\\neverything that was amiable and obliging  she was pretty\\ntooat least i thought so then and i had seen so little\\nof other women that i could make no comparisons and see\\nno defects  considering everything therefore i hope\\nfoolish as our engagement was foolish as it has since\\nin every way been proved it was not at the time an unnatural\\nor an inexcusable piece of folly\\n\\nthe change which a few hours had wrought in the minds\\nand the happiness of the dashwoods was suchso greatas\\npromised them all the satisfaction of a sleepless night\\nmrs dashwood too happy to be comfortable knew not how\\nto love edward nor praise elinor enough how to be enough\\nthankful for his release without wounding his delicacy\\nnor how at once to give them leisure for unrestrained\\nconversation together and yet enjoy as she wished\\nthe sight and society of both\\n\\nmarianne could speak her happiness only by tears\\ncomparisons would occurregrets would ariseand her joy\\nthough sincere as her love for her sister was of a kind to\\ngive her neither spirits nor language\\n\\nbut elinorhow are her feelings to be describedfrom\\nthe moment of learning that lucy was married to another\\nthat edward was free to the moment of his justifying\\nthe hopes which had so instantly followed she was every\\nthing by turns but tranquil  but when the second moment\\nhad passed when she found every doubt every solicitude\\nremoved compared her situation with what so lately it\\nhad beensaw him honourably released from his former\\nengagement saw him instantly profiting by the release\\nto address herself and declare an affection as tender\\nas constant as she had ever supposed it to beshe\\nwas oppressed she was overcome by her own felicity\\nand happily disposed as is the human mind to be easily\\nfamiliarized with any change for the better it required\\nseveral hours to give sedateness to her spirits or any\\ndegree of tranquillity to her heart\\n\\nedward was now fixed at the cottage at least for\\na weekfor whatever other claims might be made on him\\nit was impossible that less than a week should be given\\nup to the enjoyment of elinors company or suffice\\nto say half that was to be said of the past the present\\nand the futurefor though a very few hours spent in\\nthe hard labor of incessant talking will despatch more\\nsubjects than can really be in common between any

only attempt an explanation by supposing\\nthat perhaps at first accidentally meeting the vanity\\nof the one had been so worked on by the flattery\\nof the other as to lead by degrees to all the rest\\nelinor remembered what robert had told her in harley street\\nof his opinion of what his own mediation in his brothers\\naffairs might have done if applied to in time\\nshe repeated it to

any of his family\\nhad yet been attempted by him  he had quitted oxford\\nwithin four and twenty hours after lucys letter arrived\\nand with only one object before him the nearest road\\nto barton had had no leisure to form any scheme of conduct\\nwith which that road did not hold the most intimate connection\\nhe could do nothing till he were assured of his fate with\\nmiss dashwood and by his rapidity in seeking that fate\\nit is to be supposed in spite of the jealousy with\\nwhich he had once thought of colonel brandon in spite\\nof the modesty with which he rated his own deserts\\nand the politeness with which he talked of his doubts\\nhe did not upon the whole expect a very cruel reception\\nit was his business however to say that he did and he\\nsaid it very prettily  what he might say on the subject\\na twelvemonth after must be referred to the imagination\\nof husbands and wives\\n\\nthat lucy had certainly meant to deceive to go off\\nwith a flourish of malice against him in her message\\nby thomas was perfectly clear to elinor and edward himself\\nnow thoroughly enlightened on her character had no\\nscruple in believing her capable of the utmost meanness\\nof wanton illnature though his eyes had been long opened\\neven before his acquaintance with elinor began to her\\nignorance and a want of liberality in some of her opinions\\nthey had been equally imputed by him to her want\\nof education and till her last letter reached him\\nhe had always believed her to be a welldisposed\\ngoodhearted girl and thoroughly attached to himself\\nnothing but such a persuasion could have prevented\\nhis putting an end to an engagement which long before\\nthe discovery of it laid him open to his mothers anger\\nhad been a continual source of disquiet and regret to him\\n\\ni thought it my duty said he independent of my feelings\\nto give her the option of continuing the engagement or not\\nwhen i was renounced by my mother and stood to all\\nappearance without a friend in the world to assist me\\nin such a situation as that where there seemed nothing\\nto tempt the avarice or the vanity of any living creature\\nhow could i suppose when she so earnestly so warmly insisted\\non sharing my fate whatever it might be that any thing\\nbut the most disinterested affection was her inducement\\nand even now i cannot comprehend on what motive she acted\\nor what fancied advantage it could be to her to be\\nfettered to a man for whom she had not the smallest regard\\nand who had only two thousand pounds in the world\\nshe could not foresee that colonel brandon would give me a\\nliving\\n\\nno but she might suppose that something would occur\\nin your favour that your own family might in time relent\\nand at any rate she lost nothing by continuing the engagement\\nfor she has proved that it fettered neither her inclination\\nnor her actions  the connection was certainly a\\nrespectable one and probably gained her consideration among\\nher friends and if nothing more advantageous occurred\\nit would be better for her to marry you than be single\\n\\nedward was of course immediately convinced that\\nnothing could have been more natural than lucys conduct\\nnor more selfevident than the motive of it\\n\\nelinor scolded him harshly as ladies always scold\\nthe imprudence which compliments themselves for having\\nspent so much time with them at norland when he must\\nhave felt his own inconstancy\\n\\nyour behaviour was certainly very wrong said she\\nbecauseto say nothing of my own conviction our relations\\nwere all led away by it to fancy and expect what as you\\nwere then situated could never be\\n\\nhe could only plead an ignorance of his own heart\\nand a mistaken confidence in the force of his engagement\\n\\ni was simple enough to think that because my faith\\nwas plighted to another there could be no danger in my being\\nwith you and that the consciousness of my engagement was\\nto keep my heart as safe and sacred as my honour  i felt\\nthat i admired you but i told myself it was only friendship\\nand till i began to make comparisons between yourself\\nand lucy i did not know how far i was got  after that\\ni suppose i was wrong in remaining so much in sussex\\nand the arguments with which i reconciled myself to the\\nexpediency of it were no better than thesethe danger\\nis my own i am doing no injury to anybody but myself\\n\\nelinor smiled and shook her head\\n\\nedward heard with pleasure of colonel brandons\\nbeing expected at the cottage as he really wished\\nnot only to be better acquainted with him but to have an\\nopportunity of convincing him that he no longer resented\\nhis giving him the living of delafordwhich at present\\nsaid he after thanks so ungraciously delivered as mine\\nwere on the occasion he must think i have never forgiven\\nhim for offering\\n\\nnow he felt astonished himself that he had never yet\\nbeen to the place  but so little interest had be taken\\nin the matter that he owed all his knowledge of the house\\ngarden and glebe extent of the parish condition of\\nthe land and rate of the tithes to elinor herself\\nwho had heard so much of it from colonel brandon\\nand heard it with so much attention as to be entirely\\nmistress of the subject\\n\\none question after this only remained undecided\\nbetween them one difficulty only was to be overcome\\nthey were brought together by mutual affection\\nwith the warmest approbation of their real friends\\ntheir intimate knowledge of each other seemed to make\\ntheir happiness certainand they only wanted something\\nto live upon  edward had two thousand pounds and elinor\\none which with delaford living was all that they could\\ncall their own for it was impossible that mrs dashwood\\nshould advance anything and they were neither of them\\nquite enough in love to think that three hundred and fifty\\npounds ayear would supply them with the comforts of life\\n\\nedward was not entirely without hopes of some\\nfavourable change in his mother towards him and on that\\nhe rested for the residue of their income  but elinor\\nhad no such dependence for since edward would still\\nbe unable to marry miss morton and his chusing herself\\nhad been spoken of in mrs ferrarss flattering language\\nas only a lesser evil than his chusing lucy steele\\nshe feared that roberts offence would serve no other\\npurpose than to enrich fanny\\n\\nabout four days after edwards arrival colonel\\nbrandon appeared to complete mrs dashwoods satisfaction\\nand to give her the dignity of having for the first time\\nsince her living at barton more company with her than\\nher house would hold  edward was allowed to retain the\\nprivilege of first comer and colonel brandon therefore\\nwalked every night to his old quarters at the park\\nfrom whence he usually returned in the morning early enough\\nto interrupt the lovers first teteatete before breakfast\\n\\na three weeks residence at delaford where\\nin his evening hours at least he had little to do\\nbut to calculate the disproportion between thirtysix\\nand seventeen brought him to barton in a temper of mind\\nwhich needed all the improvement in mariannes looks\\nall the kindness of her welcome and all the encouragement\\nof her mothers language to make it cheerful\\namong such friends however and such flattery he did revive\\nno rumour of lucys marriage had yet reached himhe knew\\nnothing of what had passed and the first hours of his\\nvisit were consequently spent in hearing and in wondering\\nevery thing was explained to him by mrs dashwood\\nand he found fresh reason to rejoice in what he had done\\nfor mr ferrars since eventually it promoted the interest\\nof elinor\\n\\nit would be needless to say that the gentlemen advanced\\nin the good opinion of each other as they advanced in each\\nothers acquaintance for it could not be otherwise\\ntheir resemblance in good principles and good sense\\nin disposition and manner of thinking would probably\\nhave been sufficient to unite them in friendship\\nwithout any other attraction but their being in love\\nwith two sisters and two sisters fond of each other\\nmade that mutual regard inevitable and immediate\\nwhich might otherwise have waited the effect of time\\nand judgment\\n\\nthe letters from town which a few days before would\\nhave made every nerve in elinors body thrill with transport\\nnow arrived to be read with less emotion that mirth\\nmrs jennings wrote to tell the wonderful tale to vent her\\nhonest indignation against the jilting girl and pour forth\\nher compassion towards poor mr edward who she was sure\\nhad quite doted upon the worthless hussy and was now\\nby all accounts almost brokenhearted at oxford\\ni do think she continued nothing was ever carried\\non so sly for it was but two days before lucy called\\nand sat a couple of hours with me  not a soul suspected\\nanything of the matter not even nancy who poor soul\\ncame crying to me the day after in a great fright\\nfor fear of mrs ferrars as well as not knowing how to\\nget to plymouth for lucy it seems borrowed all her\\nmoney before she went off to be married on purpose\\nwe suppose to make a show with and poor nancy had not\\nseven shillings in the worldso i was very glad to give\\nher five guineas to take her down to exeter where she\\nthinks of staying three or four weeks with mrs burgess\\nin hopes as i tell her to fall in with the doctor again\\nand i must say that lucys crossness not to take them\\nalong with them in the chaise is worse than all\\npoor mr edward i cannot get him out of my head but you\\nmust send for him to barton and miss marianne must try to\\ncomfort him\\n\\nmr dashwoods strains were more solemn\\nmrs ferrars was the most unfortunate of womenpoor\\nfanny had suffered agonies of sensibilityand he\\nconsidered the existence of each under such a blow\\nwith grateful wonder  roberts offence was unpardonable\\nbut lucys was infinitely worse  neither of them were\\never again to be mentioned to mrs ferrars and even\\nif she might hereafter be induced to forgive her son\\nhis wife should never be acknowledged as her daughter\\nnor be permitted to appear in her presence  the secrecy\\nwith which everything had been carried on between them\\nwas rationally treated as enormously heightening\\nthe crime because had any suspicion of it occurred\\nto the others proper measures would have been taken\\nto prevent the marriage and he called on elinor to join\\nwith him in regretting that lucys engagement with edward\\nhad not rather been fulfilled than that she should thus\\nbe the means of spreading misery farther in the family\\nhe thus continued\\n\\nmrs ferrars has never yet mentioned edwards name\\nwhich does not surprise us but to our great astonishment\\nnot a line has been received from him on the occasion\\nperhaps however he is kept silent by his fear of offending\\nand i shall therefore give him a hint by a line\\nto oxford that his sister and i both think a letter\\nof proper submission from him addressed perhaps to fanny\\nand by her shewn to her mother might not be taken amiss\\nfor we all know the tenderness of mrs ferrarss heart\\nand that she wishes for nothing so much as to be on good terms\\nwith her children\\n\\nthis paragraph was of some importance to the\\nprospects and conduct of edward  it determined him\\nto attempt a reconciliation though not exactly\\nin the manner pointed out by their brother and sister\\n\\na letter of proper submission repeated he\\nwould they have me beg my mothers pardon for roberts\\ningratitude to her and breach of honour to mei can\\nmake no submissioni am grown neither humble nor\\npenitent by what has passedi am grown very happy\\nbut that would not interesti know of no submission\\nthat is proper for me to make\\n\\nyou may certainly ask to be forgiven said elinor\\nbecause you have offendedand i should think you\\nmight now venture so far as to profess some concern\\nfor having ever formed the engagement which drew on you\\nyour mothers anger\\n\\nhe agreed that he might\\n\\nand when she has forgiven you perhaps a little humility\\nmay be convenient while acknowledging a second engagement\\nalmost as imprudent in her eyes as the first\\n\\nhe had nothing to urge against it but still\\nresisted the idea of a letter of proper submission\\nand therefore to make it easier to him as he declared\\na much greater willingness to make mean concessions\\nby word of mouth than on paper it was resolved that\\ninstead of writing to fanny he should go to london\\nand personally intreat her good offices in his favour\\nand if they really do interest themselves said marianne\\nin her new character of candour in bringing about\\na reconciliation i shall think that even john and fanny\\nare not entirely without merit\\n\\nafter a visit on colonel brandons side of only three\\nor four days the two gentlemen quitted barton together\\nthey were to go immediately to delaford that edward\\nmight have some personal knowledge of his future home\\nand assist his patron and friend in deciding on what\\nimprovements were needed to it and from thence\\nafter staying there a couple of nights he was to proceed\\non his journey to town\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 50\\n\\n\\nafter a proper resistance on the part of mrs ferrars\\njust so violent and so steady as to preserve her from that\\nreproach which she always seemed fearful of incurring\\nthe reproach of being too amiable edward was admitted\\nto her presence and pronounced to be again her son\\n\\nher family had of late been exceedingly fluctuating\\nfor many years of her life she had had two sons\\nbut the crime and annihilation of edward a few weeks ago\\nhad robbed her of one the similar annihilation of robert\\nhad left her for a fortnight without any and now\\nby the resuscitation of edward she had one again\\n\\nin spite of his being allowed once more to live\\nhowever he did not feel the continuance of his existence\\nsecure till he had revealed his present engagement\\nfor the publication of that circumstance he feared\\nmight give a sudden turn to his constitution and carry\\nhim off as rapidly as before  with apprehensive caution\\ntherefore it was revealed and he was listened to with\\nunexpected calmness  mrs ferrars at first reasonably\\nendeavoured to dissuade him from marrying miss dashwood\\nby every argument in her powertold him that in miss morton\\nhe would have a woman of higher rank and larger fortune\\nand enforced the assertion by observing that miss morton\\nwas the daughter of a nobleman with thirty thousand pounds\\nwhile miss dashwood was only the daughter of a private\\ngentleman with no more than three but when she found that\\nthough perfectly admitting the truth of her representation\\nhe was by no means inclined to be guided by it\\nshe judged it wisest from the experience of the past\\nto submitand therefore after such an ungracious delay\\nas she owed to her own dignity and as served to prevent\\nevery suspicion of goodwill she issued her decree\\nof consent to the marriage of edward and elinor\\n\\nwhat she would engage to do towards augmenting\\ntheir income was next to be considered and here it\\nplainly appeared that though edward was now her only son\\nhe was by no means her eldest for while robert was\\ninevitably endowed with a thousand pounds ayear\\nnot the smallest objection was made against edwards taking\\norders for the sake of two hundred and fifty at the utmost\\nnor was anything promised either for the present or in future\\nbeyond the ten thousand pounds which had been given with fanny\\n\\nit was as much however as was desired\\nand more than was expected by edward and elinor\\nand mrs ferrars herself by her shuffling excuses\\nseemed the only person surprised at her not giving more\\n\\nwith an income quite sufficient to their wants\\nthus secured to them they had nothing to wait for\\nafter edward was in possession of the living but the\\nreadiness of the house to which colonel brandon\\nwith an eager desire for the accommodation of elinor\\nwas making considerable improvements and after waiting\\nsome time for their completion after experiencing\\nas usual a thousand disappointments and delays\\nfrom the unaccountable dilatoriness of the workmen elinor\\nas usual broke through the first positive resolution\\nof not marrying till every thing was ready and the\\nceremony took place in barton church early in the autumn\\n\\nthe first month after their marriage was spent\\nwith their friend at the mansionhouse from whence\\nthey could superintend the progress of the parsonage\\nand direct every thing as they liked on the spot\\ncould chuse papers project shrubberies and invent a sweep\\nmrs jenningss prophecies though rather jumbled together\\nwere chiefly fulfilled for she was able to visit edward\\nand his wife in their parsonage by michaelmas and she\\nfound in elinor and her husband as she really believed\\none of the happiest couples in the world  they had\\nin fact nothing to wish for but the marriage of colonel\\nbrandon and marianne and rather better pasturage for\\ntheir cows\\n\\nthey were visited on their first settling by almost\\nall their relations and friends  mrs ferrars came\\nto inspect the happiness which she was almost ashamed\\nof having authorised and even the dashwoods were at\\nthe expense of a journey from sussex to do them honour\\n\\ni will not say that i am disappointed my dear sister\\nsaid john as they were walking together one morning before\\nthe gates of delaford house that would be saying too much\\nfor certainly you have been one of the most fortunate young\\nwomen in the world as it is  but i confess it would\\ngive me great pleasure to call colonel brandon brother\\nhis property here his place his house every thing is in\\nsuch respectable and excellent conditionand his woodsi\\nhave not seen such timber any where in dorsetshire as there\\nis now standing in delaford hangerand though perhaps\\nmarianne may not seem exactly the person to attract him\\nyet i think it would altogether be advisable for you to\\nhave them now frequently staying with you for as colonel\\nbrandon seems a great deal at home nobody can tell what\\nmay happenfor when people are much thrown together\\nand see little of anybody elseand it will always be\\nin your power to set her off to advantage and so forth\\nin short you may as well give her a chanceyou understand\\nme\\n\\nbut though mrs ferrars did come to see them and always\\ntreated them with the makebelieve of decent affection\\nthey were never insulted by her real favour and preference\\nthat was due to the folly of robert and the cunning\\nof his wife and it was earned by them before many months\\nhad passed away  the selfish sagacity of the latter\\nwhich had at first drawn robert into the scrape\\nwas the principal instrument of his deliverance from it\\nfor her respectful humility assiduous attentions\\nand endless flatteries as soon as the smallest opening\\nwas given for their exercise reconciled mrs ferrars\\nto his choice and reestablished him completely in\\nher favour\\n\\nthe whole of lucys behaviour in the affair\\nand the prosperity which crowned it therefore may be held\\nforth as a most encouraging instance of what an earnest\\nan unceasing attention to selfinterest however its progress\\nmay be apparently obstructed will do in securing every\\nadvantage of fortune with no other sacrifice than that of time\\nand conscience  when robert first sought her acquaintance\\nand privately visited her in bartletts buildings\\nit was only with the view imputed to him by his brother\\nhe merely meant to persuade her to give up the engagement\\nand as there could be nothing to overcome but the affection\\nof both he naturally expected that one or two interviews\\nwould settle the matter  in that point however\\nand that only he erredfor though lucy soon gave him\\nhopes that his eloquence would convince her in time\\nanother visit another conversation was always wanted\\nto produce this conviction  some doubts always lingered\\nin her mind when they parted which could only be\\nremoved by another half hours discourse with himself\\nhis attendance was by this means secured and the rest\\nfollowed in course  instead of talking of edward\\nthey came gradually to talk only of roberta subject\\non which he had always more to say than on any other\\nand in which she soon betrayed an interest even equal\\nto his own and in short it became speedily evident\\nto both that he had entirely supplanted his brother\\nhe was proud of his conquest proud of tricking edward\\nand very proud of marrying privately without his\\nmothers consent  what immediately followed is known\\nthey passed some months in great happiness at dawlish\\nfor she had many relations and old acquaintances to\\ncutand he drew several plans for magnificent cottages\\nand from thence returning to town procured the forgiveness\\nof mrs ferrars by the simple expedient of asking it\\nwhich at lucys instigation was adopted  the forgiveness\\nat first indeed as was reasonable comprehended only robert\\nand lucy who had owed his mother no duty and therefore\\ncould have transgressed none still remained some weeks\\nlonger unpardoned  but perseverance in humility of conduct\\nand messages in selfcondemnation for roberts offence\\nand gratitude for the unkindness she was treated with\\nprocured her in time the haughty notice which overcame\\nher by its graciousness and led soon afterwards by rapid\\ndegrees to the highest state of affection and influence\\nlucy became as necessary to mrs ferrars as either robert\\nor fanny and while edward was never cordially forgiven\\nfor having once intended to marry her and elinor\\nthough superior to her in fortune and birth was spoken\\nof as an intruder she was in every thing considered\\nand always openly acknowledged to be a favourite child\\nthey settled in town received very liberal assistance\\nfrom mrs ferrars were on the best terms imaginable\\nwith the dashwoods and setting aside the jealousies\\nand illwill continually subsisting between fanny and lucy\\nin which their husbands of course took a part as well\\nas the frequent domestic disagreements between robert and\\nlucy themselves nothing could exceed the harmony in which\\nthey all lived together\\n\\nwhat edward had done to forfeit the right of eldest\\nson might have puzzled many people to find out and what\\nrobert had done to succeed to it might have puzzled them\\nstill more  it was an arrangement however justified in\\nits effects if not in its cause for nothing ever\\nappeared in roberts style of living or of talking to give\\na suspicion of his regretting the extent of his income\\nas either leaving his brother too little or bringing\\nhimself too muchand if edward might be judged from\\nthe ready discharge of his duties in every particular\\nfrom an increasing attachment to his wife and his home\\nand from the regular cheerfulness of his spirits\\nhe might be supposed no less contented with his lot\\nno less free from every wish of an exchange\\n\\nelinors marriage divided her as little from her\\nfamily as could well be contrived without rendering\\nthe cottage at barton entirely useless for her mother\\nand sisters spent much more than half their time with her\\nmrs dashwood was acting on motives of policy as well\\nas pleasure in the frequency of her visits at delaford\\nfor her wish of bringing marianne and colonel brandon together\\nwas hardly less earnest though rather more liberal than\\nwhat john had expressed  it was now her darling object\\nprecious as was the company of her daughter to her\\nshe desired nothing so much as to give up its constant\\nenjoyment to her valued friend and to see marianne settled at\\nthe mansionhouse was equally the wish of edward and elinor\\nthey each felt his sorrows and their own obligations\\nand marianne by general consent was to be the reward\\nof all\\n\\nwith such a confederacy against herwith a knowledge\\nso intimate of his goodnesswith a conviction of his fond\\nattachment to herself which at last though long after it\\nwas
